[0.60 - 21.55] IRA GLASS: We first broadcast today's radio program a year ago. And just that week, a politician did something that you almost never see a politician do. He apologized for something, and it seemed completely sincere. This was Republican Congressman Geoff Davis from Kentucky. And he'd written a letter to then presidential candidate Barack Obama, it said-- I have this here.
[21.55 - 57.19] IRA GLASS: "Dear Senator Obama, On Saturday night I gave a speech in which I used a poor choice of words when discussing the national security policy positions of the presidential candidates. I was quoted as saying, 'That boy's finger does not need to be on the button.' My poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or your integrity. I offer my sincere apology to you, and I ask for your forgiveness. Though we may disagree on many issues, I know that we share a goal of a prosperous, secure future for our nation. My comment has detracted from the dialogue that we should all be having on legitimate policy differences and in no way reflects the personal and professional respect I have for you. Sincerely, Geoff Davis."
[57.19 - 85.41] IRA GLASS: OK, right? Nice job. Nice job. The same week that he issued that apology, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were actually getting a lot of criticism in the press, and from the public, for making what seemed like the typical kinds of non-apology apologies that politicians always make. In this case, it was Obama for comments that he had made about small town America. You may remember. And Hillary Clinton for saying that she flew into Bosnia under sniper fire. But that didn't really happen.
[85.41 - 104.73] IRA GLASS: With Clinton, especially, her apology seemed to be very pro forma. She regretted the error. She did not seem very sorry. She didn't actually seem to understand why her memory lapse would be troubling to voters. It didn't seem like she felt like she'd actually messed up. Mistakes were made. You know?
[104.73 - 127.46] IRA GLASS: Anyway, that same week that all this happened, I was interviewing this guy for the radio show about something else. And somehow, we got on the subject of this apology business. And he has two daughters, and they were both around 13 years old. And he says that whenever one of his daughters does something to the other, and he tells them to apologize-- you know, as the parent-- usually, the apology is fake. Usually, it's pro forma.
[127.46 - 133.88] IRA GLASS: It's basically the kid version of a politician's non-apology apology. And what do you do with that?
[133.88 - 162.67] DEREK JONES: Because how do you make somebody actually feel sorry for something they don't feel sorry for? There they are, and you're like, "Say you're sorry, say it like you mean it." And they don't mean it. And they're not going to. They don't yet have the empathy. Trying to explain to one of them, look, the way your sister feels is, they go through life, they share with you, and then when you aren't generous with them that makes them feel-- you're trying to explain it like this. And you can see the look in their eye, like this cold, steely look.
[162.67 - 179.67] DEREK JONES: Like, I hear what you're saying, I hear your little fable. I'm just not buying it. And I don't know. They'll do lip service to it. They'll kind of sigh and shrug and, in a sense, allow that, perhaps, that's the case. And then they take another shot at the apology.
[179.67 - 186.47] IRA GLASS: But as a parent, don't you feel like, well, OK, if all I'm going to get is lip service, at least I'm going to get the lip service. At least they recognize--
[186.47 - 187.02] DEREK JONES: Yes, sir.
[187.02 - 188.31] IRA GLASS: -- a moral code.
[188.31 - 194.50] DEREK JONES: Even if your heart's not in this, I want to watch you go through the motions. This is what people do when they really are sorry.
[194.50 - 224.40] IRA GLASS: See, but that makes me feel more sympathetic to politicians or to this act which actually, usually fills me with contempt. I feel like, well, at least the politician is pretending and acknowledging, yes, there is a moral code. They don't feel sorry, but they'll acknowledge that someone should feel sorry. And I feel like, well, if that's what we're going to get out of our politicians, well, OK. I guess it's not what I want, but I can kind of live with that.
[224.40 - 237.64] DEREK JONES: Well, I don't know if you are familiar with all the details of that Bible story about David and Bathsheba. It's almost this funny modern politics story, right?
[237.64 - 239.10] IRA GLASS: No, I don't know this one.
[239.10 - 264.27] DEREK JONES: Oh, OK. Well, so here's King David, powerful king of Israel. And he basically commits adultery in office. He sees a woman that he can have because of his power, who's not his wife, and arranges her to come to the palace and has his way with her. And then, the story's going to break. Her husband's going to find out. And he, in a very modern way, tries to quell the story, quash it, before it gets out.
[264.27 - 300.91] DEREK JONES: He has her husband sent to the front lines of battle, where he gets killed. He does everything he can to hope that he can just actually hide it. He does not feel sorry about it. And he really digs himself in deep. And time goes on. And a prophet becomes aware of this, divinely, and comes to confront David on it. And what does he do? He tells him a story. He gets him engaged in this little fable about somebody who has a pet lamb, a poor man with a pet lamb that he loves like a pet. And that a rich man goes and gets that lamb and prepares it for a meal.
[300.91 - 306.40] DEREK JONES: Because of his power, he's able to-- the poor man's like a serf who lives on his land, so the rich man is just like, hey, I'm--
[306.40 - 307.15] IRA GLASS: I'm taking that.
[307.15 - 325.28] DEREK JONES: Yeah. Because everything you have is mine. So it's this really awful thing of something that someone else valued very highly, was valued very low by the rich man just because of his power. But Nathan's not telling him this story like it's a fable. He's telling him like, this is happening in your kingdom. What are you going to do about it?
[325.28 - 344.80] DEREK JONES: David gets all enraged on behalf of the victim and says, bring him here. We're going to do justice on him. We're going to see this done right. We're going to bring that rich man here, and we're going to punish him to the full extent of the law. And so David is demanding justice for the perpetrator. And the prophet looks at him and says, you are the man. And that does it.
[344.80 - 365.05] DEREK JONES: Then David really gets it, and he comes apart. And he has a very genuine apology and repentance. But he does really end up paying for it. And he's a much better king afterward. And so if you could sit down Clinton or Obama-- and I don't know, you'd have to do something like that maybe.
[365.05 - 369.39] IRA GLASS: What's sad is that they both know this story. They're always talking about how they're always going to church.
[369.39 - 373.41] DEREK JONES: Yeah. That's a good point.
[373.41 - 375.01] IRA GLASS: They've already heard this story.
[375.01 - 391.12] DEREK JONES: Yeah. You wonder if one of their pastors will sit them down, tell them that story and then say, you are the man.
[391.12 - 405.15] IRA GLASS: Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. Today on our show, "Mistakes were made."
