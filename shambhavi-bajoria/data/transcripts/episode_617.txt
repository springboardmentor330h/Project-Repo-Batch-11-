[0.94 - 3.48] IRA GLASS: So are you thinking about this a lot??
[3.48 - 8.18] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I got sad about it on the training again this morning. It comes at totally random moments, you know?
[8.18 - 20.05] IRA GLASS: That's David Kestenbaum, one of the producers of our program. And to understand what he's been sad about, I think it's not going to make any sense unless you know that he's a physicist. He has a PhD in particle physics.
[20.05 - 35.46] IRA GLASS: He was on one of the teams that discovered the top quark at Fermilab back in the '90s, before he became a journalist. So he thinks like a scientist. And he recently stumbled across a story he'd never heard before about Enrico Fermi, the physicist that Fermilab is actually named for.
[35.46 - 41.03] DAVID KESTENBAUM: So the story goes that this is 1950. Fermi's visiting Los Alamos.
[41.03 - 44.17] IRA GLASS: Los Alamos, where they developed the atomic bomb?
[44.17 - 52.49] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Yeah. And they're sitting around at lunch. It's Fermi and a handful of other physicists and they start talking about extraterrestrials.
[52.49 - 61.95] IRA GLASS: One of the scientists who was there remembers that they talked about some New Yorker cartoon, which had flying saucers and cheerful aliens stealing our trash cans. They joked about it.
[61.95 - 66.59] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And then out of nowhere, Fermi says something like, so where are they?
[66.59 - 68.59] IRA GLASS: Meaning?
[68.59 - 69.72] DAVID KESTENBAUM: The aliens.
[69.72 - 71.79] IRA GLASS: And did people know what he meant?
[71.79 - 92.79] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Yeah, somehow everybody knew exactly what he meant. The idea was basically that, like, the galaxy is this huge place, right? Hundreds of billions of stars. It's been around for billions of years. If you believe that intelligent life is something that just arises given enough time, where is everybody?
[92.79 - 108.24] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Like, there have been billions of years, where civilizations could have developed and become way more advanced than we are and traveled from star to star, sent signals or something. Where are they? If that's right, where are they?
[108.24 - 123.58] IRA GLASS: This question became known as the Fermi Paradox, which goes like this. If it's so likely that intelligent life exists elsewhere, where is it? Why hasn't anybody shown up? And of course, the simple answer to that would be, well, nobody else exists.
[123.58 - 137.95] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And I had never thought-- it made me think, maybe we're alone. I really thought that for the first time. Yeah, it made me really sad.
[137.95 - 148.52] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I had never thought about it seriously before. I had always assumed that life was everywhere. But he's making a really serious point here. He's raising a tough question.
[148.52 - 159.87] IRA GLASS: So for months now, when David's brushing his teeth or doing nothing in particular, it'll hit him again. Maybe we're alone in the universe. Like this morning, on the train.
[159.87 - 177.69] DAVID KESTENBAUM: The specific thought I was having was that this would mean that there's nobody out there who knows more than we do, like, about science, about-- there are no better songs. There are no better books. This is it, you know?
[177.69 - 178.66] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[178.66 - 184.32] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Like, what we know is it. What we are is it.
[184.32 - 191.17] IRA GLASS: Why is your response to this sadness?
[191.17 - 197.26] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Why is your response not sadness? Of course that's sad.
[197.26 - 216.57] IRA GLASS: This whole thing reminds me of just a really, really old Woody Allen movie-- it might be Annie Hall-- where there's a scene of him as a kid. And he's saying to some adult-- she's saying, why didn't you do your homework or something like that. And he's like, well, because the universe is expanding.
[216.57 - 224.95] IRA GLASS: And then the adult is like, why is that any of your business? And that's my question for you. Why is it any of your business?
[224.95 - 232.07] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Oh, I totally read that the other way. I was like, he's making a serious point. Why is no one listening to him?
[232.07 - 232.86] IRA GLASS: Oh.
[232.86 - 233.23] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHTER]
[233.23 - 251.21] DAVID KESTENBAUM: See, that's the problem. I'm in his shoes and I'm not making a joke. I feel like if you were able to really imagine it, it would make you sad.
[251.21 - 252.72] IRA GLASS: Oh, really?
[252.72 - 262.68] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Yeah. When you look up at the stars, do you think about what they are, and the distances and stuff, and all that?
[262.68 - 264.03] IRA GLASS: No, not in a deep way.
[264.03 - 273.47] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I mean, it's so easy not to feel anything. But it's a crazy thing you're looking at, just how small we are and how big it is.
[273.47 - 300.29] IRA GLASS: David tried to explain the feeling that he was having to me in a bunch of different ways. And the explanation that made the most sense to me was when he told me that he'd been looking at videos with his five-year-old son, Augie, who's really into space. Videos of the Apollo moon missions, with astronauts happily bouncing around on the lunar surface and driving in that moonbuggy they had. And David found himself just looking at where they were, really looking at the moon.
[300.29 - 310.84] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Oh, look how dead it is. There is nothing there. The moon is just this dusty, awful rock. And what if it's like that everywhere.
[310.84 - 322.99] DAVID KESTENBAUM: You know, liquid methane oceans and whatever rocks, but no life at all. What if that's the rest of the galaxy? Space just seemed like some horrible, awful, dangerous place to me.
[322.99 - 326.32] IRA GLASS: I see that. There's no hope. It's just death out there.
[326.32 - 332.48] DAVID KESTENBAUM: It's a lot of pressure if we're the only thing going on. It's a lonely thought.
[332.48 - 351.38] IRA GLASS: I first found out that David was thinking about all this at our staff story meeting a couple of weeks ago. And I'll be honest, when he told everybody that he was upset about the Fermi Paradox, we all laughed at him. Like OK, that's what's upsetting you? Which he gets, but it doesn't help him.
[351.38 - 355.27] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I can't find anyone to really talk it through with.
[355.27 - 357.86] IRA GLASS: Because none of us took it seriously?
[357.86 - 376.51] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Yeah. I feel like when I say it, people are like, yeah, I don't know, or I always thought that. The thing that bugs me about it is he's making a real scientific argument. I wanted to talk through the science of it with somebody. It's not just a "what do you think? I bet you they're there. I bet you they're not there." He's making up a physics point, you know?
[376.51 - 1368.84] IRA GLASS: Well, today on our radio program, stories from the one civilization we know does exist, stories of people who head out on missions here on our own planet to vanquish their own loneliness. We hear from a 9-year-old girl, a married couple, and of course, David. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. Stay with us.
[1368.84 - 1382.92] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, Fermi's Paradox. We have stories of people heading out on their own on very personal quest to figure out are we alone? We've arrived at Act 2 of our program. Act 2, "Two Can Be as Sad as One."
[1382.92 - 1406.17] IRA GLASS: We're in this show about loneliness. We now turn to one of the loneliest experiences a person can possibly have, and that's marriage. I think the thing that I was least prepared for in marriage is how lonely it can be, when things go badly, I mean. And there's this recording of this couple trying to get past all the stuff that's dividing them that I think illustrates really well how hard that can be and what it really means to do it.
[1406.17 - 1420.67] IRA GLASS: This recording is from this new podcast in which a real-life therapist records her real-life sessions with real couples who've agreed to be recorded. The therapist is Esther Perel, who's also the author of the books Mating in Captivity and the upcoming, The State of Affairs.
[1420.67 - 1439.10] IRA GLASS: I've listened to a few episodes of her podcast now, and OK, my mom was a marriage therapist. She wrote a book about her techniques and research. She did trainings for other therapists. I've been in couples counseling myself with my wife. So I know about this world, and I found listening to Perel to be completely fascinating.
[1439.10 - 1467.10] IRA GLASS: She's a very active therapist. I think that's the best way to say it. She talks a ton, takes what the couple says to her and then says it back to them in this way where it's like she's a LeBron-level basketball player, passing the ball to them, and then urging them down the court, running alongside, and shouting encouragement and instructions and very occasional razzing along the way. She's such an intense listener that it makes interviewing her a very odd experience. I tried to explain this to her after she and I had been sitting in the studio together for over an hour.
[1467.10 - 1474.91] IRA GLASS: I rarely am interviewing somebody-- I'm not sure if I've ever interviewed somebody who's watching me as much as I'm watching them.
[1474.91 - 1478.72] ESTHER PEREL: Yes, especially when your throat chokes.
[1478.72 - 1480.25] IRA GLASS: When my throat chokes? What does that mean?
[1480.25 - 1483.48] ESTHER PEREL: When I spoke and you would get--
[1483.48 - 1485.02] IRA GLASS: And what does that mean when I do that?
[1485.02 - 1489.30] ESTHER PEREL: When the little polyvagal nerve quivers, it means that I'm saying something that's reaching you.
[1489.30 - 1503.84] IRA GLASS: She's talking about the vagus nerve, which runs down your neck and into your body. Apparently, very revealing. The therapy session that I found so interesting, and all the sessions in her podcast, are a kind of session that Perel does a lot of.
[1503.84 - 1522.21] IRA GLASS: She does these consultations where instead of people coming in week after week, like normal therapy, a couple will come in just one time, for two or three hours. And then that's it. No more therapy. People fly in from all over for this. Perel only takes couples whose problems she thinks she can make a dent in in so little time.
[1522.21 - 1527.94] IRA GLASS: And what can you accomplish in a two or three-hour session, where you see the people once?
[1527.94 - 1536.18] ESTHER PEREL: So much. The story that the people come in with is not the story they leave with. That's the first goal.
[1536.18 - 1536.89] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[1536.89 - 1555.18] ESTHER PEREL: The second thing is to see if they can actually experience with each other, even a glimpse of it, that which they may be longing for. Can they have a different kind of connection, a different kind of experience of themselves and with each other in the room?
[1555.18 - 1559.82] IRA GLASS: And with most of the couples, can you get them to that point? That seems very advanced.
[1559.82 - 1564.71] ESTHER PEREL: Not necessarily. I mean, with many.
[1564.71 - 1582.77] IRA GLASS: It can make for suspenseful listening, hearing her try to get couples to that point. This particular couple came into her office on a Wednesday morning this fall and sat on the couch together. They'd been married for nearly 40 years, middle class people. They met when the woman was just 15. They have children and grandchildren.
[1582.77 - 1601.16] IRA GLASS: And then, three years ago, the wife discovered that her husband had been cheating on her. Not just like with one person for a few months or a few years, but widely and compulsively for most of their marriage. I mean, for decades. These were one-night stands and paying for sex, he said.
[1601.16 - 1620.76] IRA GLASS: They both said they'd been happy together all those years in the marriage with a good sex life, and she wanted to stay together if it was at all possible because she wanted to keep what they'd had that was good. But you know, being lied to for decades, it's like it robbed her of her past. She couldn't tell what was real, what to trust. She told Perel in the session.
[1620.76 - 1621.41] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[1621.41 - 1634.46] WOMAN: So yeah, I mean, we had a good marriage and that's why I'm still here. I mean, he was a good husband. He was the best father ever, always there with our children, always loving to me.
[1634.46 - 1655.35] WOMAN: And I don't doubt for one second that he didn't love me with all of his heart. I never knew anything was wrong. And I don't want to say I'm one of those women who lived in a tunnel without any peripheral vision.
[1655.35 - 1675.88] WOMAN: If something came up, I'd question him, and he'd tell me the story and I'd believe him. Why not believe him? He's never done anything to cause me to mistrust him. Now I look at him, and if he tells me this pen is red, I will turn it 15 different ways today. And that's a huge issue for us now.
[1675.88 - 1676.78] WOMAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[1676.78 - 1692.33] IRA GLASS: They spend a little bit of time in the session, not a lot, really, on what might have led him into this double life. He grew up in a violent home, saw his mother regularly beaten by his dad, was beaten himself, and witnessed way more than he could absorb or handle as a kid.
[1692.33 - 1710.87] IRA GLASS: Perel tells him there are lots of boys who go through that, and then grow up, split their personalities in half, like he'd done, treat women one way when they were away from home, and then be super responsible with their families when they are home. He seems kind of wrecked in the recording. It's only now that he was finally facing the truth about what he'd done and who he'd been.
[1710.87 - 1712.54] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[1712.54 - 1742.59] MAN: I've wasted 59 years living a mask, living a dual life. My kids didn't really know me. I was this other person. As much as I was involved with them, I wasn't present in my life. And I can't get that back. I wasted my life.
[1742.59 - 1742.98] MAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[1742.98 - 1750.11] IRA GLASS: He insisted he wasn't cheating because he was unhappy in his marriage. He said he was happy. He said he didn't love any of these women.
[1750.11 - 1764.76] IRA GLASS: And his wife was trying to believe him, that this was a compulsion that had nothing to do with her. But she was also struggling with the fact that her friends and relatives could not understand why she was staying with him after everything he'd done. They judged her, even her own daughter.
[1764.76 - 1765.06] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[1765.06 - 1766.46] ESTHER PEREL: And is she mad at you?
[1766.46 - 1768.82] WOMAN: Yeah, she was very mad at me.
[1768.82 - 1770.17] ESTHER PEREL: For not throwing him out?
[1770.17 - 1787.74] WOMAN: Well, I did throw him out, but for not ending it. Yeah, they thought I was weak. They thought I had Stockholm Syndrome. They felt I-- you know, because we've been together so long, they just felt that I was too weak in character. And they didn't like what they saw.
[1787.74 - 1788.20] WOMAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[1788.20 - 1795.44] IRA GLASS: Perel told me that it was seeing the wife's isolation that made her realize what it was that she wanted to accomplish in this session.
[1795.44 - 1821.72] ESTHER PEREL: She's decided to stay, and she needs a dignified way, a way with self-respect, to feel that her choice is valid. But in order for it to be valid, she needs something from him that I sense she has yet to receive, that he is struggling to give her. And it's that button that I choose to focus on during the session.
[1821.72 - 1823.83] IRA GLASS: And what is the thing that she needs from him?
[1823.83 - 1846.66] ESTHER PEREL: She needs a degree of accountability and recognition about the pain that he caused her. But now he's so busy with his own pain that he has a hard time owning the hurt that he caused her. So he feels so bad about himself, that he can't feel bad for her.
[1846.66 - 1872.33] IRA GLASS: So a lot of the session is Perel trying to get the husband to understand and acknowledge his wife's pain, and I'm going to play a stretch of this now that's several minutes long from the therapy session, starting from when Perel first brings this up. And what you hear is this very human thing I think all of us in relationships have done. He's not able to take in what they're saying to him at first. And it slowly, slowly gets through.
[1872.33 - 1880.60] IRA GLASS: Warning, if you're listening to the internet version of our show, we have unbeeped the curse words in this version. You can get a beeped version at our website.
[1880.60 - 1881.11] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[1881.11 - 1890.55] ESTHER PEREL: How much-- how much does he talk about what he did to you versus what happened to him?
[1890.55 - 1893.99] WOMAN: I would say he talks more about what happened to him--
[1893.99 - 1894.75] ESTHER PEREL: Correct.
[1894.75 - 1895.86] WOMAN: --than what happened to me.
[1895.86 - 1898.37] ESTHER PEREL: I'm sensing that. That is off balance.
[1898.37 - 1898.87] MAN: OK.
[1898.87 - 1908.30] ESTHER PEREL: So listen to her very carefully because I think she may have tried to say this already more than once.
[1908.30 - 1927.74] WOMAN: I really feel that you talk more about you and the pain you're going through than the horrific pain you caused me. All of your pain was self-inflicted. You made choices. You made decisions. You put yourself out there.
[1927.74 - 1944.94] WOMAN: But everything that was done to me is not something I asked for and not something I wanted to be party to. I mean, I know you know you hurt me, but I don't think you really get the magnitude. Because it always switches back to you.
[1944.94 - 1947.28] MAN: But the point of the whole story is--
[1947.28 - 1954.63] ESTHER PEREL: Before you but, can you just tell her what you just heard so that we can know that it reached you?
[1954.63 - 1981.78] MAN: That I'm not compassionate to your trauma and I talk more about my own trauma than your trauma. Does that pretty well sum it up? Talking about it just brings us both to such a bad place and all it does is bring out anger and hate from you every time I try to talk about this with you.
[1981.78 - 2010.10] ESTHER PEREL: So let me try to help you do this in a way that is more healing and less activating. Because you're in a certain phase. You've gone from the 59 years of trying to deny everything, numb myself, feel nothing, medicate, and now I'm in touch.
[2010.10 - 2025.74] ESTHER PEREL: I'm in touch with myself. I'm figuring it out. I'm putting the pieces together and it's making sense for the first time. There is no mask in front of me and I am so deep into myself. I'm so fricking self-absorbed!
[2025.74 - 2036.36] ESTHER PEREL: It's still more about me. It was about me then, and it is about me now. And now you gotta step out of yourself for a moment.
[2036.36 - 2058.04] ESTHER PEREL: If you attend to her primary concern, then she can attend to your primary trajectory. But she can only do that if there is space inside of her. And that space is created because you are saying to her, how are you doing? from a place of responsibility, not from a place of shame.
[2058.04 - 2060.39] MAN: I take responsibility.
[2060.39 - 2061.10] ESTHER PEREL: Yeah.
[2061.10 - 2065.40] MAN: Be very clear. I take 100%. There is no excuse. There were a couple of reasons.
[2065.40 - 2081.41] ESTHER PEREL: But the problem is that if you go to her and you say to her, I can't believe how I treated you, you have to be able to not say, I feel so bad about me for having done this. It's the difference between, I feel so bad about myself, versus I feel bad for you.
[2081.41 - 2084.61] MAN: That makes a lot of sense.
[2084.61 - 2096.57] ESTHER PEREL: And what she needs is for you to finally step out of yourself and actually be able to say, I feel so bad for you.
[2096.57 - 2110.11] WOMAN: I didn't do it to you. I didn't cause you all of this pain in your life, but you caused me all this pain in my life. You have to find a way to help me through it.
[2110.11 - 2114.26] MAN: I came to you last night. I hug you and you--
[2114.26 - 2115.88] WOMAN: And you have to let me say that.
[2115.88 - 2123.46] ESTHER PEREL: But people, you're going to help each other, help each other. You're going to learn that together.
[2123.46 - 2136.61] ESTHER PEREL: So when you get all upset that he has to, he has to, he doesn't know. He doesn't disagree, but he doesn't know. So you tell him what you want. Don't tell him what he has to or what he does wrong.
[2136.61 - 2144.38] MAN: I ask her that all the time. Tell me what you want, I'm there. I am all in. I am 100% all in.
[2144.38 - 2145.84] ESTHER PEREL: I believe you.
[2145.84 - 2160.43] MAN: I am self-absorbed. I got to get out of that. It's putting her before my own self needs. And it's important for me--
[2160.43 - 2166.94] ESTHER PEREL: It's beautiful. It's beautiful. But your wife is more isolated than you.
[2166.94 - 2168.22] MAN: OK.
[2168.22 - 2174.12] ESTHER PEREL: And she needs not an apology. She needs an acknowledgement of her experience.
[2174.12 - 2176.45] WOMAN: Yep.
[2176.45 - 2190.26] ESTHER PEREL: It's just that. You can use the words you want. You can use your body. Let it out.
[2190.26 - 2193.63] MAN: I love you.
[2193.63 - 2197.69] WOMAN: I know.
[2197.69 - 2199.81] MAN: I can't imagine what you're going through--
[2199.81 - 2201.47] MAN: [WOMAN SOBS]
[2201.47 - 2202.06] MAN: --but I'm here for you.
[2202.06 - 2215.18] ESTHER PEREL: That was good. Do you understand the difference?
[2215.18 - 2215.97] MAN: Yes, I do.
[2215.97 - 2216.24] MAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[2216.24 - 2219.94] IRA GLASS: So at that point, it seems like he's got it.
[2219.94 - 2244.67] ESTHER PEREL: You know, nobody ever apologized to him. He has no experience of someone saying, I'm so sorry I hurt you. So it's not something that he knows to do and that he just sobbed. And then for her, too.
[2244.67 - 2262.18] ESTHER PEREL: Because until now, see, when she would ask for this, she would also do it with so much venom and so much anger that it was very difficult for him to come close. It's like she would say, feel for me, but with such aggression sometimes. Sometimes, not--
[2262.18 - 2265.42] IRA GLASS: And to be fair, understandable. She's so hurt and she's so upset.
[2265.42 - 2266.22] ESTHER PEREL: Of course.
[2266.22 - 2267.14] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[2267.14 - 2277.70] ESTHER PEREL: It's a given. It's a given that she must have rage inside of her. But it's also a given that when she approaches him with that kind of rage, she won't get the kind of care and compassion that she wants.
[2277.70 - 2288.45] ESTHER PEREL: So how do I soften her so that he can soften? Because if she goes at him, then he will stay stiff. And if he stays stiff, then she will remain more angry and then you are in the same loop.
[2288.45 - 2289.32] IRA GLASS: Yeah, yeah.
[2289.32 - 2301.84] ESTHER PEREL: So I give words to what I know she's asking, but because I'm not experienced-- I don't have her history, I can do it without the edge. And when I can do it without the edge, then he can come forward.
[2301.84 - 2305.32] IRA GLASS: And then they can have this new experience with each other, which they haven't been having.
[2305.32 - 2310.54] ESTHER PEREL: That's the enactment that I'm talking about. I think she actually holds him at that moment.
[2310.54 - 2328.11] IRA GLASS: So you go through this with the two of them and they have this moment. And he truly seems to understand. And then the next thing that happens is the wife starts talking about her experience.
[2328.11 - 2340.17] IRA GLASS: And she says, the reason why she's able to continue staying with him is that she believes that the sex was casual, and that he didn't love anyone else. And then she talks about how she still questions, well, did he love her if he could do all that?
[2340.17 - 2341.04] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[2341.04 - 2346.01] WOMAN: I question how could you have really loved me if you did that to me? You know?
[2346.01 - 2346.41] WOMAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[2346.41 - 2348.88] IRA GLASS: And then she says this.
[2348.88 - 2349.31] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[2349.31 - 2359.12] WOMAN: You know, when we calculate in my head exactly how many years it was, 22 years. 22 years.
[2359.12 - 2368.93] WOMAN: We were married 36. You take away the two. You take away the 12. You cheated on me for 22 years. It's mind-boggling.
[2368.93 - 2370.26] MAN: I didn't cheat on her for 12 years.
[2370.26 - 2371.63] WOMAN: It's just mind-boggling.
[2371.63 - 2380.06] ESTHER PEREL: Mister, your wife has just said so many important things, and the only thing you respond to is the calculus?
[2380.06 - 2383.80] MAN: We go through this all the time. It's the calculus.
[2383.80 - 2386.93] ESTHER PEREL: You have to respond differently than what you just did.
[2386.93 - 2387.46] ESTHER PEREL: [END PLAYBACK]
[2387.46 - 2395.94] IRA GLASS: It's like he's lost the lesson, and he's talking about himself. He's defending himself. He's not talking about what she's feeling.
[2395.94 - 2417.58] ESTHER PEREL: Well, I'm going to show it to him again. This has to be repeated. But I actually have a different experience of him. She just said 22 years, and he receives this like, what a piece of shit I am. And it's so unbearable.
[2417.58 - 2429.03] ESTHER PEREL: And so then he brings out the 12 years to say, I'm not that bad. That's the calculus. So now I'm going to help him stay with her.
[2429.03 - 2429.56] ESTHER PEREL: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[2429.56 - 2434.55] ESTHER PEREL: You know you have to respond differently than what you just did. You can do better.
[2434.55 - 2448.80] MAN: Yeah. Yeah. It was a horrible-- it's a horrible thing that you had to go through there. You're my family, and as crazy as it sounds, how can I do this to my family?
[2448.80 - 2449.73] MAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[2449.73 - 2464.05] IRA GLASS: And then he stumbles again. He tries to reassure his wife that there is no way he's ever going to cheat on her again. And then he starts talking about the lessons that he has learned and how certain it is that he's changed. In other words, he's talking about himself. And Perel steps in again.
[2464.05 - 2464.81] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[2464.81 - 2465.99] MAN: And I'm trying to tell you--
[2465.99 - 2470.62] ESTHER PEREL: You know what may be more helpful? Don't try to convince her.
[2470.62 - 2472.92] MAN: OK.
[2472.92 - 2494.73] ESTHER PEREL: Because you can't be that certain either. And most of the time, talk less and touch more. Talk less. You overtalk. So when she gets upset, half the time, all you need to do is hold her and just say I'm here. And for the rest, if you allow me, shut the fuck up.
[2494.73 - 2495.25] ESTHER PEREL: [CHUCKLING]
[2495.25 - 2495.93] MAN: Good advice.
[2495.93 - 2498.20] MAN: [END PLAYBACK]
[2498.20 - 2508.07] IRA GLASS: It's interesting. There this idea that when you talk through your problems with your partner, it will alleviate loneliness. But here they are, talking, and it's just doing the opposite.
[2508.07 - 2516.62] ESTHER PEREL: Yes, you can build walls with words and insurmountable barriers.
[2516.62 - 2534.65] IRA GLASS: Hearing your podcast, it seems so hard for people to come together. I was wondering if, in your line of work, if it makes you feel hopeful for most couples, and hopeful for the idea of people finding what they want with their partners?
[2534.65 - 2569.56] ESTHER PEREL: You know, the thing that just popped in my head is I have days where I have faith in humanity and days when I don't. I'll answer you from a different angle. I once wanted to write an article on couples that inspire. And I asked about 60, 70 people, at the time, if they knew of couples that inspired them. And the vast majority could sometimes come up with one.
[2569.56 - 2571.34] IRA GLASS: Wow.
[2571.34 - 2588.92] ESTHER PEREL: I never wrote the piece, but it's the answer to your question, right? It's that we can see some couples who are very good at this and some couples who are very good at that, but we don't have that many models where we just say, wow, this is who I want to be, how I want to be.
