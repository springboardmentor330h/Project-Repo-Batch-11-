[0.30 - 23.02] IRA GLASS: In New York, like in lots of cities, you can call 311 for help with city services, but also for all kinds of other stuff. The most common calls they get are about landlords not heating apartments properly, but they'll also help you get hold of a W-2 form you need from 2009, tell you what streets will be blocked off for a presidential visit, connect you with the gas company, and a stunning array of other things. 50,000 calls a day.
[23.02 - 24.65] VICTORIA DUSINI: Actually, I had a call today.
[24.65 - 27.18] IRA GLASS: This is 311 operator Victoria Dusini.
[27.18 - 42.35] VICTORIA DUSINI: The woman said that her fiancee died in their bed and that she was pregnant. And she wanted to identify his DNA in order to get Social Security benefits. So she wanted to know who to contact.
[42.35 - 54.38] IRA GLASS: She got a referral to family court, which can establish paternity, to the Social Security office, to find out how to get the benefits, and a legal referral to the New York City Bar Association. Here's 311 operator Angelique Pantoja.
[54.38 - 67.03] ANGELIQUE PANTOJA: Well, a woman who was cleaning her garage, and she moved a box, and there was a crocodile. And so I had to ask her, like a crocodile from-- like big, with the-- and she's like, yeah, it's going snap, snap at me.
[67.03 - 73.08] IRA GLASS: She says that was an easy one, of course-- call Animal Care and Control. But she also helped with this call.
[73.08 - 86.58] ANGELIQUE PANTOJA: I had a woman who was-- I guess she had an unruly teenager. And she-- even on the phone they were arguing. And she just-- she couldn't take it. She couldn't take the disrespect, and she wanted help.
[86.58 - 106.29] IRA GLASS: That woman was given a referral for counseling services. The way all this works is that the operators sit at computers with a massive database of answers-- thousands of different topics. They can help you locate where your car was towed. They can explain the changes in your property tax. They can help you find something you left in a New York City taxi, which, by the way, they can do even without the cab number now that taxis have GPS.
[106.29 - 119.85] IRA GLASS: But lots of people call for things that are not in the database. You see a UFO? 311 has no answers for you. Not in the database. You drop your keys in the sewer grate at the corner? New York City is not going to help you with that one either.
[119.85 - 151.49] IRA GLASS: And people call with all kinds of stuff. I know a guy, he and his wife were in a taxicab, riding home late at night from a Halloween party. He was dressed as a Teletubby. She was a sexy creature from the deep sea-- fishnet stocking, short skirt, fake seaweed. They got to their apartment. It's late at night. His wife told him, get out. She would continue in the cab-- she wanted to spend the night elsewhere. So he got out of the cab. And, not sure exactly what to do, he dialed 311.
[151.49 - 170.46] IRA GLASS: Operator picks up. He says, I don't know where my wife is. The operator asked, is she missing? He could be connected to the police. No, no, the guy says. And at that point, he realizes-- right, she's been staying out a lot. Right, she's having an affair.
[170.46 - 181.93] IRA GLASS: He didn't know exactly what it was that he wanted to get from 311. It's just he found himself suddenly not sure what had happened to him or how he got there. He had never been in this situation. It wasn't clear what to do.
[181.93 - 191.39] NATASHIA TOWNSEND: We get those types of calls because we are known for a place that gives answers. So I guess, why not try 311?
[191.39 - 193.54] IRA GLASS: 311 operator Natashia Townsend.
[193.54 - 219.55] NATASHIA TOWNSEND: I've had a caller-- she called to speak about her boyfriend. She felt like her boyfriend was going to leave her, because he was a model, and she just felt like he had a lot of attention from other women. So I would try to offer her different services, maybe some counseling for their relationship, and she didn't want it. She just wanted to speak to a 311 rep.
[219.55 - 230.20] NATASHIA TOWNSEND: She's like, no, I don't want to speak to anyone else. I just want to speak to 311. And there's nothing in our database that we use to say, OK, well, if he's doing this, this is what you should do.
[230.20 - 250.44] IRA GLASS: Natashia found herself off the grid, so she improvised. She's not allowed to give personal advice, which she told the woman. So she basically said the only thing she could say in this situation that they did not train her for-- I understand. She said, I understand, over and over. The woman kept her on the phone for 45 minutes, and it seemed to help.
[250.44 - 253.35] NATASHIA TOWNSEND: I think she felt better after she got off the phone.
[253.35 - 254.56] IRA GLASS: How do you know?
[254.56 - 267.70] NATASHIA TOWNSEND: She said thank you. She said, thank you for listening to me. That's really what it was. She really just wanted to talk.
[267.70 - 302.42] IRA GLASS: Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, what happens when you find yourself off the map, far from all the normal things you're used to and that you do, and things are way, way more extreme than they were for this 311 operator. You are lost in some situation you've never been in and you've never heard of anybody else in either, and you have to improvise, which either brings out a resourceful, heroic side of people or just the opposite. Stay with us.
[302.42 - 319.80] IRA GLASS: Act One, Marriage of Inconvenience. This first story is about a couple who are in a relationship that is unlike the homes that either of them grew up in. Unlike, actually, anything in either of their experiences. They're married, and it's a prison marriage. It's the guy who's the prisoner, and he was a prisoner when they met.
[319.80 - 334.96] IRA GLASS: If you're listening to our program on the podcast or on the internet, I just want to give you a heads up-- there's cursing in here that we have not beeped. If you prefer a beeped version of our program, you can hear that at our website, thisamericanlife.org. Christopher Rhodes tells the story.
[334.96 - 351.19] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Prison marriages aren't so unusual. They happen. Michael Jewell was serving out a life sentence for murder in Texas. Joan Covici was a widow living in Dallas who volunteered with the ACLU. They never thought that Michael would get out, and they were OK with that.
[351.19 - 373.48] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: But sometimes they'd talk about what it would be like if he were released-- to spend time together at her summer cabin in New Hampshire, go fishing together, be married for real. And five years into their relationship, when Michael decided to appeal his case, in the very unlikely event that he'd win, Joan wanted to be prepared. So she drew up a contract.
[373.48 - 390.29] JOAN COVICI: We made kind of a pact that we-- and I still have that document-- that we would try it for two years. Whenever he got out, we would try it for two years. And if we weren't happy after two years, that we would separate.
[390.29 - 394.68] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Joan keeps the contract in her desk at home.
[394.68 - 398.19] JOAN COVICI: "We, the undersigned, agree to the following arrangements, following--"
[398.19 - 421.21] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: The contract explicitly lays out all the very practical things that usually go unspoken in a relationship. Joan agrees that she'll provide Michael with a place to live and money for food and clothes. Michael agrees to take care of Joan, to be her companion. The contract is like a couple's fantasy of the most ordinary details of everyday life together. It gets amazingly specific. Here are some of Michael's duties.
[421.21 - 448.79] JOAN COVICI: "House chores-- 50% participation in cooking, cleaning, trash takeout, bed making, and minor household repairs. Outside chores-- yard and garden maintenance, dog walking, shopping, driving, and car and air travel assistance. Here follows some specific obligations for Joan. House chores-- 50% participation in cooking, cleaning, bed making, and laundry, providing--"
[448.79 - 471.95] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Without prison, it's unlikely that Michael and Joan would have ever met in the first place. She's 16 years older than he is, from a completely different world. Michael never knew much more than crime. When he was about seven, his father had him steal a pair of shoes. Things went downhill from there. Michael robbed grocery stores, cracked safes. He was in and out of prison. Then in 1970, he killed a man during a robbery.
[471.95 - 490.95] MICHAEL JEWELL: We spooked him, you know? We scared the hell out of him. And the wind was howling, and I was standing in front of him, trying to tell him, this is a robbery. Cooperate, and you won't get hurt. And he said, oh, oh, and made a motion like Matt Dillon going for the draw.
[490.95 - 515.55] MICHAEL JEWELL: And my partner thought he was going for a pistol and shot him in the back. And when I heard the shot, just reflexively, I shot him in the chest. And when he hit the ground, I knelt down and searched him, and he didn't even have a weapon. What he was trying to do was give us the bank sack.
[515.55 - 526.10] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael was caught and convicted, which in Texas means he wound up on death row. He was 23.
[526.10 - 548.82] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Joan's life in her early 20s was about as far from rural Texas as you can get in this country. She lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was married to a PhD student in English literature at Harvard named Pascal Covici, Jr. Pascal's father was the editor and lifelong friend of John Steinbeck, which meant that sometimes Joan got to go to intimate parties in New York City full of literary heavyweights.
[548.82 - 554.48] JOAN COVICI: Saul was often there, Saul Bellow. And Arthur.
[554.48 - 555.70] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Arthur Miller?
[555.70 - 566.74] JOAN COVICI: Arthur Miller. When Arthur married Marilyn, of course, then everybody wanted to go to the dinner party.
[566.74 - 569.21] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Marilyn, of course, was Marilyn Monroe.
[569.21 - 604.92] JOAN COVICI: She was quiet, didn't talk a whole lot. But she was so gorgeous, we all just sat there and looked at her and were happy that she was there. The men did most of the talking. And I was also quiet at those parties, too. I didn't feel as comfortable. They were often talking about things that were not familiar to me-- about their work and politics. So I had the baby by then, and that was taking up most of my attention.
[604.92 - 619.55] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Joan's marriage to Pascal was pretty standard for the time. He was the breadwinner, she was the homemaker. Joan raised two kids, eventually became a schoolteacher. And then, many years later, when Joan was 66, Pascal died of cancer.
[619.55 - 640.41] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: After his death, she got more involved with volunteer work she'd been doing at the local ACLU chapter. She answered prison mail and started corresponding with several inmates to find out about conditions in the Texas prison system. Which is how she first met Michael. He was 52, nearly 30 years into his prison sentence. And he sent a letter that found its way to Joan.
[640.41 - 650.34] MICHAEL JEWELL: It says, "Dear friends, I am a prisoner on the Eastham Unit of the Texas prison system. I came to prison with the death penalty in 1970. I stayed on death row--"
[650.34 - 677.84] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: There was nothing special about Michael's letter. He was asking about getting involved with anti-death penalty work. His own death sentence had been commuted to life in 1973, and he'd become something of an activist in prison, heavily involved in prison reform issues. Joan read his letter and dutifully wrote back. Then Michael wrote back, then Joan wrote, and so on. Michael and Joan wrote to each other almost every single day for 10 years.
[677.84 - 700.40] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael was self-taught, but his letters showed how much he'd read, including most of John Steinbeck. And his intellect impressed Joan. She was constantly communicating with prisoners, five to 10 at a time, but Michael's letter stood out. He was a good writer. Take this letter he wrote to Joan after he intentionally injured himself, cut his own Achilles tendon, to protest work duty conditions.
[700.40 - 729.73] MICHAEL JEWELL: "I had grown to love my body without narcissism, almost as a free and a faithful companion. It was, after all, my only refuge from the filth and the stench and the scorn. As I sat there, contemplating the harsh task at hand, I felt like a traitor, as though I were committing the highest treason. It was most difficult to see a higher--"
[729.73 - 743.29] JOAN COVICI: He looked-- to me, he looked like James Cagney. He just was a perfect James Cagney. Except that he didn't have very good teeth. He had just a few teeth on the bottom.
[743.29 - 769.31] JOAN COVICI: So I saw him, and he was James Cagney, and I used to love James Cagney and his movies. But again, it was not-- it wasn't love at first sight or anything like that, because I'm not that sort of person. I go for the mind first. And he had a wonderful mind. And we just had lots to talk about.
[769.31 - 777.76] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: It wasn't all intellectual. In his letters, Michael started using pet names for Joan. He'd call her Sweet Baby Joan. And other things too.
[777.76 - 790.51] MICHAEL JEWELL: "Dear noble little squaw, sweet baby." "Dearest finger licking good, sweet baby." "Dear honey butt." [LAUGHS]
[790.51 - 793.42] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: In her letters, Joan loosened up as well.
[793.42 - 811.55] JOAN COVICI: "I think I'll fix a big scotch and go sit in the backyard and smoke a cigarette and try to get you into perspective. God, I wish you were here to spank." (LAUGHING) Can I stop there?
[811.55 - 835.45] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Every Sunday afternoon, Joan would drive a few hours to visit Michael in prison, a book on tape playing on the car stereo. She'd stay at the same fancy bed and breakfast near the prison, became friends with the people who ran the place. And then the rest of the week, she got to go back to her own life and did what she wanted to do. It was romance, but on her terms, something she'd never experienced.
[835.45 - 848.06] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael and Joan would hug and kiss discreetly on their contact visits. This was all in a public visiting room. There was nothing conjugal about what was going on. The limits of their time together were clear, and Joan was happy with the arrangement.
[848.06 - 861.92] JOAN COVICI: I kind of liked being alone. It's very comfortable for a woman to know that somebody loves her and yet she has all this freedom to live her own life.
[861.92 - 875.98] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael and Joan knew that no matter how close they became, they'd never really be together. Rarely, if ever, does a former death row inmate get paroled in Texas. So, really, what they had was their letters. Here's another one from Joan.
[875.98 - 885.19] JOAN COVICI: "A song that has always torn my heart is the 'September Song.' You remember-- 'And these few precious days I'll spend with you.'"
[885.19 - 888.65] JOAN COVICI: [MUSIC - "SEPTEMBER SONG" BY WILLIE NELSON]
[888.65 - 891.95] JOAN COVICI: nan
[891.95 - 910.00] JOAN COVICI: "And especially in our case, the days are few, and we may never spend them really together. We must get used to this reality and not ruin what years remain. I love you, precious Michael. SBJ." Sweet Baby Joan.
[910.00 - 913.24] JOAN COVICI: [MUSIC - "SEPTEMBER SONG" BY WILLIE NELSON]
[913.24 - 923.87] JOAN COVICI: nan
[923.87 - 944.82] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: In 2005, they got married. But that was mainly so that they wouldn't lose their visitation rights. The prison had denied them visits before. And they lived this way, happily, for five years. Then, in June 2010, Michael was summoned by prison authorities. He walked into a room, and an official came to speak to him.
[944.82 - 956.44] MICHAEL JEWELL: He said, are you Jewell? I said, yeah. He said, here, I got a present for you. And he handed me a sheet of paper. And I started reading it, and I had made parole.
[956.44 - 964.43] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael was confused. Just a month or so before, he'd gone before the parole board and been denied, just as he had been many times before.
[964.43 - 982.84] MICHAEL JEWELL: I think I stopped breathing for about two or three minutes. I didn't really-- I was kind of-- my first reaction was, this has got to be a fucking mistake, you know? It was unheard of, you know? Something like that happens once every 10 years in prison to somebody.
[982.84 - 996.25] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael has no real idea why he was paroled. He thinks it might have had something to do with a lawsuit he filed against the prison system, saying that it was understaffed and unsafe. Releasing Michael made the lawsuit go away.
[996.25 - 1008.55] JOAN COVICI: I think it was a surprise to both of us when he suddenly was put on the street. He was scared at the thought of coming out. He wasn't prepared for it. Neither one of us was, really.
[1008.55 - 1032.77] JOAN COVICI: You know, I wanted him home, and I knew it was going to be hard. I knew it was going to be difficult. And I knew that the chances of the relationship lasting were very bad. But I had agreed to try it, and so--
[1032.77 - 1046.03] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Do you think that you would have gotten into the relationship as you did, and to the degree that you did, if you knew that he was actually going to get out one day?
[1046.03 - 1050.03] JOAN COVICI: I can't answer that. I really don't know.
[1050.03 - 1087.68] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Now with Michael about to be released, the contract we talked about at the beginning of this story, the one that laid out all the shared household and relationship duties should Michael, a convicted murderer, ever get paroled, that contract was about to be put into effect. The contract stipulated a two-year trial period for their marriage. If it turned into a real marriage, fine. If it didn't, they would go their separate ways. Joan could fire Michael, or he could quit-- those are their words-- at any time. Nobody keeps statistics on how long prison marriages last on the outside, but lots of prison people will tell you most end before a year is up.
[1087.68 - 1117.66] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: On August 21, 2010, after 40 years in prison, and 10 years with Joan, Michael was a free man. Joan was waiting for him in a parked car at the prison gates, wearing an earring Michael had made for her. Joan was so nervous and excited that she hadn't slept the night before. She had a whole romantic vision for the day. She had made a reservation at a five-star hotel. Michael walked out wearing his prison-issued jumpsuit, nervous, and overwhelmed to be out.
[1117.66 - 1130.15] JOAN COVICI: And he didn't kiss me or anything. He just got into the car and said, let's go. So it was a very unromantic meeting, and it was-- it kind of hurt me.
[1130.15 - 1138.66] MICHAEL JEWELL: You know, I was elated, but I was kind of bewildered. I don't think you can describe it.
[1138.66 - 1156.12] JOAN COVICI: I thought he would be as warm to see me as he was in the visiting room, so he would hug me and try to steal an extra kiss or something. Oh no, he was very businesslike. It wasn't what they show in the movies at all.
[1156.12 - 1174.31] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: As comprehensive as the contract was, it didn't cover everything. It didn't occur to them to include anything about sex. A quick warning to anyone listening with kids-- this next bit of the story is about that. Michael had never had sex with someone he loved, and 40 years in prison left him pretty messed up on that subject.
[1174.31 - 1192.42] JOAN COVICI: I did not expect him to be so afraid to cuddle. If we have our clothes on, he hugs me all day long. But getting naked with somebody makes him very uncomfortable.
[1192.42 - 1217.70] MICHAEL JEWELL: Especially the last few years, she had taken on more and more of a mother figure to me, you know? And when I actually-- when we got in a hotel room together, then I started pacing the floor, identifying with Oedipus Rex, if you know what I mean.
[1217.70 - 1243.62] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: I think what he means is their relationship had shifted over the years. And she was now 79, remember, 16 years older than Michael. Once they were in a hotel room, they realized that the nature of their feelings toward each other were really complicated. Over the years they'd known each other, Joan had gone from initially feeling like she wanted to adopt Michael to wanting to sleep with him, to now that he was out, a kind of mishmash of all those feelings.
[1243.62 - 1263.77] JOAN COVICI: He's still an adopted child, and he's still my best companion. And I love him, and he's my best friend. So it's all together, and I'm comfortable with it.
[1263.77 - 1279.23] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: So Michael moved into Joan's suburban ranch house in Dallas and got to know her family and friends. There were lots of academics, all sorts of people and settings he'd never encountered before. She was surprised how well he did socially, but they had their rocky moments.
[1279.23 - 1308.45] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Joan took Michael to a wine tasting party, and he got fall down drunk. Joan had to haul him outside to avoid making a scene. This happened two or three times. He never really drank socially before, usually just to get hammered. And at parties with Joan, he'd go too far, partly to calm his nerves. One of Joan's friends, someone who'd been close to Joan's first husband, Pascal, was appalled by her choice of a second husband and ended their friendship.
[1308.45 - 1312.57] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: As much of a hassle as Michael was, Joan came to rely on him.
[1312.57 - 1313.81] MICHAEL JEWELL: Come on, sweet.
[1313.81 - 1314.25] JOAN COVICI: OK.
[1314.25 - 1317.52] NAN: MICHAEL JEWELL: No wait, why don't you get-- let me get in front, and you hold my shoulders.
[1317.52 - 1318.51] JOAN COVICI: All right.
[1318.51 - 1337.74] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: I know this tape is a little hard to hear, but one night when I was with Joan and Michael, we came back to their house after attending a meeting on prison reform, and Joan had lost her keys. It was dark out, and Michael said to her, let me get in front. You hold my shoulders. Joan is 83 years old now. Michael is 67.
[1337.74 - 1348.78] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Michael guided Joan through the darkness around the side of the house. The only way they could get in was for Michael to reach up through the doggy door and unlock the handle. It was clear they'd done this before.
[1348.78 - 1350.27] JOAN COVICI: Well, you have to punch it in.
[1350.27 - 1354.26] MICHAEL JEWELL: I will, if I have to.
[1354.26 - 1363.20] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: In a way, the biggest thing about having Michael here, Joan says, is having someone around the house. She missed having a companion.
[1363.20 - 1365.56] MICHAEL JEWELL: No-- oh, look at there, you got it, Joanie.
[1365.56 - 1371.87] JOAN COVICI: See? I told you.
[1371.87 - 1394.38] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: It's now been four years since Michael got out. They've made it way past the trial period in their contract. Michael still leaves the stove on and the front door open, things he never had to think about when he was in prison. He leaves his stuff lying around everywhere. Joan says it's like having a teenager in the house again. But they've learned to deal with all this. Their lives are intertwined now.
[1394.38 - 1435.43] JOAN COVICI: Somehow there's an equality of people in this marriage that I didn't have before. I was too dependent upon my husband and his reputation. But with Michael, it's just it's-- you know, I figure I've become free in some strange way. The neighbors have to accept us the way we are now. They got a criminal in their neighborhood. And I love to have him out there with all of his tats all over him.
[1435.43 - 1446.38] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Now that Joan is in her early 80s, she's started to wonder what's going to happen to Michael when she's gone. That wasn't in the contract. Joan figures maybe they've got another seven years together.
[1446.38 - 1449.63] JOAN COVICI: We'll have to find you another old lady to take you in.
[1449.63 - 1454.75] MICHAEL JEWELL: [LAUGHS] Prospects are going to be few and far between.
[1454.75 - 1459.91] JOAN COVICI: I'll find another kindergarten teacher who will really shape you up.
[1459.91 - 1472.67] MICHAEL JEWELL: Well, we often say that we should die together. So maybe we'll drive into a freight train or get hit by an 18-wheeler.
[1472.67 - 1476.60] JOAN COVICI: [LAUGHS] Well, what about a plane crash? Don't you like that idea?
[1476.60 - 1477.12] MICHAEL JEWELL: No.
[1477.12 - 1478.40] JOAN COVICI: Oh, no, not that?
[1478.40 - 1479.50] MICHAEL JEWELL: No, I'd rather drown.
[1479.50 - 1488.60] JOAN COVICI: Oh. (LAUGHING) I see.
[1488.60 - 1513.42] CHRISTOPHER RHODES: Until that day, whether they go out together or not, they like to watch Downton Abbey together. They go to plays. Recently they went to see a Tennessee Williams play at a community theater near their house. And these two people, who have lived very different lives, had the same reaction. They thought the play sucked. They left at intermission.
[1513.42 - 1531.88] IRA GLASS: Christopher Rhodes. Coming up, Brother, Can You Spare a Lime? Siblings on a road trip through Mexico that is unlike anything that either one of them imagined beforehand. Also, comedian Tig Notaro. That is in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.
[1531.88 - 1553.51] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme and bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, "Wait-- Do You Have the Map?" Stories of people in situations they have no preparation for whatsoever, because most people have not been in those situations. In the second half of our program, both stories take place where you need a map-- that is, on the road.
[1553.51 - 1585.60] IRA GLASS: We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, Final Rest Stop. Tig Notaro is a comedian who's been on this show before. Last year, she went on a tour across the country that was filmed. It was a strange tour. She and this Canadian comic named Jon Dore went around the country performing in people's living rooms and backyards, lots of situations they just had to ad hoc their way through. One of our producers, Nancy Updike, saw an advance copy of the film, which has many, many moments in it that fit today's theme. Here's Nancy.
[1585.60 - 1610.39] NANCY UPDIKE: Tig and Jon are like door-to-door comedy salesmen in the film-- invited salesmen-- showing up at people's houses and knocking on their doors. But my favorite parts of the movie are just Tig and Jon in the car in between gigs-- the road trip part of the movie. Jon's always driving, sometimes using special Canadian mind exercises to either stay alert or to annoy Tig.
[1610.39 - 1611.75] JON DORE: I'm going to name as many--
[1611.75 - 1612.54] TIG NOTARO: No, no, no, no.
[1612.54 - 1613.95] JON DORE: --Montreal Expos--
[1613.95 - 1614.49] TIG NOTARO: No, no, no.
[1614.49 - 1620.77] JON DORE: --as I can. Andres Galarraga. Tim Wallach. Tim Raines.
[1620.77 - 1630.83] NANCY UPDIKE: They talk in the car, riff on each other's jokes. It's like watching dancers staying limber between performances. Tig shows off her incredible impression of a clown's horn.
[1630.83 - 1632.77] TIG NOTARO: [HONKING]
[1632.77 - 1633.73] JON DORE: That's really good.
[1633.73 - 1634.86] TIG NOTARO: [HONK]
[1634.86 - 1646.85] NANCY UPDIKE: They both look like they're having a really good time. Then as Jon is wrapping up his impression of Johnny Carson auditioning for Jodie Foster's role in Silence of the Lambs, Tig suddenly grimaces in pain.
[1646.85 - 1647.81] TIG NOTARO: Ow.
[1647.81 - 1648.78] JON DORE: What happened?
[1648.78 - 1650.50] TIG NOTARO: I just get stomach pains.
[1650.50 - 1653.11] JON DORE: Is this something I need to be worried about, or is this just, like, your stomach aches?
[1653.11 - 1654.36] TIG NOTARO: No, nothing to be worried about.
[1654.36 - 1654.77] JON DORE: Do you need to take a moment?
[1654.77 - 1657.94] TIG NOTARO: If it continued for a while, then there would be trouble.
[1657.94 - 1673.78] NANCY UPDIKE: Tig had cancer two years ago-- famously, if you follow comedy. It was breast cancer, advanced. She had a double mastectomy. A few months before the cancer was diagnosed, Tig was in the hospital with a terrible, sometimes deadly, infection called C. diff.
[1673.78 - 1689.23] NANCY UPDIKE: Over the course of the tour, driving around, doing gigs, Tig and Jon log enough hours together that they get into all of that-- illness, fear of death. They joke about it. They're serious about it. They navigate it.
[1689.23 - 1720.45] NANCY UPDIKE: And at some point in the trip, Jon and Tig pull over at a roadside store that sells fireworks and tombstones. Maybe two different people on a different road trip wouldn't have stopped, or wouldn't have stayed if they stopped. But as friends who were also comics, they both head into the field of tombstones and start improvising-- neither of them knowing where this is going to lead and whether it's going to be funny or maybe a terrible idea.
[1720.45 - 1721.62] JON DORE: Hey, let's get you a headstone.
[1721.62 - 1723.78] TIG NOTARO: Yeah, let's get me a headstone.
[1723.78 - 1728.44] NANCY UPDIKE: Tig explains to the owner of the store why she and Jon are looking for a headstone for her.
[1728.44 - 1731.49] TIG NOTARO: I've had some health issues lately.
[1731.49 - 1732.78] MAN: Oh.
[1732.78 - 1739.75] TIG NOTARO: I just want to be smart, think ahead. All right.
[1739.75 - 1740.37] JON DORE: Wow.
[1740.37 - 1742.55] TIG NOTARO: So this one's $250?
[1742.55 - 1744.02] MAN: Yeah.
[1744.02 - 1745.70] TIG NOTARO: I really like this one.
[1745.70 - 1749.07] NANCY UPDIKE: Tig at this point is touching a modest, flat slab on the ground.
[1749.07 - 1753.46] JON DORE: See, now that's just the bottom. You could have that engraved, right, and just use that.
[1753.46 - 1754.06] MAN: Yeah.
[1754.06 - 1754.94] NANCY UPDIKE: That's the owner.
[1754.94 - 1760.77] JON DORE: But you would want-- I would buy you this. I would love to buy your headstone.
[1760.77 - 1768.22] NANCY UPDIKE: Jon's pointing to an upright headstone. Tig seems momentarily thrown, like, are we still playing here?
[1768.22 - 1768.74] TIG NOTARO: All right.
[1768.74 - 1771.24] JON DORE: I'm not joking. I would love to do this for you.
[1771.24 - 1771.68] TIG NOTARO: OK.
[1771.68 - 1773.89] JON DORE: I'd buy your headstone if you buy the base.
[1773.89 - 1777.28] TIG NOTARO: All right. Because I'm more than happy to just have that.
[1777.28 - 1779.39] JON DORE: You should have this, don't you think?
[1779.39 - 1779.85] TIG NOTARO: OK.
[1779.85 - 1781.80] JON DORE: What is that without this?
[1781.80 - 1782.56] TIG NOTARO: That is a base.
[1782.56 - 1784.69] JON DORE: Yeah, but what are you going to do with a base?
[1784.69 - 1787.54] TIG NOTARO: I'm going to go under it.
[1787.54 - 1788.49] JON DORE: You should have this.
[1788.49 - 1797.20] NANCY UPDIKE: Let me stop the tape. That pause-- that's Jon's moment to be stunned by the directness of, "I'm going to go under it." Then he recovers.
[1797.20 - 1812.75] JON DORE: You should have this. People are not going to want to stand over it and read. They're going to want to look at it from a distance. Look it, if you get something like this, people can sit down in front of it and cry. So you're underneath me, right? And I'm just bawling my eyes out, and I can read it here. I don't have to kneel down and come all the way over there.
[1812.75 - 1813.14] TIG NOTARO: Yeah.
[1813.14 - 1814.51] JON DORE: I can bring a lawn chair. If you--
[1814.51 - 1816.70] TIG NOTARO: I guess this is hard on the back.
[1816.70 - 1816.97] JON DORE: Yeah.
[1816.97 - 1818.17] TIG NOTARO: To do this.
[1818.17 - 1820.68] JON DORE: I'd be in a lawn chair. I'd be there for hours.
[1820.68 - 1823.62] TIG NOTARO: You'd spend some time.
[1823.62 - 1826.68] JON DORE: You'd look beautiful under that.
[1826.68 - 1831.37] TIG NOTARO: I like it. I like it.
[1831.37 - 1841.73] NANCY UPDIKE: Jon buys the headstone. It's $425. Cheap for a tombstone, expensive for a joke. Then they get back on the road.
[1841.73 - 1859.54] NANCY UPDIKE: I watched this scene a bunch of times, the way they pushed the joke forward but kept saying real things with real feelings. It was a game, and the game was, keep it going. Don't stop. Let's see where this goes.

[3536.92 - 3549.95] IRA GLASS: Thanks, as always, to our program's co-founder, Mr. Torey Malatia. You know, he told me the first time he went to a board meeting-- a real board meeting-- at WBEZ, he was totally disappointed. He thought there was going to be milk and cookies and all the candy you could eat.
[3549.95 - 3555.84] JOAN COVICI: It was very businesslike. It wasn't what they show in the movies at all.
[3555.84 - 3559.51] IRA GLASS: I'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.
