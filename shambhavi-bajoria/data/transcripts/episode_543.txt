[0.53 - 21.65] IRA GLASS: Someone who works with our radio show, Bianca Giaever, went to this presentation at Columbia University a while back where two people onstage puzzled over this thing they had found online called Wake Up Now. And I say "thing they found online," because the whole point of their presentation was it was hard to tell exactly what it was.
[21.65 - 35.90] WOMAN: Why do some people live their lives in black and white while others seem to live in vibrant color? Well, part of it is knowing a secret, a secret that changes how people see the world. This video is your invitation to WakeUpNow.
[35.90 - 55.22] IRA GLASS: This is a video that was on WakeUpNow's website, which just looked like a kind of generic corporate-y website. And WakeUpNow seemed to be a company. But it was hard to tell exactly what the company did. This site talked about joining, about becoming a member, about living a better life. So was it a club? Was it an organization?
[55.22 - 71.72] IRA GLASS: And then, when you googled WakeUpNow, there were tons of videos. Bianca saw some at the presentation at Columbia. And then, after the presentation, she started Googling on her own. And then, she sucked one of our producers, Brian Reed, into the vortex with her. Here is one of the videos they found.
[71.72 - 78.77] MAN 1: Hey, we're here in Cancun with the greatest team in the world, WakeUpNow. You should have been here. All the leaders are here. We're having fun. Beautiful island.
[78.77 - 95.69] IRA GLASS: This is a video of a bunch of young people hanging out on the beach. You can see jet skis and the ocean. In the video, they refer to this as a leadership summit. And there was a whole genre of videos just like this, people in exotic locations, riding around in nice looking cars or, in this one, spelunking in a cave in Mexico, chanting.
[95.69 - 97.60] IRA GLASS: [MUSIC - "LA BAMBA"]
[97.60 - 101.43] IRA GLASS: nan
[101.43 - 129.80] IRA GLASS: That is, of course, WakeUpNow with "La Bamba." And then, there were a lot of videos with the word "scam" in the title, like "WakeUpNow is a scam, for real exposed truth." And so, these two producers on our staff were like, oh, so this is some kind of internet scam. But then, when they watched the videos, it seemed very different. Like, take this one for example titled, "WakeUpNow Warning, Don't Join Until You See This."
[129.80 - 135.74] MAN 2: WakeUpNow is one of the most legitimate companies out there. The reason why is because--
[135.74 - 156.36] IRA GLASS: So "WakeUpNow Warning, Don't Join Till You See This" is actually not a warning at all but entirely about how great WakeUpNow is. And in fact, there were so many videos like this, a video called "Five Reasons Not to Join WakeUpNow" offered not a single reason why not to join WakeUpNow, but instead went on to describe what a super awesome company it is.
[156.36 - 161.93] IRA GLASS: So I'm joined in the studio right now by the two producers who were watching all these videos, Brian and Bianca. Hi, guys.
[161.93 - 162.44] BIANCA GIAEVER: Hi.
[162.44 - 162.95] BRIAN REED: Hey.
[162.95 - 167.42] IRA GLASS: So at that point, as best as you could tell, what was WakeUpNow?
[167.42 - 176.00] BRIAN REED: We honestly didn't know. Like, we couldn't figure it out. We eventually put some research in. We learned that, later, this move, the scam thing--
[176.00 - 178.58] IRA GLASS: You mean labeling videos "Such and Such is a Scam"?
[178.58 - 194.45] BRIAN REED: Yeah, exactly that. And then, having it not actually talk about it being a scam. So that's a move, I guess, that some people who are involved with certain companies or selling certain products will do. Like, that's a thing, I guess. But I'd never seen a video like that before. And it was really confusing.
[194.45 - 200.54] BIANCA GIAEVER: I mean, in so many of these WakeUpNow videos, we could tell people we're pitching something. But as far as we could tell, it wasn't a product.
[200.54 - 207.02] PANAMA: (SINGING) Build a bank, ah! I say, I say, I say, you need to build a bank, ah!
[207.02 - 208.06] IRA GLASS: So what is this?
[208.06 - 216.68] BIANCA GIAEVER: This is a video of a guy who calls himself Panama. And it's titled "WakeUpNow Scam, Lend a Hand, Build a Man, Woman."
[216.68 - 229.89] PANAMA: What are you doing? Eating carrots? Tomatoes? [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[229.89 - 239.03] BRIAN REED: So yeah, it wasn't really clear what WakeUpNow was. But still, there were hundreds of these videos. It was like this whole subculture with all these people, about thousands of people.
[239.03 - 242.81] IRA GLASS: OK, so then, I know what happened next is that you found out that WakeUpNow had a conference coming up, right?
[242.81 - 245.89] BIANCA GIAEVER: Yeah, and we went to try and figure out what this was.
[245.89 - 259.89] BRIAN REED: Yeah, and what we eventually found out is that it's something called "network marketing." It's a network marketing company. But also what we found out is that that is a very bland term for something completely mind-blowing, way beyond anything we could have imagined.
[259.89 - 274.37] IRA GLASS: So today on our radio program, Wake Up Now. If nothing else, I have to say, that is a completely genius name for a company. It promises so much so efficiently. That you'll open your eyes. You're life will be totally different, totally better.
[274.37 - 2204.09] IRA GLASS: And so, today, as New Year's approaches, as lots of people take stock of who they've been and make resolutions about who they want to be, we have stories of people in very different contexts who try to wake up and wake up others. Stay with us.
[2204.09 - 2225.18] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme. Today, with people making resolutions for how this new year will be different from the previous one, our show is "Wake Up Now." I hope you notice how classy we're keeping it here on the show by not inserting alarm clock sounds every time I say those words. Wake Up Now-- stories of people trying to wake themselves up or wake up others.
[2225.18 - 2252.37] IRA GLASS: We've arrived at Act 2 of our program, Act 2, Board Games. So there's this thing that comes up in the news pretty regularly, CEO pay. When it comes up, rarely is it good for the CEOs. Usually, the point is that CEOs are overpaid, something needs to be done. If you figure that most people work 40 or 50 years in their work lives, it would take a typical worker four or five lifetimes to earn what the CEOs of large companies earn in a single year.
[2252.37 - 2270.72] IRA GLASS: So you hear statistics like that in these stories. But what you almost never hear is anybody actually trying to cut the pay of a CEO. Well, David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein of NPR'S "Planet Money" found a guy who tried to wake people up to the fact of the CEO of one small company seemed to be making way too much money.
[2270.72 - 2279.60] DAVID KESTENBAUM: It takes an unusual person to wage a war against a CEO and his pay. The odds of success are just so low. And Tim Stabosz was definitely an outsider.
[2279.60 - 2290.37] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: He lived in a small town, Laporte, Indiana, in a small house. We went to visit. In the dining room, there's a broken Dungeons and Dragons pinball machine. Tim tried to fix it.
[2290.37 - 2298.47] TIM STABOSZ: Here it is. Yeah, it's sad. I made a boo-boo when I fried out the display. It was just a disaster.
[2298.47 - 2299.78] TIM STABOSZ: [LAUGHTER]
[2299.78 - 2300.66] TIM STABOSZ: nan
[2300.66 - 2319.37] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: When Tim got out of college, he got a government job and tried his hand at the stock market on the side. He used a computer to pick out stocks he thought were undervalued. He still has that computer. And just so you have the right image in your head, this is the kind of computer you'd find sitting out on the sidewalk. It's got a floppy disk drive. And when you turn it on, it just goes beep.
[2319.37 - 2320.70] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: [PRINTING NOISE]
[2320.70 - 2321.14] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: nan
[2321.14 - 2324.39] TIM STABOSZ: That's the dot matrix printer.
[2324.39 - 2330.96] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Over the years, Tim did well in the stock market, really well, well enough that he was never going to have to work a regular job again.
[2330.96 - 2344.85] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Sometime in the mid '90s, Tim came across this one company. He'd end up investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in its stock. It was a small company based on Long Island called P&F Industries. It made pneumatic tools. You can actually buy them at Home Depot.
[2344.85 - 2346.68] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Have you ever used one of the tools?
[2346.68 - 2348.57] TIM STABOSZ: I don't believe so, no.
[2348.57 - 2360.60] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Tim just like the company's numbers. It was a small company where you could understand everything about it. P&F seemed like a good deal. But over the years, something began to gnaw at him, the salary of the CEO, Richard Horowitz.
[2360.60 - 2363.93] TIM STABOSZ: Roughly $1 and 1/2 million a year, total compensation.
[2363.93 - 2365.34] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Is that a lot?
[2365.34 - 2370.35] TIM STABOSZ: $1 and 1/2 million is outrageous and outlandish.
[2370.35 - 2392.52] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Tim looked around at similar companies, some in the same industry, some in the same geographic area. And he couldn't find any where the CEO was paid even half of what Horowitz made. Now, if you just own a few shares of a company's stock and you think the CEO is overpaid, there isn't much you can do. But if you own more, well, that's different. And by the fall of 2009, Tim owned 180,000 shares.
[2392.52 - 2394.29] TIM STABOSZ: I came to own 5%.
[2394.29 - 2395.80] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: 5% of the whole company?
[2395.80 - 2397.74] TIM STABOSZ: 5% of the entire company.
[2397.74 - 2407.16] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: His stake was worth more than half a million dollars. And it turned out, Tim had an ally in this fight, a guy with a little more experience, a guy who ran a hedge fund.
[2407.16 - 2412.23] ANDREW SHAPIRO: I'm Andrew Shapiro. I'm president and portfolio manager of Lawndale Capital Management.
[2412.23 - 2425.43] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Andrew also owned a big chunk of the company, about 8%. He and Tim didn't work together directly. They had very different styles. Andrew was a by-the-book investor, fond of semi-obscure military allusions.
[2425.43 - 2436.11] ANDREW SHAPIRO: With what we do, we deploy what I call the Powell Doctrine of investments. And I try to take on targets where I can mount overwhelming force.
[2436.11 - 2450.00] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: For years, Andrew had been arguing that the CEO was grossly overpaid. Over one 10-year period, he says, Richard Horowitz took home $13.5 million dollars. That's more than twice what the entire company made in profits over that time.
[2450.00 - 2465.58] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Sometimes, when people complain about CEO pay, they talk about it as if the money's coming out of the pockets of ordinary workers. That is not how Tim and Andrew see it. Every dollar the CEO gets is $1 less profit, $1 less for Tim and Andrew and all the other stockholders.
[2465.58 - 2469.08] ANDREW SHAPIRO: The overpaid CEO's taking money out of the shareowner's pocket.
[2469.08 - 2476.10] DAVID KESTENBAUM: You're not in it because, hey, wouldn't it feel great if CEOs weren't paid so much more than everyone else?
[2476.10 - 2480.69] ANDREW SHAPIRO: I am doing this to make a return on our capital.
[2480.69 - 2502.94] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: This is why, if you think CEOs are overpaid rich guys, your best hope for changing things may be other rich guys, rich guys with enough money to buy up a bunch of stock and take on the company to try and cut the CEO's pay, in hopes of becoming even richer themselves.
[2502.94 - 2522.81] DAVID KESTENBAUM: We, of course, wanted to know what the CEO Richard Horowitz had to say about this. We tried to get him. We had a bunch of talks with the company's lawyer. In the end, Horowitz declined to be interviewed. But because this is a public company, there are plenty of recordings of him. Public companies have what are called "quarterly earnings calls" for investors, really anyone who wants to listen.
[2522.81 - 2527.06] OPERATOR: Good day, everyone. Thank you for holding. Today's conference will begin with a presentation and, then, a question and--
[2527.06 - 2531.89] DAVID KESTENBAUM: The operator starts the call. And then, here is the man himself, Richard Horowitz.
[2531.89 - 2538.76] RICHARD HOROWITZ: Firstly, I'm pleased to report that the company's revenue from continuing operations was $14,164,000.
[2538.76 - 2551.38] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I've listened to a lot of earnings calls like this over the years. Usually, they are incredibly dull. Analysts from big banks asking super specific things about the company's balance sheet. But remember, P&F is a small company.
[2551.38 - 2564.32] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And on some of these calls, there are only two people phoning in with questions, two people who feel the CEO is grossly overpaid, Andrew and Tim. They get to ask the CEO whatever they want. Here's one exchange.
[2564.32 - 2567.80] OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Stabosz. Your line is--
[2567.80 - 2582.11] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Tim is asking about this key thing that's used to determine a CEO's salary. It's called a compensation study. It looks at what CEOs at comparable companies are earning. P&F Industries had hired an external firm to do one of these reports. And Tim wanted details.
[2582.11 - 2582.96] RICHARD HOROWITZ: --a little shocked. That's the best I can tell you.
[2582.96 - 2588.29] TIM STABOSZ: So we're still waiting on a report from that outside firm, right?
[2588.29 - 2595.52] RICHARD HOROWITZ: I can't tell you. I don't know what the comp committee-- I mean, I don't-- I can't answer that question. I don't have the knowledge to answer that question.
[2595.52 - 2596.87] TIM STABOSZ: OK, um--
[2596.87 - 2601.23] RICHARD HOROWITZ: I'm not being evasive. I just don't know the answer, Tim. I'm sorry.
[2601.23 - 2606.67] TIM STABOSZ: OK. Well, you know that there's a firm that's-- we've certainly announced that there's a firm that's doing an analysis, right?
[2606.67 - 2608.69] RICHARD HOROWITZ: I can't-- I don't know.
[2608.69 - 2610.09] TIM STABOSZ: Does anyone in that room know?
[2610.09 - 2610.71] RICHARD HOROWITZ: It's not the purview of--
[2610.71 - 2614.40] TIM STABOSZ: Does the attorney for the company know?
[2614.40 - 2619.25] RICHARD HOROWITZ: Tim, I can't comment any further. And this is a Q2 conference call.
[2619.25 - 2620.81] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Q2 means second quarter.
[2620.81 - 2622.57] RICHARD HOROWITZ: We're talking about the results of Q2.
[2622.57 - 2622.89] TIM STABOSZ: Well--
[2622.89 - 2630.81] RICHARD HOROWITZ: So please, please, please, Tim, and Andrew and anybody else, please, let's keep the comments to the Q2 numbers. Thank you.
[2630.81 - 2636.20] TIM STABOSZ: Well, that's fine. But executive salaries are relevant to the future profitability and whatnot.
[2636.20 - 2639.37] RICHARD HOROWITZ: I can't comment any further, Tim. Any other questions about the Q2?
[2639.37 - 2646.88] TIM STABOSZ: Well, it would have been helpful if you would have simply said, we're not going to talk about executive compensation, period. Because that's what you're essentially saying, right?
[2646.88 - 2648.43] RICHARD HOROWITZ: Any other questions about Q2, Tim?
[2648.43 - 2651.35] TIM STABOSZ: I'll get back in queue. I'm frustrated right now, Richard.
[2651.35 - 2653.63] RICHARD HOROWITZ: OK, you'll handle it.
[2653.63 - 2659.46] OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Shapiro. Your line is open.
[2659.46 - 2667.85] DAVID KESTENBAUM: There are a lot of calls like this.
[2667.85 - 2686.21] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: A CEO's salary is set by a company's board of directors. And Shapiro suspected Richard Horowitz had packed the board with his cronies, people who paid him more than he deserved. So Andrew hired a private detective and did some digging himself. He discovered that, in fact, several board members played golf at the same country club as the CEO.
[2686.21 - 2694.28] ANDREW SHAPIRO: The Glen Oaks Country Club of Westbury, New York. Glen Oaks Country Club of Old Westbury, New York.
[2694.28 - 2709.19] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Nothing illegal or maybe even surprising about these guys blowing into the same country club. But still, what would General Colin Powell do? He'd get them off the board. Andrew suggested several potential new board members. And Tim, Tim nominated himself.
[2709.19 - 2720.71] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Getting new people on a board is tough. There is a vote. But in most cases, the existing board members get to decide who's on the ballot. It's as if members of Congress were the ones who decided who got to run for Congress.
[2720.71 - 2731.33] DAVID KESTENBAUM: So Tim and Andrew went to the company's annual meeting to try to convince the board to put their candidates on the ballot. It was the first time Andrew Shapiro and Richard Horowitz, the CEO, had met in person.
[2731.33 - 2743.93] ANDREW SHAPIRO: It actually was quite crowded. Every seat at the table was full. And there was the paid-for advisers standing around the periphery of the table, in the room, but along the wall.
[2743.93 - 2745.40] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Where was the CEO?
[2745.40 - 2748.07] ANDREW SHAPIRO: Oh, he's sitting directly across the table from me.
[2748.07 - 2750.68] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Oh, it must be awkward. What's it like?
[2750.68 - 2777.32] ANDREW SHAPIRO: Oh, it's not awkward or not. I go into these rooms with the distinct view that I am an owner of this business and you members of the board of directors are my agents. And you work for me. You don't work for Mr. Horowitz. You don't work for management. Management works for you, the board. And the board, you work for me and all of the other shareholders.
[2777.32 - 2797.54] DAVID KESTENBAUM: The board did not seem immediately swayed by this argument. And it's easy to imagine how this whole thing might feel on the other side if you're, say, Richard Horowitz, the CEO; if you've got two guys who have never even worked in the tool business telling you how they think the business that your father built up should be run and how much you should be paid and who should be on your board.
[2797.54 - 2813.53] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: For Tim Stabosz, what had started out as a rational investment, something just based on numbers, had become emotional, had become something hard to let go of. At some point in this whole fight, Tim's letters to the company took on a different tone. He got rid of the lawyer who'd been vetting them.
[2813.53 - 2829.98] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Some of the letters start to have words in all caps. Some start to feel weirdly intimate. One is addressed just to Richard and uses phrases like, "I was at the end of my rope," and, "goodness knows, I tried a different course."
[2829.98 - 2846.13] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And then, in the summer of 2010, more than a decade after Tim first bought stock in P&F Industries, something finally went his way. There was a change on the board. The two guys who played golf at the same country club as the CEO stepped down from the committee that set the CEO's pay.
[2846.13 - 2851.30] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Also, one of the people Andrew had recommended for the board got put on the ballot and elected.
[2851.30 - 2873.13] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And a year and a half later-- if you haven't noticed, this is an incredibly long process-- it finally happened, the thing that almost never happens. The board of P&F did what Andrew and Tim wanted. They cut Richard Horowitz's base salary by a lot, from $975,000 to $650,000, a cut of over $300,000.
[2873.13 - 2887.89] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: It actually made the news, at least a little corner of the news, an article in a publication called "Institutional Investor." An expert in that article said it was the first time he'd ever seen shareholders get a board to cut the pay of a sitting CEO.
[2887.89 - 2891.04] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Tim Stabosz, of course, was elated about the pay cut.
[2891.04 - 2899.95] TIM STABOSZ: Well, it felt fantastic. It felt great. It felt like I had served to effect this change, that I was an agent of change.
[2899.95 - 2915.52] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: That feeling did not last. It turns out, that new contract also made it easier for Richard Horowitz to get a bigger bonus. And in 2012, even though Horowitz's base pay had been cut, he actually ended up making more money than he had the previous year.
[2915.52 - 2921.96] DAVID KESTENBAUM: And then, earlier this year, Richard Horowitz got a raise. The board boosted his base pay by $50,000.
[2921.96 - 2926.86] TIM STABOSZ: And they also raised the bonus percentages, so he would be able to earn even more on the bonus.
[2926.86 - 2944.50] DAVID KESTENBAUM: The company only let us talk to one person on its side of things. But it was someone we definitely wanted to hear from, the board member that Andrew Shapiro had recommended. We met him one afternoon at a business club at the top of a tall building in Philadelphia. His name is Howard Brownstein. And he told us he thinks Richard Horowitz's pay is reasonable.
[2944.50 - 2960.76] HOWARD BROWNSTEIN: Yeah, I would say to you that, based on the work that the comp committee did, as they reported it to us and as we listened to it, that the compensation is within the realm of reasonableness for our company and how it's doing and the money we make for the shareholders.
[2960.76 - 2986.32] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: We asked Brownstein about that compensation study that Tim asked about on the conference call, the study that compares Richard Horowitz's pay to the CEOs of other companies. And we read Brownstein this letter Tim wrote, asking the board to release details from the report. "Asked" is probably the wrong word. Tim writes, I demand, in all caps. And then, at the end, also in caps, I have waited long enough. I am done waiting.
[2986.32 - 3010.59] HOWARD BROWNSTEIN: Well, Mr. Stabosz obviously hasn't been able to find the Caps Lock key on his typewriter. Look, generally in my world, when somebody demands something, it's because they have a legal right to it. He may say he demands it, but the fact is, he doesn't have a right to it. So what he really meant when he said, I demand it, is I really, really want it. I get it. It's OK. You can't have it. Next.
[3010.59 - 3012.66] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: He's one of the owners of the company, right?
[3012.66 - 3022.17] HOWARD BROWNSTEIN: Sure he is. But the owners of the company only have the rights that they have, the rights the law gives them. It doesn't give them more than that.
[3022.17 - 3033.60] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Since P&F wouldn't release that study, we asked a company that analyzes CEO compensation to take a look. The company is called Equilar. They do a lot of work for companies who are trying to figure out how much to pay their CEOs.
[3033.60 - 3056.70] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Here is what Equilar found. Among roughly 200 companies of similar size, Richard Horowitz's pay ranked near the very top, in the top 7%, more than twice the average. Equilar also looked at a smaller group of companies that, like P&F, are in what's called the "industrial goods" sector. There were 13 companies in that group. The top paid CEO was Richard Horowitz.
[3056.70 - 3070.05] DAVID KESTENBAUM: In other words, according to the study, Richard Horowitz is one of the highest paid or the highest paid CEO for what he does.
[3070.05 - 3079.65] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Tim Stabosz lost. But he had owned shares in P&F for most of his adult life. And when you've been in something that long, it can be hard to know when to walk away.
[3079.65 - 3082.42] DAVID KESTENBAUM: What happens next? Are you going to keep at this?
[3082.42 - 3095.45] TIM STABOSZ: That's a good question. I hadn't thought about that. Um, yeah, yeah. I want the company to know that I'm not going anywhere.
[3095.45 - 3099.56] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Do you ever think about giving up?
[3099.56 - 3102.16] TIM STABOSZ: Um, no.
[3102.16 - 3102.55] DAVID KESTENBAUM: Really?
[3102.55 - 3105.52] TIM STABOSZ: Well, I mean, I'm trying to think about what giving up means.
[3105.52 - 3120.16] DAVID KESTENBAUM: I can tell you what giving up looks like. After we talked to Tim this summer, he had a momentary cash crunch. He had to sell all his shares. The company bought them from him. And as part of the deal, Tim promised not to buy any shares of P&F Industries for three years.
[3120.16 - 3142.23] JACOB GOLDSTEIN: It turns out it's really hard to cut a CEO's pay, even if you own 5% of the company. Now, he has even less power to do anything about it. Now, Tim Stabosz is just like everybody else.

[3175.92 - 3202.41] IRA GLASS: Act 3, Sleep No More. OK, so to end today's program about waking up, let's leave the world of metaphor completely. So we're not talking about waking up to a new way of seeing the world or waking up to the things you need to do to change your life or waking up other people to the issue of overpaid CEOs, or whatever issue. I'm talking about just waking up, just waking up, pure and simple. That shouldn't be hard, right? You do it every day.

[3205.50 - 3215.50] IRA GLASS: Springfield, Oregon, Monday morning during finals week, 7:30. Morgan Peach, a grad student hears the alarm that's supposed to wake him up. And he shuts it off. This happens again at 7:35.
[3215.50 - 3216.95] IRA GLASS: [ALARM BEEPING]
[3216.95 - 3218.38] IRA GLASS: And again at 7:40.
[3218.38 - 3219.37] MORGAN PEACH: [MOANING]
[3219.37 - 3220.37] MORGAN PEACH: [ALARM BEEPING]
[3220.37 - 3222.58] MORGAN PEACH: nan
[3222.58 - 3224.00] IRA GLASS: Once more at 7:45.
[3224.00 - 3225.29] IRA GLASS: [ALARM BEEPING]

[3227.14 - 3234.07] IRA GLASS: You get the idea, 8:15, 8:25. Finally, 9 o'clock, his girlfriend, Angela Evancie, who made this recording, steps in.
[3234.07 - 3236.44] MORGAN PEACH: [DEEP INHALE] It's time.
[3236.44 - 3237.49] ANGELA EVANCIE: It's time.
[3237.49 - 3238.92] MORGAN PEACH: It's time.
[3238.92 - 3256.22] IRA GLASS: Right. He doesn't get up. Besides an exam, he has two research papers to turn in and 55 exams and papers to grade. Angela sees him struggle everyday with waking up. But she thought, this week-- this week-- for once, he would do it when the alarm sounds, because he has so much to do.
[3256.22 - 3269.46] IRA GLASS: Tuesday, it goes off first at 7:30, then seven more times. 7:40, 7:45, 8 o'clock, 8:05, 8:10, 8:15, 8:20. Wednesday, pretty much the same deal. At some point, Angela says to her sleeping boyfriend--
[3269.46 - 3272.20] ANGELA EVANCIE: You set the alarm for 9 o'clock?
[3272.20 - 3276.15] MORGAN PEACH: Yes, I did.
[3276.15 - 3279.57] ANGELA EVANCIE: Can you afford to sleep in that late?
[3279.57 - 3285.61] MORGAN PEACH: Certainly can. I'm wealthy in time, not in money.
[3285.61 - 3296.46] IRA GLASS: People can be surprisingly articulate when they're barely awake sometimes. Wednesday night, Morgan tells Angela that the next morning, Thursday, he actually is going to have to get up. The geography paper's due at noon.
[3296.46 - 3307.48] MORGAN PEACH: Yeah, could you set the alarm for 7:30 tomorrow? I'd like to get up at 7:30 and work on my research papers and finish them.
[3307.48 - 3308.86] IRA GLASS: So next morning.
[3308.86 - 3323.65] ANGELA EVANCIE: (WHISPERING) And now it's 8:00. The alarm went off. And he reset it for 8:30. I really thought he was going to do it this morning.
[3323.65 - 3327.75] IRA GLASS: Sometime near 10:00 AM, they finally have this conversation.
[3327.75 - 3328.86] ANGELA EVANCIE: It's time to get up.
[3328.86 - 3332.12] MORGAN PEACH: [YAWN] That's what you always say.
[3332.12 - 3340.72] IRA GLASS: And then, still lying in bed. He explains the whole thing perfectly. It would be impossible to say this better.
[3340.72 - 3365.37] MORGAN PEACH: (SLEEPILY) It's almost as if the sleeping is that much sweeter when you have to get up or you think you have to get up, and then you don't.
