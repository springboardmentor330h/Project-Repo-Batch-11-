MAN: Are you going to wear these Hong Kong suits that you've had made? JOHN LENNON: George and I haven't had any made. Paul's had one. That's all. MAN: Now, Paul, you've bought a Chinese suit? PAUL MCCARTNEY: Yes, it's true. Two, I got. MAN: Did you? How much did you pay for them? PAUL MCCARTNEY: It wasn't very dear. About 10 quid, I think. Yeah. Oh, it was great, actually, because somebody said, "You've got to haggle and get the prices down." So some little fellow was selling some ornaments. And he wanted $160 for them. No, he was selling a watch. That's it. He wanted 160 Hong Kong dollars for it. So I kept saying to him, "No that's not right. Not right. $100, that's right."
