CANDIDO TIRADO: And her mother says, take them to the train station. CARMEN RIVERA: Her mother doesn't know anything. CANDIDO TIRADO: So I know we're not going to make it to the train station because in the car we are going to blows. So she takes the back roads down the tomato fields and she begins to berate us. CARMEN RIVERA: She starts arguing. She just rehashes the whole argument all over again and how we couldn't make it on our own to the train station. CANDIDO TIRADO: You're so smart, why don't you make it on your own? CARMEN RIVERA: And we had just done it before-- CANDIDO TIRADO: I'm in Arkansas, that's why. CARMEN RIVERA: That's true. So she says, if you don't let me speak, I'm going to throw you out of the car. CANDIDO TIRADO: So we said, throw us out. CARMEN RIVERA: Throw us out. CANDIDO TIRADO: Which she did. CARMEN RIVERA: She gets out of the car. She takes all our bags out-- CANDIDO TIRADO: Throws them in the street. CARMEN RIVERA: She's like, get out of here, I never want to see you again. CANDIDO TIRADO: Stops traffic.
