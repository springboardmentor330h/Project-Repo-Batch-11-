PETER CLOWNEY: Reverend Sharp founded this church 31 years ago, with 12 people. Faith Tabernacle Baptist Church now has 500 members, too many for this building. And last year, Reverend Sharp made a decision. He told his congregation, look, we're going to pay $90,000 left on our mortgage. Not by the year 2004, like we're supposed to, but now. Because once we've done that, we can start building. We can build a place that can hold all of us. PETER CLOWNEY: A year later, even Reverend Sharp is surprised that they did it. REV. DONALD SHARP: When we began last year to make a determination that we were going to engage in this campaign, I had to be very honest with you, I had some serious doubts.
