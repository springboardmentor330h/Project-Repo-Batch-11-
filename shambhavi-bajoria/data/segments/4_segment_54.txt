IRA GLASS: David Sedaris is the author of Barrel Fever and the forthcoming book Naked. And I know what you're thinking. Every time you turn on the public radio, it's the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. IRA GLASS: IRA GLASS: Yeah, whatever that means. IRA GLASS: Our program was produced today but Peter Clowney, Alix Spiegel, Nancy Updike, and myself. Contributing editors Paul Tough, Jack Hitt, and Margy Rochlin. Some songs today were provided by Steve Cushing and the Blues Before Sunrise radio network. But not this one. IRA GLASS: IRA GLASS: WBEZ management oversight by Torey Malatia. I'm Ira Glass. DAVID SEDARIS: What will he find out there in the forbidden zone, Dr. Zaius? Damn you! Damn you all to hell!
