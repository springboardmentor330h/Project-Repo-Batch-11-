CLASS: PLAYING COACH: So it's minus 12 degrees outside, and I'm at an out-of-town game coaching the Lady Diamondbacks. Can you believe it? You couldn't find a sweeter, more talented group of girls.

Drink up now son. It's Christmas time, and we've got an early morning's Mass tomorrow. That was the last time I saw her. PLAYING TEACHER: I like that, corduroy and the Lady Diamondbacks. What else?
