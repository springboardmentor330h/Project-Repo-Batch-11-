In other words, I really didn't have a lot of time beating myself and saying "This is wrong. This is wrong," in terms of buying a Black Panther newspaper or supporting the Black Panthers in those days or something. That might have been considered-- that was a sin for a Jehovah's Witness. MICHAEL WARR: But I was convinced by the conditions at the time that hey, if it's a sin, it's the right thing to do. I doubt if I could have explained it that way at the time. But I know I didn't feel guilty about it. IRA GLASS: Michael Warr, thank you for coming into our radio playhouse and reading for us. MICHAEL WARR: Thank you. It's the most I've talked about the Jehovah's Witnesses in years.
