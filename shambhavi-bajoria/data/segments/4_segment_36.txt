DAVID SEDARIS: Dale used the downtime as an opportunity to compose a few new songs. DAVID SEDARIS:  I'm well aware they were from Delaware. DAVID SEDARIS: Days later he was asking for a word that might rhyme with Utah. That'll keep you up all night. I know from experience. DAVID SEDARIS: We reach San Francisco where Ronnie had gotten me a room at a residence hotel on Market Street. Dale stayed for a week, leaving by bus the day after I walked in on him standing naked before a full length mirror singing  "San Francisco, you stole my heart. Now that I found you, I'll never part. California's stirring in my blood." DAVID SEDARIS: His privates were covered by the guitar, but his pale, spotted rear end was more than I could bear. Ronnie and I stayed on for three months before taking off to pick pears in Oregon.
