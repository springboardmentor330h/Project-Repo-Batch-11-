I was like a child. I was like a child because I had no one I can turn to. My parents had passed. I had no one I could turn to. And I felt like every time I would listen to that, I felt as though she was talking directly to me. And for me, that meant that I was on my own in this prison situation. And I was going to have to make it the best way that I could. And I was going to have to muster all the energy that I could possibly muster.
