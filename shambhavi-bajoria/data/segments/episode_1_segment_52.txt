Go on and help yourself, but you better not take too much. Mama may have, Papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own. God bless the child that's got his own. ED RYDER: That's basically some of it. IRA GLASS: Ed Ryder joining us in the playhouse from the studios of WHYY in Philadelphia, speaking with me and associate producer Nancy Updike. Ed Ryder's a big Billie Holiday fanatic. That was the word he used, "fanatic," when we asked him about it. So when we asked him to play a number with his horn, with his trumpet, he played "Lover Man." IRA GLASS: IRA GLASS: That's pretty much all the time we have for this evening. IRA GLASS: IRA GLASS: This show was produced by Dolores Wilber, Peter Clowney, Nancy Updike, Alix Spiegel, and myself.
