I lugged my guitar into the music shop, where the manager led me to my teacher, a temperamental midget named Mr. Mancini. DAVID SEDARIS: DAVID SEDARIS: A fastidious dresser stuck in a small town, Mr. Mancini wore clothing I recognized from the young boys department at Hudson Belk's. Some nights he favored button-up shirts with clip-on ties, while other evenings I arrived to find him dressed in flared slacks and a snug turtleneck sweater, a swag of love beads hanging from his neck. His arms were manly and covered in coarse dark hair, but his voice was high and strange, as if it had been recorded and played back at a higher speed. DAVID SEDARIS: My fascination was both evident and unwelcome.
