So much radio listening happens in the car. This radio signal is one that our contributing editor Jack Hitt chanced upon on a long drive. It was my decision. I don't want to get into it. You hire and fire until you get one that works. Last month, I was cruising the backwoods of Massachusetts on assignment in a rental car. For the longest time, radio wasn't much help in relieving the boredom of interstate travel. After three hours, my finger was numb from jamming the Seek button when the radio suddenly snagged this station.
