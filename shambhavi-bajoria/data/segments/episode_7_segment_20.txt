Buck has to athletically leap behind and push against his big behind, as though it were one of Yul Brynner's obelisks in The Ten Commandments. SANDRA TSING LOH: And Joey's over. And his skirt lifts out behind him like a magic cape. And he and the other dogs are sailing, flying over the San Fernando Valley. For the first time, they look down at the humming suburban grid that was outside that back gate the whole time. SANDRA TSING LOH: The slowly revolving orange and yellow sign of the Canoga Park Motor Inn, Canoga Park Bowl. Canoga Park Motor Inn, Canoga Park Bowl. Canoga Park Motor Inn, Canoga Park Bowl-- and the Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. And the Winnetka 5 Drive-in movie theater, which is playing Nightmare on Elm Street Part 5 again. SANDRA TSING LOH: And Roscoe and  those harsh West Valley speedways over which grimy King Auto Bear shops glower. And the yellow ranch-style houses with their balding lawns, whose occupants keep using the drought as an excuse for letting everything go to pot. Occupants who eek out their sad, daily lives of quiet desperation. Prisoners of the People Magazine demographics which enslave them.
