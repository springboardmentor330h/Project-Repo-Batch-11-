Today on our playhouse stage, small-scale stories of small-scale sin. Stay with us, won't you? IRA GLASS: So K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. But they were not too successful at this. And at a McDonald's on Times Square in New York City, they told all. Doesn't that have a nice, Hard  Copy sound to it? "They told all." IRA GLASS: This was kind of an unpleasant McDonald's. Because it was in Times Square, they decided to have neon lights everywhere in this place. A crush of sweaty people at the counter, tourists, most of us. It was the middle of summer. Fred took charge. FRED: What do you guys want? K-RAD: I want a number one meal.
