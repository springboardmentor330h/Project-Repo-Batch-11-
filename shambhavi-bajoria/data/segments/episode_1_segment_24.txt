IRA GLASS: Is Barry there? RECEPTIONIST: Yes, he is. He's on another call. Do you wish to hold, or I could take a message, or you can leave one on his voicemail? IRA GLASS: It's his son. RECEPTIONIST: Uh-huh. IRA GLASS: Isn't this starting to sound like-- this little dialogue-- isn't it starting to sound like an episode of Dr. Katz? You know that TV show? "This is his son." "Uh-huh. Yeah." Anyway, so I thought I would call my parents in Baltimore and ask for advice on this, our first evening of our brand new radio show, Your Radio Playhouse. IRA GLASS: Can I leave a message with you? Or is it better to use his voicemail? RECEPTIONIST: It doesn't matter. I'll put it right on his voicemail.
