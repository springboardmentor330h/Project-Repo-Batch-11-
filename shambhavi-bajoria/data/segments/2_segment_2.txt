FRED: OK, I'm paying for this. You're paying for my cab, OK? Whatever I can pay for. OK, we'll have a number one meal. IRA GLASS: They're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer, and Fred was not used to the downtown prices. FRED: Oh my god. It's $5, man. You guys are chipping in.

But K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. All of them involve computers. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time. IRA GLASS: All in all, they didn't steal very much. And they didn't steal very effectively. But they did try to steal.
