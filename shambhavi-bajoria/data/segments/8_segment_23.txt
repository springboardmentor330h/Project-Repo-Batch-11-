MARIO RAMIREZ: Oh, yesterday. Yesterday, right? IRA GLASS: Tell us all the story. Where were you guys? MARIO RAMIREZ: Well, we're all sitting down, and she don't really talk that much, and all of a sudden she just came out. She got mad at me and called me a real bad word. She just goes, hey, you-- and everyone started laughing, so it was nice. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Was it in Spanish or in English? MARIO RAMIREZ: Spanish. No, it was in English actually. CLAUDIA PEREZ: I want to know. MARIO RAMIREZ: CLAUDIA PEREZ: Pussy. CLAUDIA PEREZ: She's just about to turn three, and this happened at Christmas dinner. You know, Mexican families are big. They were all there, and they all laughed.
