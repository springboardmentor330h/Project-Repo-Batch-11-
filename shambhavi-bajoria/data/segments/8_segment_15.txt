He doesn't party. He doesn't like trouble in the street. And before long, he asks Claudia for her phone number. MIGUEL: Give me your number too. Why don't you give me your number, and I'll call you too. And when you're famous, I'll be famous with you too. CLAUDIA PEREZ: All right. I'll give you-- this is my pager number. CLAUDIA PEREZ: I told him I wanted to be a fashion designer and a writer someday, and he said-- MIGUEL: OK, you can write a book about me. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Yeah, I'm going to write a book. MIGUEL: About me, though, right? IRA GLASS: We headed over to the cosmetics counter. It appeared to this correspondent that Miguel wanted Claudia's phone number for a date. CLAUDIA PEREZ: I thought he just wanted it for business. IRA GLASS: He is definitely calling you. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Well, I don't know. We'll see if he calls. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Next, we went to Los Comales.
