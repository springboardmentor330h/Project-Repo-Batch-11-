Can I get an advance? I want some boots. PLAYING COACH: Can the money be spent on lodging? PLAYING TEACHER: The money can be spent on anything you want, lodging, boots, gas, even stamps. PLAYING IRISH STUDENT: What about drink and games of chance? PLAYING TEACHER: That too. But first, you've got to sell your story. Which means you'll have to know your audience. CLASS: PLAYING TEACHER: People, listen, listen. If you spent last Christmas, I don't know, coaching midget league basketball or designing a patio, chances are, the editors over at Cat Fancy or Chocolatier aren't going to be too interested. PLAYING COACH: But can't you spend the holidays coaching midget league, and like cats, and chocolate? I do. PLAYING TEACHER: No. Of course, you can do both.
