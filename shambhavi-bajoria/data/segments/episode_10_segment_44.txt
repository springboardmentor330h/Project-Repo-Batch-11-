IRA GLASS: Well, I'm glad we got to that then. IRA GLASS: My mom. Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore. IRA GLASS: Act Four, Sins of the Fathers. What does it do to children if parents tell a big lie for years? Part of Susan Bergman's book, Anonymity, is her trying to understand the two parts of her father, strict, religious, family man; promiscuous, gay, night clubber. His personality was split in half, she writes, into two irreconcilable halves. IRA GLASS: But part of her book is about her discovery that growing up in his home, she became somebody who was also split in half, somebody able to carry on a life with two irreconcilable parts. She found herself as an adult, leading a double life. To end our program, we asked her to read from her book. SUSAN BERGMAN: I pretend I am a faithful wife. My husband is married to that faithful woman. The woman looks like me. She moves around in my body.
