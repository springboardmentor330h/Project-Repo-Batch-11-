But it is entertaining. When you imagine what you'd like to do on your radio show, what would you like to do? The kind of program, the kind of show that would not take people too seriously, like government leaders, politicians. When you describe it that way, it makes it sound like you'd have mostly a political show. You saw in Howard Stern's movie, Private Parts, he has, like, naked ladies in the studio.
