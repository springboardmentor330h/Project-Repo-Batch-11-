LISA BUSCANI: I did not know what I was going to do and, blessedly, I did not care. I sat quietly on the train back to the city, feeling my back muscles slowly unravel and my stomach lift six inches into my heart. The warmth started in my cheeks and spread down to my fingers, down to my feet. My lungs expanded completely, which hurt a bit. It felt like I had been swimming all day and had forgotten to breathe. I didn't mind the pain. Peace is a fine travelling companion. IRA GLASS: Lisa Buscani. More from her in a minute. But first this song from Robert Metrick, first performed in Chicago's Club Lower Lengths. You're listening to Your Radio Playhouse.
