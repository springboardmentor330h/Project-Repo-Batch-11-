EVAN HARRIS: The word "quitter" does have a negative connotation, and that's something that I would really like to change. I would really like to kidnap that word. I see quitters as people who have volition. Quitters never win and winners never quit, and that's completely untrue. I mean really the more things you quit, the more things you're going to do. And the more things you do, the more potential you have for success. EVAN HARRIS: I mean, I would say that Quitter Quarterly as a thing is definitely pro-quitting propaganda. I mean, absolutely. But I'm not so much describing-- well, maybe I'm describing a little bit what quits feel like. But I'm much more interested in the anatomy of quitting. I would say that the anatomy of an actual quit would vary, but the general form of a quit would be that the quitter thinks about it. The quitter thinks about it some more. The quitter quits. And then there's the post-quitting stuff.
