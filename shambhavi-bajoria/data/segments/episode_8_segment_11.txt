WOMAN: IRA GLASS: Tacanos. She's saying they're cheap. Over the years, so many Mexicans have done well in Chicago that lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood to the suburbs. This woman said 80% of her customers this year were Mexicans who've moved to the suburbs but who have come back here to shop. CLAUDIA PEREZ: They don't forget where they come from. In the hallway, we found this man from the suburbs. He says he comes here to get what the Mexicano wears. MAN: CLAUDIA PEREZ: He says it feels like you're in Mexico here. He comes here to see the paisanos. He came here with his friends so they could get to know Little Village. IRA GLASS: 1995 was fine for him, he said. He finally got a stable job in a restaurant. He doesn't have to be jumping from factory to factory.
