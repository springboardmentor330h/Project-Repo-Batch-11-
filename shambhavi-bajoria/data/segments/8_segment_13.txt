RICARDO: My brother. He bores me. When he goes to places, he doesn't take me anywhere. He doesn't take me with him. CLAUDIA PEREZ: And he's older than you? RICARDO: I'm nine and he's 15. IRA GLASS: But when he was 13, would he take you with him? Was there a time when he would take you all the time? RICARDO: No. IRA GLASS: No, he never took you. RICARDO: Nowhere. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Miguel is a salesperson at CJ's. When I saw him, I knew for sure that he would speak English. I could just tell. He's 19, has a goatee, is tall,  complexion. I asked him how his year was. MIGUEL: This year's been my best year so far.
