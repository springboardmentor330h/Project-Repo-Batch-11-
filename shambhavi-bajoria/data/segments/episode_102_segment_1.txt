DISHWASHER PETE: And Greyhound's conducive for your traveling ministry? STEVE: Well, in the fact that I do not have my own privacy, like in a private vehicle, there becomes an either intermeshing or clashing of spirits like on a crowded-type Greyhound. Sometimes things are more harmonious, and other times people pick and poke and they solicit a reaction. DISHWASHER PETE: So normally your preaching on the bus would come with you just talking to the person sitting next to you? STEVE: Most of my preaching is done by myself, just speaking into the air, though, without another human being being there. You might be one of the first human beings that's ever really listened to me or acknowledged that in my presence.
