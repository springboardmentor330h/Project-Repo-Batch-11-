VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: I'm sure you did, Ira. IRA GLASS: Well, I'm telling you up front. And we want you to listen to the four of them and identify which one is the one where the chicken is done. In other words, can you tell that the chicken is done without any visual cues, without the help of smelling what the chicken is smelling like? Can it be done purely, purely on the basis of sound? IRA GLASS: Let's roll. And our listeners at home can play along with us here. Let's roll the first little sample sound. IRA GLASS: VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: I would say-- IRA GLASS: Yeah? VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: I'd say that's something like the middle. IRA GLASS: OK. But that definitely isn't towards the end, you're saying. VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: Yeah, it's in the middle going toward the end. It's in the three fourths part. IRA GLASS: OK, let's hear sound number two, please. IRA GLASS: VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: Number two is toward the end, too. VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: OK.
