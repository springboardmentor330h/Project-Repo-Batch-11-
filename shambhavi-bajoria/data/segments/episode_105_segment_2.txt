I always just assumed I would never marry a white girl, that those relationships don't work out, probably because I watched my parents' interracial marriage end. I assumed that race had something to do with it, that my blond-haired, blue-eyed, Indiana farm girl mother and my black, Brooklyn-born father were doomed from the start, destined to end up in separate worlds.

Though, if you ask my white grandmother, my mother's mother, my sisters and I aren't proof of anything. GRANDMA: I said you don't sound like a black person than you aren't black, because I'm white and you're my grandson. RICH ROBINSON: So black people should sound a certain way?
