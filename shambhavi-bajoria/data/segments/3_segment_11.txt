IRA GLASS: It's Ira Glass. MRS. MATTOON: Hi, Ira Glass. IRA GLASS: Mrs. Mattoon, here's why I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio about Duki. MRS. MATTOON: Duki. IRA GLASS: Duki. And I contacted your daughter, Ashley. And she said that for me to book Duki on to my radio show, I was going to first need to contact Yona Lu. MRS. MATTOON: Yeah, you would need to do that. IRA GLASS: And that I needed to do that through you. MRS. MATTOON: Yeah. IRA GLASS: Who is Yona Lu? MRS. MATTOON: Yona Lu is-- she's a hedgehog. She's basically taken charge of Duki's financial affairs. And I presume this has something to do with money? IRA GLASS: I don't know, actually.
