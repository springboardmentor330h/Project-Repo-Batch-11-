FAITH TABERNACLE BAPTIST CHURCH CHOIR: IRA GLASS: So we wanted a Christmas story for this week that really was more religiously based. And we wanted some Christmas music. And to get both, we decided to visit a church that had something very specific to celebrate this year, and a great choir with which to celebrate it. One of our production staff, Peter Clowney, went to Faith Tabernacle Baptist Church. PETER CLOWNEY: The church meets in a smallish building on South Cornell, near 82nd and Stony Brook. It's in a middle class neighborhood, but there's some tougher areas nearby. By about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning maybe 50 people are occupying the warm second-floor sanctuary. PETER CLOWNEY: They sit in groups, talking about their lives with Christ this week, about other things. And some people are praying. By 11:30, about 100 people are gathered this way. And when the praise and worship starts, music dissolves these little groups into one congregation. FAITH TABERNACLE BAPTIST CHURCH CHOIR: PETER CLOWNEY: Reverend Donald Sharp begins the service at noon. He tells people to greet each other in the pews, to meet their neighbors.
