DONDI: I hate you, Peter. PETER: I don't blame you. PETER: DONDI: Grandmother, be careful. Grazie. PETER: My deal. Straight, five card draw. CALEB: Anything wild? PETER: No. DONDI: CALEB: Shut up. Ow. Watch it with those cards, man. PETER: Sorry. CALEB: What's your problem today? DONDI: He has sinned. PETER: Yeah-- yes, I have. How did you know? DONDI: Your eyes. They are the eyes of an accused man, furtive, alert, the eyes of a nervous beast who, once a lover of gambols and jigs and standard metals, has been driven to nocturnal skulking by the pursuit of a relentless predator. CALEB: He's got you there. 10,000 lira. DONDI: Call. PETER: Call. Caleb, do you believe in sin? CALEB: Hell, no.
