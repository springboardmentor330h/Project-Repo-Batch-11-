PETER: What do you guys think the worst sin is? Murder? DONDI: Betrayal. PETER: Why do you say that? DONDI: At the center of the ninth and innermost frozen circle of hell, Lucifer devours Judas eternally. PETER: Really? DONDI: That's what they say. One million lira. PETER: I'll see that and raise you one. CALEB: Call. DONDI: I'm there. CALEB: What do you got? DONDI: Seven aces. PETER: Me too. CALEB: So do I. All right, so there were a few too many wild cards. Let's hold the pot over. DONDI: OK. Peter? PETER: Huh? Oh, sure. Leave it over. Do you think a sin is worse if say you, for example, you betray somebody? Then suppose you don't feel any remorse. Does that make it worse?
