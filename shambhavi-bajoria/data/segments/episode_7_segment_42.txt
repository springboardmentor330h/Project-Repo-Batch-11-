LISA BUSCANI: The end happened several times, actually. We would inevitably hook up again and mess around. We just didn't look in each other's eyes is all. One night we were eating dinner and his smile was less than honest. And I thought, well, then this is it. I said, I've been working far too hard for far too long. And he agreed, and I wanted him to fight it, and was disappointed by how light he was. Smiling, so ready to fly. I felt light, too, but it was the way you are before you catch a cold, all unfocused and buzzing. And the chill comes from inside. IRA GLASS: Lisa Buscani. IRA GLASS: Dwight Okita has this poem about quitting from his book Crossing with the Light. He wrote it back when he worked as a dance instructor. It's about a student he became friends with.
