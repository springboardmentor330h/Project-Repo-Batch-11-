Maybe two Christmas songs in their entire morning service. And when I asked people about it, they told me, they celebrate Christ year round. So why should Christmas be any different. ANGELA COOK: I give God praise whether it be Christmas, Easter. I just don't take one day out of the year to celebrate. I celebrate all the time. Hallelujah, because God is good. Yes he is. He's good. I'm getting excited. PETER CLOWNEY: That's Angela Cook, a member of the choir for 25 years. She's one of the soloists. FAITH TABERNACLE BAPTIST CHURCH CHOIR: PETER CLOWNEY: 4:30, we're back at the church for the mortgage burn. First, everyone takes battery powered candles and marches around the building. REV. DONALD SHARP:  We've come this far by faith. Leaning on the Lord. Trusting in his holy word.
