And then my mom's going on and on, and she doesn't know how to tell stories correctly. And I know you're thinking it's a familial trait.

And then I couldn't find the change for the ten, and then the car, and so--" And I just go, "Oh, huh. When you can't find your change and you meet someone from the Balkans at the store, and why are you talking to people at Pavilions?"
