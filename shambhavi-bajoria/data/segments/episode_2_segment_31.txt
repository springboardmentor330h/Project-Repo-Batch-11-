And the fascinating thing about the Jehovah's Witnesses, and this is something that affects me to this very day, is that it was a very multicultural type of religion. MICHAEL WARR: And so I would look at these pictures. And I noticed that when there were black people in the pictures, that the sisters, their heads were always covered. And that was because there was a political issue that had not really been resolved. And that is in paradise, what would their hair be like?

And believe it or not, this was like a political awakening for me because in high school, these were serious issues. The natural was just like the Black Power sign.
