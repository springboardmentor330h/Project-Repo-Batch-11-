Stay with us. IRA GLASS: Act One, The Book Tour. Susan Bergman came to our studios, loaded down with evidence. IRA GLASS: OK, now you've brought in some tapes of yourself being interviewed on talk radio shows that I've got here. So this first one, do we need to explain it at all before we play it? SUSAN BERGMAN: I think this was a caller that was, in some ways, typical of the response that I got on talk radio. IRA GLASS: Here we go. MAN: I have a particularly close connection to this sort of thing. I'm a gay father, divorced now. So I'm very close to this. In particular, I can understand your father's secretiveness and his pain. There's always the resentment that you had to go through the pain, that you had to hide, that you had to lie. And you live with that resentment. It really never quite goes away, even in my case, after you've come completely out and divorced and the whole bit. And the resentment lives on, that I had to do live that lie, that I had to lie to my wife, that I had to lie to my children, that I had to life to my family. And never be happy. Never, never, never know happiness.
