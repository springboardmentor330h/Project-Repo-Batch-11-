Maybe meeting some more girls, for example. That's about it. CLAUDIA PEREZ: He had a wish for 1996. MIGUEL: Maybe hook up with some girl that I want right now. No names right now. IRA GLASS: Does she know yet that you want to go out with her? MIGUEL: Yeah, she knows. IRA GLASS: When's the first date going to happen? MIGUEL: When her father lets her out. CLAUDIA PEREZ: How old is she? MIGUEL: She's like 18, 17. CLAUDIA PEREZ: And they don't let her out yet? MIGUEL: Not at all. I guess she's got one of those strict parents. IRA GLASS: We talk to Miguel for a while. In '96, he'll graduate from DeVry to become an electronic technician.
