Yeah. Can you tell me what happened? Well, first, the lady had no idea what I was talking about. I told her East Timor. She said, East what? She probably thought I was calling from the East Side in New York. After, I tried to explain-- she even didn't know what the Nobel Peace Prize is all about. She had never heard of the Nobel Peace Prize?
