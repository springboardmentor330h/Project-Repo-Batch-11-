So what happened? So how come you're not there? Oh, because in 1996, I guess Viacom could own more than one station, and they decided that they wanted to have a station that appealed to males age 25 to 54. So they changed the format from pure rock, which is what they called it, to classic rock. These distinctions you're making-- pure rock versus classic rock versus new rock-- it's so Talmudic.
