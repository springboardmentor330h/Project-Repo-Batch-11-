Where did he come from? IRA GLASS: They attempted to recall this. And then one of them did. Guy Frank is Duki's imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend. IRA GLASS: As you might imagine, not everyone in the family takes all this so lightly. Danielle's father, for example, was never too keen on it. MRS. MATTOON: He was quite actually bothered by the whole-- he thought we maybe had a problem in the family. IRA GLASS: Really? MRS. MATTOON: Mm-hmm. For a while there, we had two daughters that only communicated through a duck. IRA GLASS: Yeah. That period that you're describing, when do you mean? MRS. MATTOON: I would say they maybe were 10 and 12 or 9 and 11.
