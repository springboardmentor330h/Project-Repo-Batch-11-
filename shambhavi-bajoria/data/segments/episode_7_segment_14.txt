EVAN HARRIS: Right. IRA GLASS: Evan, I have to say that you're saying people should be aware of themselves as being part of a world of quitting, and a world of people who are quitting, and a whole idea of the notion of quitting. But I have to say, in all of my life, you are the only person I've ever met who thinks of it that way. EVAN HARRIS: Oh, but you're so wrong about that. Oh well, maybe you're not wrong. Am I really the only person you've ever met who thinks of quitting in this way? IRA GLASS: You yourself said you didn't start to think about quitting in this way before February. EVAN HARRIS: Right, but just because I didn't start to think about it before February doesn't mean that no one else has ever thought of it before.
