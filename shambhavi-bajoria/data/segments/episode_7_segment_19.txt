Big mountains, big valleys, big sky, big water. It's Marlboro country." SANDRA TSING LOH: Joey and Flipper can almost hear the National Geographic theme playing. It is the sound of 2,000 Maasai warriors, hirpling across the desert with their spears pointing of the mysterious curve of the horn of the wildebeest and of the water buffalo, of the veiled gaze of a red-nostriled mandrill monkey. It is so exciting that, one by one, the dogs overleap their back gates, which used to be impossible, but now seems ridiculously easy. There goes Ginger and Patches and Blueberry and Rusty and Boots and Flipper! SANDRA TSING LOH: "Come, you dogs. Come, you doggies. Come, you dogs. Come on. And Joey! And Joey." SANDRA TSING LOH: And Joey, who at this humiliating moment cannot quite get his lardy, overweight body, stuffed full of too many Cheetos and Doritos quite over that back gate.
