It was good. It was nice, because I haven't seen him for probably about three months, maybe. IRA GLASS: So you've liked him for a long time. You just haven't been seeing him. You haven't been going out or anything for a long time. CLAUDIA PEREZ: No, nothing like that. And I've seen him, and I was happy. I was real happy to have seen him. I thought, oh, good. I got a nice present. To me, that was a good present. IRA GLASS: Just to see him. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Yeah. And then two days later, I see him at the mall with another girl. And I guess to me, that was a sign to finally let go. And I wanted to cry, but it was just, like, there's no more tears left. I've learned to take the pain of being let down by him. I still think about him, but when he calls me, I'm not going to jump to it no more. I know it's not forever. IRA GLASS: You've been waiting a long time. CLAUDIA PEREZ: A long time. IRA GLASS: How long? CLAUDIA PEREZ: Three to four years. It's going to be four years.
