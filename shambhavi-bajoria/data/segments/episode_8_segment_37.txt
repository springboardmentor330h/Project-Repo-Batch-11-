Let me ask you to talk about some of that tape. Let's play a little bit of that. LAURA FINNEGAN: OK. One of the people that I interviewed was a gentleman named Richard Jennifer. He's in his late 60's now, and he was an engineer for a subsidiary of the New York Times. He started working for the New York Times in the early '50s. RICHARD JENNIFER: Race was not really a real concern, because we all tended to go around, pal around, play around with each other on our off hours, as well as our working days. LAURA FINNEGAN: The interesting part about talking to Richard was that I learned his employer went to pretty great lengths to ensure that he was able to perform his job without the usual racial barriers impeding his ability to work. RICHARD JENNIFER: I was beginning to travel quite a bit and beginning to fly quite a bit.
