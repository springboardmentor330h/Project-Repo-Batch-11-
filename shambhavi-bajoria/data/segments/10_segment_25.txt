Am I right? IRA GLASS: How old are your children? JERRY WALTERS: They're in their 20's. They're girls. IRA GLASS: Hm. Well, what is your assessment of what's going on? Do you think that they know, but they choose not to ask consciously? JERRY WALTERS: Yes. IRA GLASS: And it's a conscious choice? JERRY WALTERS: Yes. I think it's very much a conscious choice. I think that they accept me for who I am. And I don't think they want to know a whole lot more about it. IRA GLASS: But you're saying they accept you for who you are, but they don't actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them. JERRY WALTERS: I am who my children see.
