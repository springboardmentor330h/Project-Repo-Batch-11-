DUKI: Long time no see. IRA GLASS: Long time no see, back at you. And welcome to our little radio program. DUKI: So what's going on here? You got a whole bunch of celebrities on tonight? IRA GLASS: Well, we actually have a number of different people? DUKI: Real celebs, like, Tom Cruise? DUKI: IRA GLASS: They're just like Tom Cruise, yes. Yeah. Now, Duki, I was talking to Danielle for our radio program and had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn't like, you could pretty much control her with something called "nose squeaks."
