Can I send it to three magazines? PLAYING WOMAN 1: Is it all right to turn in a manuscript written in blood or semen? PLAYING TEACHER: Typed, double spaced, unless it's written for one of the many handwriting analysis or calligraphy magazines. PLAYING WOMAN 1: Do 'zines count? PLAYING IRISH STUDENT: Is justifiable political manslaughter acceptable in a Christmas story? PLAYING GENE LARKIN: It was a great class. Everyone was really into it.

Like a lot of us, I love to write but often have to wait for an office party or a rowdy Presbyterian funeral for the mood to hit me. The teacher though, he explained how those same feelings of jubilation or sorrow can be reproduced through drugs and alcohol or tossing a hard, cold body into a shallow grave. PLAYING IRISH STUDENT: The grave part, it's like you reached in and pulled the thoughts out of my very heart.
