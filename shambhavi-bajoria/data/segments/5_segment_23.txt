I apologize for being taller than the person sitting behind me. I apologize for being smaller than the person sitting in front of me. LARRY STEEGER: I relinquish nothing and everything in order to stand here before you. And this I apologize for. I do not believe that this will allow me to enter into any new situation without the remembrance of what I've done. I only wish for you to hear me. I apologize for this also. I'm sorry. LARRY STEEGER: I have brought shame on my family. I've caused anguish, hurt, pain, and suffering in other families. I've done things which should not have been done. Without naming names, I have provoked, qualified, justified, revoked, interred, summoned, questioned, realized, created, allowed, returned, configured, situated, and muted things I should not have. LARRY STEEGER: I will allow for a return of the things that I have taken.
