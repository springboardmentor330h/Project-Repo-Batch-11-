She knows the marriage works for them and simply doesn't want to have to put up with the opinions of people who won't understand. And they do have a sex life, Jerry says, of a sort. IRA GLASS: Are you as sexually attracted to women as you are to men? IRA GLASS: nan JERRY WALTERS: No. We don't depend on each other for our sexual satisfaction. I don't know if I should go into that or not. Probably not. Masturbation is something that is part of what we do for sexual satisfaction. And however you do it, it's satisfying. IRA GLASS: Does she see other men? JERRY WALTERS: No. She says that's not what I'm about. IRA GLASS: We talked for two hours.
