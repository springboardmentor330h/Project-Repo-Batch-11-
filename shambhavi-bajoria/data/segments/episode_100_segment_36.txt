You know, Mike, that's never happened to me. Oh, me neither. Well, you're married. I'm not. No wife would ever hit me because it would have to be somebody else's wife, and I don't make friends with other people's wives. I can't remember if I've been hit by somebody else. Oh, you can. Come on. That was a very serious story-- Yes, it was. --but we sort of made a little light of it at the end. And we're sort of informal here on our little radio station, and we hope you don't mind it. "Informal" is not quite the right word. The right word is "surreal."
