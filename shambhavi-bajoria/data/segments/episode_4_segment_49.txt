Get back here. I was only joking. Hey, you-- hey, it's not even loaded. Look." He pulled the trigger, and the gun made a puny clicking noise. "Come on out. Hey, kid, I swear, I was only joking."

The first two cars just missed hitting me, but the third pulled over. Three students headed to Cleveland for an upcoming concert.
