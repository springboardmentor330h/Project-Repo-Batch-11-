IRA GLASS: Listen, can I record a quick conversation with you about something? SHIRLEY GLASS: What about? IRA GLASS: Well, you know the new show goes on the air this week. And as part of the show, we were thinking about having me call around to different people and get advice from them. And I wanted to know if you would have any advice. SHIRLEY GLASS: Hm. Do I have any advice? Well, can I ask another question? IRA GLASS: Sure. SHIRLEY GLASS: Who is your target audience? IRA GLASS: You are such a pro.
