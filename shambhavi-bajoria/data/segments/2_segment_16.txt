K-RAD: What? MR. WAREZ: Your computer will come first. FRED: Jesus Christ, man. I want to get a gun and shoot you. K-RAD: All right, after your computer. IRA GLASS: The thing about a bad conscience is that it splits you in half. And Fred said that he had two different modes. That was the word he used, "modes." He said that sometimes he would think about what they were doing. And he knew it was wrong, and it would bother him. But mostly, he tried not to think about it. FRED: My worst fear is that I can end up going to hell for doing this. And that's my worst fear. IRA GLASS: Do you believe in hell? FRED: Yeah, I do.
