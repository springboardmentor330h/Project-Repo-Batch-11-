BENTON HARBOR: 1:40 PM. I go see the police commissioner and share with him the doctor's diagnosis. After all, he is my closest friend. And if I can't tell him the bad news, who can I tell? So I give him a new coloring book I bought for him and tell him my sad news. And he says-- POLICE COMMISSIONER: Ha, ha. This looks like a real neat coloring book. BENTON HARBOR: So what do you think commissioner? POLICE COMMISSIONER: About what? BENTON HARBOR: What I just shared with you. POLICE COMMISSIONER: Oh. It's a real neat coloring book. BENTON HARBOR: About the diagnosis and the need to alter my lifestyle. POLICE COMMISSIONER: Oh. Well, that would mean that you'd have to-- and of course one can't even be sure that that, you know. So anyway, that's how I see it.
