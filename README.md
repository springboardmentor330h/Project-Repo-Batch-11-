# Castly: Automated Podcast Transcription & Topic Segmentation
*Turn hours of audio into minutes of insight*

## 1. Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Podcasts are long-form audio content (often 30–120 minutes) with valuable insights scattered throughout. Listeners waste significant time searching for specific topics, quotes, or segments. Manual transcription and note-taking are inefficient, and existing tools lack intelligent segmentation and navigation.

### Objectives:
The primary objectives of Castly are:
   - Automatically transcribe podcast audio.
   - Detect the spoken language.
   - Segment transcripts into coherent topic blocks.
   - Generate summaries and keywords for each segment.
   - Perform sentiment analysis.
   - Provide an interactive UI for search and navigation.
   - Support multilingual audio with romanization.

### Significance & Applications
Castly has practical applications in:
   - **Education & Learning**: Students/researchers quickly find relevant sections in educational podcasts.
   - **Accessibility**: Transcripts + summaries aid hearing-impaired users or non-native speakers.
   - **Media & Journalism**: Content creators analyze discussion trends, sentiment, and key moments.
   - **Research**: NLP researchers use segmented transcripts for topic modeling, summarization, or discourse analysis.
   - **Productivity**: Professionals save hours by jumping directly to relevant podcast moments.

## 2. Dataset Description

### Source of the Dataset
[This American Life Podcast Transcript Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/this-american-life-podcast-transcript-dataset)

### Type of Audio Files Used
   - MP3 (raw), converted to WAV for processing.
   - MP3 (most common), WAV, M4A, OGG (supported via file uploader).

### Number of Podcast Samples
200 podcast episodes (subset of ~600+ available).

### Preprocessing Steps Undertaken
   - Audio trimming (optional quick demo: first 10 minutes only)
   - Loudness Normalization: Used pyloudnorm 
   - Format conversion: (MP3 → WAV, 16kHz)
   - Noise removal / enhancement: Used noisereduce
   - Metadata extraction: Title (from ID3 tags or filename), cover image (embedded APIC frame)
   - Temporary file conversion for Whisper compatibility.
   - Sentence tokenization using NLTK.
   - Stopword removal for keyword extraction.

   # Activate: audio_project_env\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source audio_project_env/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **GPU Setup** (optional, recommended for faster Whisper processing):
   - Install CUDA 11.8+ if you have an NVIDIA GPU

   ```python
   import whisper
   import librosa
   print("Setup complete!")
   ```

6. **File Organization**:
   - Raw audio: `data/audio_raw/`
   - Processed audio: `data/audio_processed/`
   - Transcripts: `data/transcripts_processed/`
   - Notebooks: `notebooks/` directory
   - Modular Streamlit app: `data/app/podcast_navigator.py` and `data/app/pages/`

7. **Run the Modular Web App (Week 7+)**:

## 10. Limitations

- Occasional transcription inaccuracies (especially with noisy or low-quality audio)
- Imperfect topic segmentation for highly conversational or overlapping speech
- Dependence on Whisper's language detection and model accuracy
- Sentiment analysis is basic (VADER, English-centric)
- Romanization may not be perfect for all languages/scripts

## 11. Future Work

- Integrate improved speech recognition models (e.g., Whisper large-v3, hybrid ASR)
- Speaker identification and diarization
- Advanced UI features: segment editing, export, and analytics dashboard
- Enhanced multilingual support and custom romanization rules
- Add advanced UI features (bookmarking, sharing segments, dark mode refinements)
