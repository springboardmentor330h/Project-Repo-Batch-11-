We're all trying to make sense of it and it ain't easy that much we know. We're trying to make sense of this together. In the way, the only way that we know how, which is by having wise humans coming on, talking to each other, listening to each other, trying to learn from each other. We are apart, but we can use this moment to build community together and that's what we're trying to do."

I'd like to welcome to join you. My co-host here, Whitney Pennington Rogers. She's our current affairs curator. We're going to be looking a little bit at China's response today when news surfaced about a strange viral outbreak in Wuhan, China at the very last days of 2019."

We watched the situation in China quickly worsen and in the most recent weeks dramatically improve. And I think as all of us around the world grapple with how we can contain and control the spread of COVID-19, there are a lot of lessons we can learn from what China experienced and how they responded. So we're really thrilled to be joined today by the CEO of the South China Morning Post, Gary Lou, who's here to share his perspective and insights. So welcome Gary."

So over the course of the last week plus and likely for at least another week plus, the entire organization has been distributed and working from home. You know, when Hong Kong got its first confirmed case, I was actually back in the United States with my wife. We were taking a small break in the Rockies. And we came back to Hong Kong pretty soon after that to make sure we got back into Hong Kong before the airport shut. At that point, it was all of our family in the United States and friends texting us and worrying about how things were in Hong Kong as the situation in China started escalating. And people were sending us or trying to send us supplies, masks and sanitizing stuff like that."

And we are seeing our friends and our family back home in New York and California and checking in on them, trying to send equipment and materials back to them. So the script is flipped actually pretty fast over the last couple of weeks. And you know, I think that's actually a really interesting place to start and probably a question that a lot of people who aren't in China have, you know, I think from the outside looking in, it seems as if what's happened in China is kind of miraculous that to go from, you know, you have a country with more than a billion people there to go from as many as 80,000 cases to nearly to nearly zero new cases now. You know, what can you tell us about how this happened to help us understand the current situation and just really how China ended up there? Yeah, a lot has happened China's been dealing with this for several months now several months has stuck that's not a good thing."

    "text": "But they have gone through several different phases. I think when he before I jump into it, there are a couple of caveats that are really important to make. The first one is that we're still parsing what happened in China. The information system as everyone knows is still relatively closed. And so a lot of the information that we're using to piece together what happened in China is still not fully complete. And so with every passing day, every passing week is more information that allows us to retroactively make sure that we get the picture of what happened early on in those early days at the end of 2019, get that picture right. And there's still a lot of that's happening today, even though I think the information sharing is as much more open than it was early on. There's still a lot of stuff that we need to parse. And the second important caveat here is that I think learning sometimes suggests that everything China did was was right and good and hopefully other countries can can can take it and apply it. But that's not 100% the case China of course did a lot that was right and if we walked through the timeline, I think it'll be pretty apparent. The decisions that they made that kept the coronavirus from really exploding across the entire country and really limited it to one province and mostly one city. But there were also many, many missteps and those are things that I think the world can also learn from most importantly China should learn from because most of these these what I think those of us who are professional observers would call missteps are because they're systemic issues with the country because of governance, lack of knowledge. And governance lack of free information flow stuff like that. So those are the initial caveats, but I think the timing of how China progressed from first case to now has been has been fascinating. Yeah, I mean, and so we know now that and in who they province they've lifted officially lifted the two month lockdown and are you getting the sense do you feel like this is the right decision to make at this moment."

Wuhan itself, which was the where the pandemic started was the first epicenter and the major epicenter. Wuhan is opening up in April 8th. That's right now the schedule. And this is really what we're in now is a third of three phases from the first discovery of the virus and Wuhan. Now April 8th will be about 11 weeks after Wuhan, the city got completely shut down and the who they province got shut down. And so for those who are in shelter at home kind of situations right now in the United States and wondering how long this is going to take in Wuhan, they've been they've been locked down for 11 weeks. And only now has the Chinese government decided they're ready to start letting people move freely around. And to your point earlier about some of possible missteps in terms of reporting, I mean, there's still reports now that we might not be getting the an accurate number of cases that we're seeing in Wuhan or beyond that we're hearing some people say there are no new cases other people saying that there actually are cases. Do you feel like there is accurate spread of information about the current state of the virus in China right now?"

And this is one of the problems right now that even the World Health Organization is struggling with is that the definition of what is a confirmed case, what is an infection is different from country to country. As an example in China, the folks that have tested positive but are asymptomatic, we understand now that they are not included since February 7th, they have not been included in the official numbers or the very least on February 7th, they change that definition and they're not included in those official numbers. So, should be another 50% on top of the numbers that we're seeing today. So, what we've found, our reporters have gone their hands on some classified government documents and government data that suggests that a third of total actual positive tests are asymptomatic and therefore not included in official numbers. Now, I don't think that this is an example of the Chinese government trying to hide information. This is a definitions issue which countries have been debating and people are doing it in different ways."

We are in the third phase that I would call recovery and rehabilitation, rehabilitation being the rehabilitation of China's image. But the first part was discovery and a lot of denial and then there was this two and a half month period of response and containment. And that I think the response and containment part is what is most interesting to the rest of the world. And so, maybe we can break some of that down. Thinking about China's response, what were some of the specific things that you think China did right both as a nation, individuals in the country?"

    "text": "The first time we heard about the coronavirus, this mysterious respiratory disease that looked somewhat like SARS was on December 30th. That was the day that there's a doctor that is now, his name is known all over the world for the unfortunate reason that he ended up eventually dying, namely Wenliang. And Lee Wenliang, Dr. Lee posted to a private WeChat group on December 30th. These were some of his old classmates from med school. And he said, hey, I'm in Wuhan. I'm at the hospital. There is a SARS-like illness, SARS being the epidemic from 2002 to 2003. There's a SARS-like illness that is spreading through these hospitals in Wuhan. A private message, somebody forwarded and it went viral across the Chinese internet. That was the first time we actually heard about something that was going on in Wuhan. The very next day, December 31st, was the first time that any Chinese officials, and on that day, it happened to be the actual provincial and the city officials acknowledged that there were 27 people at that moment in time who had been diagnosed with this mysterious pneumonia and they reported the cases to the World Health Organization. That was also the day that Dr. Lee was reprimanded, officially reprimanded. So that was really the discovery, the end of the discovery and denial phase, because what we know now is that back to mid-December, several weeks before Dr. Lee wrote his blog post, the authorities had already been notified that a SARS-like pneumonia was showing up in Wuhan hospitals and action had already started down the chain of authority. They have now backdated, at least publicly backdated, the first case to December 1st, but actually in their confidential and classified government documents that again our journalists have seen, we've published a story. Officially, in classified documents, they backdated the first COVID-19 case all the way back to November 17th, as the earliest example that they can find based on symptoms and based on retroactive diagnosis for a COVID-19 case. So in effect, there were several weeks before the acknowledgement of the World Health Organization that was going on, and the first case with symptoms was actually identified about a month and a half before that notice to World Health Organization. Then the second phase, which really started, let's say, December 31st when the acknowledgement happened, was response and then massive containment."

So on January 1st, the World Health Organization started working with China on trying to identify the virus and trying to figure out a course of action. It wasn't until several weeks later that Beijing, the central government for the first time, broke its silence and that was on January 18th. And actually, they broke the silence to deny that this was SARS and in fact to a quote-unquote defy rumors that were spreading around the Chinese Internet. But there was a major date that happened two days afterwards, which was January 20th. Because for the first time, a member of the party and a senior government official who is now one of the central gentlemen that is actually leading the task force against COVID-19, his name is Donan San, he's an epidemiologist, he's one of the central figures during SARS 17 years ago."

Now this is important because prior to that, officials who had spoken up had said that human to human transmission was not likely, was not possible. And you know, previous to that, all of the cases, the majority of the cases were tied to this seafood and wildlife marketplace that was in the city of Wuhan. But now, on January 20th, human to human transmission, it's possible, it's happening. And so, of course, the course of action, not only in China, but the course of action all over the world started to change. And three days after that, Wuhan was locked out. It was completely, you know, it shocked the world that they could lock down that many people. So, quickly, of course, now India, yesterday, it now is at 1.3 billion people are being locked down."

And then the end of this middle second phase, I think really came around March 10th, actually on March 10th, I could say, because Chinese Presidency, Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan. And these things in Chinese politics, because everything is so well choreographed, matters a whole lot. The fact that Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, signaled that the Chinese government believed the worst was over. The reality was that probably about 20 days before that, the curve had already been flattened. So, 20 days before that, probably around February 20th, the infection rate was around 75,000, 76,000."

So, I mean, if I'm hearing correctly, thank you, and thank you for sharing all of that. It sounds like, although there was a slow period of getting the information out initially, eventually there was quick reaction from the Chinese government to respond to this, lock folks down.

It's just people traveling all over the country. 400 million people traveling. Now, Wuhan is one of the most important cities in China. Although, before this, I don't think anyone, not a lot of people around the world knew the city of Wuhan, but it's extremely important. It is considered the most important city in the center of China for many different reasons, but one of the key reasons is that it is one of the key transportation hubs of the country. So all of the major train lines, the high speed train lines and normal train lines, the trade lines, they all kind of converge on Wuhan. So you can imagine if 400 million people start moving around, for Chinese New Year on January 24th, a huge number of them were going to go through Wuhan. But of course, Wuhan itself is an 11 million person city. The surrounding cities all added together, Kubei Province, has about 60 million people, and they were also largely going to travel. And so if January 23rd, they had not shut it down, and people had started traveling, the likelihood would have been that this would have been really, really hard, possibly, likely impossible to contain. Even though they shut down before the Chinese New Year holiday started, we now also know that at least 5 million people actually left the surrounding areas and traveled, which is one of the reasons why it did spread a little bit across the country and then eventually spread to other parts of the world. And I'd like to come back to that as well, just thinking about the 5 million people who left and sort of where they landed today and how that affected things."

    "text": "But before we do that, I'm interested to even talk with you a little bit more about, you know, you mentioned this November date as one of the earliest cases you discovered that was reported was in November. And that's something actually that I hadn't heard before, and I imagine that might be news to a lot of people hearing this. And so I'm curious when you think about the missteps from China's perspective in terms of what China did, you know, there is, as you mentioned, suppression of information is one thing, one major criticism. Of how China handled this and hearing that maybe there was knowledge of something as early as November, if that might have played a role in and how we were able to control and contain this a lot sooner. I do want to clarify, I think from what we understand, officials were not notified about this until mid December. So it wasn't, so it was really a couple of weeks before between officials realizing that there was a SARS-like pneumonia going around to when the first case was reported to World Health Organization. It wasn't all the way back to November 17. That was retroactively backdated, but that has not been made public by the government. We published it because we've seen the data that actually back dates the first case. From a misstep point of view, again, it's a couple of weeks compared to what happened in SARS, which was a long time of locking down on information. This was much shorter, the period of time that the government was in complete shutdown mode. But then after that, of course, there was still continued censorship on the internet, especially within the Great Firewall of China for communications between Chinese citizens. And, you know, surprisingly, to some, I think for a lot of China watchers, not so surprisingly, is that the government has over the course of the central government over the course of the last several weeks."

They actually, they now refer to him as a national hero. They have officially removed the reprimand.

And as they're coming back, a lot of them are actually bringing the virus back with them. And so we're starting to see a spike.

Is it possible in mainland China that because of this redefinition that you spoke about where if someone tests positive, but they're not showing symptoms, that is not reported as a case. That seems significant to me. Is that part of the explanation for why new reports have gone nearly to zero? I don't know if that's the answer to it, but I do actually think that even with, and remember, these are folks that are tested. So the data that we have is that these folks have been tested. The tests have come back positive, but have not been added to the official number of infections because they're asymptomatic. But they have still gone through the process that is part of China's containment strategy, which has worked extraordinarily well, which is, first of all, lots and lots of people have been tested. And then once, if there is a positive test return, regardless of whether or not it's symptomatic or asymptomatic, regardless of whether or not they're added to official numbers, what happens next is that they are quarantined, they're isolated, and contact tracing happens. And so they go and figure out where this person has been moving, where they've been, who they've been in contact with, and all those folks that they've been in contact with, close contact with, they get tested. And if they come back with a positive test, then they're also isolated, and they go through the process again. So China has not been testing people, finding that they're asymptomatic, and then just releasing them, and letting them go home."

When you look at what's happening in other parts of the world, you hear in the United States where Chris and I are based right now, you were hearing that people who are experiencing symptoms, have symptoms, cannot get tested. How does China's ability to test so many people affect the way that they can respond to this and control this virus? It really matters. Without the significant testing and without the contact tracing that comes afterwards, I don't think there's a way that China could have contained it the way that they did."

I think by far the highest for capital testing anywhere in the world, as far as we know right now, and they aggressively did contact tracing. Because of that, even though South Korea had this huge spike and we thought that it was going to get out of hand, they were able to suppress it, control it, and now they're in a much, much better place. One thing you mentioned earlier that I'd love to talk about too is SARS and the impact that going through that in 2002 and 2003 for China, other countries in Asia and Hong Kong. What affected that having on everyone's of preparedness in that part of the world for the COVID-19 outbreak?"

I think the institutional and social memory of SARS matters a heck of a lot when you look at how China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, a lot of these countries in Asia have dealt with COVID-19. Let me use Hong Kong as an example because it's the one that I know most intimately, but a lot of what I'm about to say actually does apply to those other areas of Asia. So for context, SARS, November 2002, July 2003, very, very similar coronavirus to COVID-19, I think there's about an 80% similarity to those two viruses. The global infected number was a little over 8,774 deaths. So by percentage, deadlier than COVID-19 is, but far less infectious than COVID-19 is. Now, here's why it impacted Hong Kong so much and why the memory is so deep and actually tells you a lot about Hong Kong's reaction to COVID-19. Of the 8,000 infected, 22% were here in the city of 7.5 million and 40% actually 39% of the deaths, 299 people died in Hong Kong. 39% of the global deaths happened in Hong Kong. And SARS did not start in Hong Kong. It was imported into Hong Kong from southern China. And so SARS, again, deep, deep memory, but it was a massive turning point in the Hong Kong healthcare system and also the social practices of the city. And let me walk through some of that impact because you can actually still see it even before COVID-19, you see it every day. The healthcare system was able to really very quickly ramp up in capacity because of preparation post-SARS. So after SARS, Hong Kong healthcare authorities started preparing for greater capacity, especially for infectious diseases."

I can tell you that a lot of folks that were here before SARS will tell you that in Hong Kong hospitals, before SARS, it was actually rare to see even medical professionals wear face masks. And so, the more surgical masks are ubiquitous, not only in hospitals, but across the entire city, anytime anywhere it seems, especially right now. New channels of communication and data and information exchange were opened up with mainland Chinese authorities. And technology was implemented, including now a supercomputer that actually does contact tracing in Hong Kong. The existence of the supercomputer and this contact tracing ability back to changes that happen post-SARS."

I know that the World Health Organization, as well as governments like the US, as well as Singapore, say that only medical personnel, as well as people who are actually sick and showing symptoms, need to be wearing masks. In Hong Kong, everyone wears masks. And the government, even though they flopped a little bit in this epidemic, the general, the guidance is that everyone should be wearing masks."

And so generally speaking, even outside of the pandemic, when people are sick and coughing, you'll see them wear masks out in public. On top of that, there was, it became systemic, or I should say, systematic controls for hygiene and social and public spaces. So if you visit Hong Kong, again, before all of this happened, you will have noticed that public spaces are constantly being disinfected. One good example that everyone notices is that when you go into an elevator and public spaces and buildings, they will either have one of two things potentially both."

And one of the most famous things about Hong Kong dim sum are the dim sum carts, which are also a very popular in New York, Chinatown as an example. Those dim sum carts, they pretty much went away after SARS. And so most dim sum restaurants that you'll go to in Hong Kong now, the vast majority of them, you have to order off of a menu. You don't have public carts going around because of hygiene issues. And most nice Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong now, you will get, when you sit down, two pairs of chopsticks per person."

And honestly, there are hand sanitizers and hand washing notices literally everywhere. And this is just part of the social behavior after SARS. Safety protocols and offices, everyone knows how to shut down an office and control traffic really well. Most major offices have temperature check machines at the very least available. And then of course social distancing. People understand social distancing is important. And so the moment there was fear of what was happening across the border, naturally people started social distancing activities and self quarantine became pretty, pretty normal. So those are all the social things as well as the health system things that kind of changed. And because of that, Hong Kong was able to react really, really fast, not just the government, not just the health authorities, but the people of Hong Kong. And I think that's the most important part is that the entire city, that the community reacted and went into this mode where you wore masks, you washed your hands, you carried hand sanitizers, you stopped going to public places."

And from where you sit and when you see what's going on in other parts of the world, where maybe people are struggling to make some of these these changes. What are some of the specific things you think folks can adapt in their own cultures in their own countries? I think communication is a huge deal. If you talk to local Hong Kongers, they will likely apply that the communication from the Hong Kong government has not been top notch. But thankfully, there have been other authorities and certainly even just person to person communication has been pretty strong. A lot of corporates have done an incredible job in Hong Kong and communicating very transparently with their employees and insurance companies have also been making available all sorts of webinars and materials and made it actually quite easy for people to understand how to get tested, where to get tested, who to get tested. And so that communication I think has centralized to some degree the messaging in a city like Hong Kong, everyone generally believes the same thing and what they believe is generally true. Of course, there's still misinformation issues as there are everywhere."

So I think communication is really important from government, from corporates anywhere in the world. I think if there is a recommendation for health systems, I know getting tests is really difficult. One of the things that has made testing in China and Hong Kong is certainly so effective is that there is point of care testing that still really doesn't exist or at least doesn't exist in volume in the US. So they have to save these tests and only a certain number of people can get tested."

Now China is very prepared for this because the technology stack in China, including consumer side services. Make it really easy to lock your doors and get everything delivered to you. This is infrastructure and this is consumer behavior that is already ingrained in especially in major cities across China. So people just went home. There was also stigma issue, which is unfortunate for people from Hu Bay and especially from Wuhan. But there are plenty of stories in the other major Chinese cities where anyone coming from Hu Bay or with any connection to Wuhan were ostracized during those early days, especially after the Wuhan lockdown. And so folks that might have been in fact carrying the virus because they were from the epicenter, they were either self quarantine or there are forcibly quarantined because no one was going to spend time with them anyway. So I think for a lot of those reasons, some of them social, some of them systemic, they made it so that there was much less people, a person to person contact, especially after the authorities admitted that human transmission was possible."

For people who don't have cars and many, many of the Wuhan residents don't have cars, if the buses are locked down, then they might have to walk three, four hours to get to a hospital. Maybe not that long, but they have to walk a long way to get to a hospital. And so a lot of people were just stuck at home and they were unable to initially get any diagnosis or any health care.

I think most people have heard now that there were two massive hospitals with thousands of beds of capacity that were built within 10 days. And this is true. They came out of nowhere. They're literally just parking lots or flat ground and two major housing hospital units were built up. To be clear, also, those were the triage units for those who have very mild symptoms."

Being able to get people with mild symptoms out of the major hospital systems so that they're not taking up the resources of nurses and doctors, they're not taking up the diagnostic equipment for the second confirmation tests. And also, especially, they're not taking up isolation awards and ventilators. And so the moment people started being moved out the mild symptoms, the ones that were going to survive and they just really needed to be separate from family and have some antiviral medication. Once they're moved out into these new hospitals, the main hospitals in Wuhan and across Wubae could deal with the primary patients, especially those that are critical of the overall test of population and do their best to try and save them. And make sure that they're not highly infectious. At the same time, I think that the health authorities in China, especially the nurses and the doctors, did a very good job of also protecting themselves. So there have been far fewer by percentage infections and deaths of medical staff in their work in SARS."

I mean, you're well aware of the cultural differences between China, Hong Kong and the West. How do you rate the chances of, say, the US responding effectively should things really explode here as they seem like they may be about to. In the health care system side, I have every confidence that the US health care system is going to be able to respond well. I have many, many friends who are medical professionals in the United States and they are raising their hands and volunteering and going to hospitals to see where they can help. So I have full trust in the system and the people that man those systems out of capacity in the United States is also significantly greater doctors per capita than in China. And because of the fact that also our health care system is not just relying on hospitals, but their primary care physicians scattered all over the country. As long as a testing capacity and testing kits are available across the country, general practitioners can actually administer those and it certainly sounds like more and more med tech startups in the US are now trying to create these home kits so that people can start testing at home."

Take it seriously and stay home and don't go to public spaces and don't be a carrier because we now know that asymptomatic folks can be carriers and there is a possibility that you can be infectious as an asymptomatic carrier. So on the cultural side, I don't think it's really cultural. I would say that it's because of the impact of SARS. It's because of the social memory of SARS that has meant people are a little bit more selfless and I just said, okay, I will stay home because I might have come in contact.

Well, running a news organization in the moment like they're so close to the initial epicenter and where the outbreak started is complicated. We were lucky. We're very, very lucky that most of our senior editors and certainly the most senior editors are editor in chief on mass head leadership. They were all journalists and there were reporters during SARS. So there's a lot of pattern recognition and on newsroom, which meant the moment that we got the first sort of the first stories coming out of China starting on December 30th, people already raising their hands in the newsroom saying, hey, we got a report about this like if it's going to be the next SARS."

Partially to make sure we got the story right to dig deeper in the places that we knew we had to dig deeper, but also to protect our journalists and employees. So one of the things that we did do and maybe other news organizations would disagree with our decision was was I think in late January or early February, even in Hong Kong, we said to our journalists, you are not to go into hospital. So no more in hospital reporting because they were it was we knew that it was highly infectious. We were worried that they were going to become points of spread and we just wanted to protect our employees and our company. So we did that. We also had a business continuity plan, which meant that at the drop of a dime, we could shut down the entire office and still operate this global news business.

Yeah, I think probably the two most interesting changes actually actually say three.

And so online education very, very quickly moved online and part of that move online was that courses had to be and classes had to be recorded which means that now there's this huge repository of recorded classes that means potential democratization of education material and significantly lower costs to get this type of coursework from the top tier schools whether it's high schools universities or primary schools. To the entire country now whether not China activates on it we're still not sure but the potential is there the second major shift is really on distributed workforce the idea of working remotely. It office work remotely is not much of a concept in China and across most of ages certainly far less than in the United States and I'm from the US tech industry so it was pretty normal. It's pretty normal in the US tech industry even before this in China much less so but because of the lockdowns not only in who they but across China this has become much more normal and people are kind of falling into a different rhythm of work and most importantly this is given rise to a whole new set of teleconferencing companies in China because most of the teleconferencing companies that we know of in the west whether it's the Cisco systems Google Hangouts zoom that everyone uses blue jeans slack video they're not available in China they don't work in China there is this mirror internet in China behind the great firewall and so there's a whole new set of teleconferencing systems that were used but were not really commonplace certainly not for distributed workforce and now suddenly over the last few months there are so be interesting to see how those companies and those services develop and whether or not the work is available in China. And then finally the third thing that is really interesting is that there was a huge internet response to this censorship issue in China over the course of the last two months. Especially exploded after this whistleblower Dr. Lee died on February 7th all over the Chinese internet hashtags like we want freedom of speech national hero Dr. Lee things like that just exploded everywhere and they've been and actually the Chinese government has had to respond I think for observers a lot of observers believe that China Chinese governments change a narrative about Dr. Lee was largely driven by this reaction from the from its citizens across the internet. They have been extremely creative examples how people getting around censorship I think China is quite famous for using emojis to get around tech censorship I think most people also know that the primary messaging app that the Chinese internet users use called we chat it is heavily censored it's not just texts that censored images and censored really effectively individual conversations are censored and so when there are specific articles or specific posts that are are not going to be about what's happening with the virus that people want to share and the government thinks that it is detrimental to whatever they will censor and will be completely and very effectively removed. But this time around Chinese citizens used emojis again they translated these these posts into ancient Chinese texts that the the sensory machines couldn't pick up yet they actually translated one version of this post to into topical media."

I do think that there is going to be an increased call academics now are speaking up about freedom of speech so there's going to be this increased volume of of of netizens calling for freedom speech will be very very interesting to watch how the authorities in China deal with that. Great and Chris you have a question. Yeah it sort of picks up on that about the you know the stories that could come out of this I mean there are definitely optimistic stories that people are feeling that you know this could lead to more free speech of a certain kind in in China certain things you can't suppress. Maybe in the in the US it might lead to the government taking scientific predictions more seriously not clear that's happening yet. And there's and there's hope that this whole thing because it's a common enemy for the world will actually bring the world together in some ways but I'm curious how you think about this like President Trump has started to referring to this as the Chinese virus I'm curious how that's being received in China and and how people are are feeling on this issue has it do you think it's increased sympathy for other countries are actually dialed up an amosti. Well it's certainly not being received well across China I think one one thing that is still really under covered is is the the the intensity of rising nationalism at the grassroots level across China over the last several years and they're very protective of the country and their people in their history and President Trump's comments and the fact that so much of the US government is now referring to this as the Chinese virus is is not received well. My fear of course is that even prior to the the virus the US China conflict was escalating beyond anything that I think most of us as observers want to see trade tech military ideology and now we can add information conflict and health conflict health health tech conflict especially to the list of course the hope is that that these height intentions will actually dissipate and that the two countries can actually see the actually at this moment in time choose to go down one of two paths either one that further damages the relationship or one that actually shows what the possibilities are of the two largest economies in the world the two most powerful countries in the world actually cooperate in this week Thursday is G20 conversations that are going to happen remotely it'll be interesting to see how US and China actually coordinate cooperate how they communicate during those talks."

Italy and we know what's happening in what happened in Italy and what's going on in Spain and the US is catching up on that spike and it's going to come much faster and it's going to be much higher than I think most people originally believed or hoped for so it will get worse so the hope is that again this is going to be the optimistic side of me that the nations will come together that those in charge governments will make the drastic necessary moves and that's going to be a great thing. And we will be able to come out on the other side faster than it looks right now remember when China went to shutdown on January 23rd there were only 830 confirmed cases and even if those numbers are not exactly accurate it's nowhere near the confirmed cases that we have in the US right now that we see in the US so that is something to be very very concerned about at 830 they shut down and even after the shutdown two weeks later the cases had grown to 35,000 to weeks after that it was at at 75,000 so at this point it is late in the US but we know that it can still be fixed and I think most most experts that we talk to believe that it can be fixed with with fast and decisive action. People struggle with understanding the power of exponential growth and a number can seem small-ish today but if you believe the science you have to act. Gary, look I hope somehow you will convey to whoever you can convey that regardless of what some people might say in government or elsewhere there are millions, there are tens of millions, there are probably hundreds of millions of people in the US on both right and left who are amazed by what happened in China you know yes missteps on whatever but they are amazed I mean it's you have really in both the Chinese government the Hong Kong government several Asian governments Singapore, South Korea have shown a astonishingly wise and disciplined action against this thing and we are grateful we feel there is much we can learn from you and so people most people want this to be a time of bringing the world together I genuinely believe that maybe the optimistic party me believing it but I believe in it it's partly what these conversations are for to try and make those kinds of connections so we want to keep in touch you have got an amazing seat there and I have loved listening to every word you said today here it's just I've learned so much from you so thank you for that That was a great conversation Thank you for your insight And thank you to our whole online audience I mean this is a journey every you know every day we're learning something new And just in case anyone out there is feeling a little bit powerless and afraid or you know at the situation I mean the one thing that everyone can do right now I think is we can reach out to the people we can know we can encourage each of us to be our best selves in this moment Like I really think it's so what the was going to need when people are angry and fearful we can turn into nasty people and but when we're when we realize how much we need each other And are willing to just reach out and share stories of hope and and share what we're feeling and share possibilities we can we can really impact each other and I see so many incredible instances of that from around the world Whether it's italians singing to each other joyfully from each other's balconies or these sort of tales of heroism that some of our health workers have been engaged in all all around the world there's going to need to be a lot more of that But honestly every single person to play a part in how they are online how what they share how they react so I don't want to be overly embarrassed and be like come by our but I kind of think we need that spirit right now a little bit We need each other and I'm just going to try and play that role a bit so if you hate that maybe you don't need to be here but I hope I hope you don't hate that I hope you like that and we'll be part of it Whitney is so fun coasting coasting these thanks to the rest of the amazing Ted team who are in there everyone in our individual homes sort of racing around trying to make this stuff work technically we're learning a bit each day I hope Thanks so much for being part of this thank you everyone thank you we'll see you all back here tomorrow PRX"
