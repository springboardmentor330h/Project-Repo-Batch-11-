It's a battle that's going on right inside our minds. I mean, if you're anything like me, you've had this real roller coaster of emotions. The last few days, weeks. This is scary. This is different.

We're again excited to have you. And I guess first and foremost, how are you doing? How are you holding up? Well, I think like everyone we're doing the best we can given the circumstances. My husband is a physician at MGH and it's really a stock reality when one week you're saying, you know, can you pick up groceries? And the next week you exchanging emergency contact information if something would have gone wrong. So, you know, we're all living this reality and I think trying to find the inner resources to do that in the best way we can is just a profound importance right now. So, thank you. Yeah, no, definitely. I'm glad to hear that you're managing and hanging in there. Your work is so focused around how we can best prepare ourselves emotionally and psychologically for these moments of change and complexity. And you have this really beautiful saying about life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility. What does that mean and how does that apply to the current moment where we're all experienced? Well, I think we all know this internally at some level that there is this complex and intimate beautiful relationship between the beauty of life and the fragility of life. We love and then we lose. We are healthy until we are ill. We in jobs in which we need it until those jobs are no longer. We might, you know, roll our eyes and yell at our kids and ask them to tidy their rooms and then one day there's silence where that child once was. They're now making their way in the world. And so there's this complex interplay between the beauty and the fragility of life that just is what makes the wholeness of life. And yet so often in our narratives in society, we talk about, you know, focusing on success and being positive all the time and goal setting and, you know, there's this whole even, even our avoidance that we have really, I think, at a very broad level in society, our avoidance of talking about what is the most common feature that all of us or common experience that all of us will go through, which is to die. And yet so much of our society is constructed around preventing avoidance denial of this reality. And, you know, the circumstance that we in now is not something that we asked for, but life is calling on every single one of us to move into the place of wisdom in ourselves beyond the thinking judgey county mind into the space of wisdom and fortitude and solidarity, community courage. And it's according for all of us right now that I think is just so emished in what is in our absolute undenough reality, the fragility of life right now."

    "transcript": "Thank you for that. And I mean, and I think that for a lot of us when we're thinking about how our lives have changed, you know, and we are approaching this idea of happiness, so many of the things at one point really did bring us a lot of joy being able to go out with friends and socialise and spend physical time with loved ones. So many of those things have changed. But, you know, I guess in this moment, how do you advise that we cultivate happiness and enjoy with everything that's going on? Well, so just to be clear firstly, I'm not anti-happiness, which you'll understand why I'm saying this as I progress. I think, though, that often again, we have this narrative in society that is about be happy and be positive. And whilst that may sound like it's the right thing and it sounds like that is the thing that we should all be saying, you know, just keep positive or, you know, when people are experiencing cancer, they're told to just be positive or when people are being marginalized or discriminated against to stop being so angry. You know, we have in our society this almost judgment that happiness and joy are the most important emotional experiences that we can have. And on the other hand, the so-called bad or negative emotions are frustration, anxiety, grief, loss, fear, sadness. And so what we do is we often become very comfortable with happiness and we become uncomfortable with those difficult emotions and we push them aside. But I think what so often happens when we try to pursue some idea of, well, going out was what made me happy or I can't go clubbing this weekend and now I can't be happy is what we're doing is we're basically establishing the anchor point of happiness around expectations or goals. And what we know actually when we look at the scientific literature is that when we overly strongly focus on happiness as a goal, we actually become less happy over time. And it's this really interesting paradox because it's we almost seeking something as opposed to just living our lives in a way that is compassionate and accepting. What I would say is that rather than trying to find happiness, I think now for all of us is actually a space for us to come into ourselves, to come into our emotions, to not try to brush away the grief or the loneliness or the anxiety, but to rather face into that."

He didn't try to build some false narrative between me and reality. What he said to me is, do see, it's normal to be scared. We all die and it's normal to be scared. And what we need to do is we need to not try to do away with fear, but rather to reach inside ourselves and to find the courage. And I think that is a message for our times, which is not to try rush aside or belittle or judge yourself if you're experiencing difficult emotions. This is a tough time. But rather if we can use strategies to enable us to be with those emotions in healthy ways, which is the whole foundational experience of what I call emotional agility, this is ultimately what will enable us to bring the best of ourselves forward in every aspect of how we love and how we lead in these times, are we parent and how we come to ourselves. And I think that that's exactly what we'd love to hear more about is this emotional agility that you just referenced. Maybe just first start there. What is emotional agility? What are the main tenets of this philosophy? Well, the first part of emotional agility, which is really critical, is moving away from I think what so many of us have I did some research where I was asking people, you know, when you have difficulty emotional experiences, what do you tend to do with them? And I did surveys of around 70,000 people. And what I found is that a large majority of us maybe driven by this narrative of, oh, I've got to be happy and positive all the time, what we tend to do when we have these difficulty emotional experiences is we do, we judge them, we've been little them, we push them aside, or we get stuck in them. So the language that I use as we often bottle our emotions, we rationalize them and we push them aside, or we brood on them and we get stuck in them. And what emotional agility is, and I can talk about this, you know, in terms of its principles, but also its strategies in more detail, but really what emotional agility is, it's the ability to be with ourselves. Our full selves are full emotional experience in ways that are compassionate because the system tough and these emotions are real. So we need to be compassionate with ourselves and others. We need to be curious, you know, what is my frustration telling me about what's important to me?"

There are so many millions of people who are jobless or disenfranchised or in situations of profound difficulty right now. And I've got to anger towards that, what is my anger tell me about what I value? So if we can move into a space where instead of pushing aside these signposts that our emotions give us and instead move into a space where we are unpastured with them, where we're curious with them, and where we start saying, how can I even in the midst of fear? I don't need to do away with my fear, the fear just is, it's my body, it's my mind, it's my emotions, doing their job. Our emotions have evolved to help us. And so when we feel fear, that's our emotion trying to help us. So the important thing here is not to do away with it, but also not to get stuck in it. So to develop a sense of what are courageous steps that I can take even in the midst of a reality that I didn't choose and that isn't of my asking, how can I bring myself forward and aware that's courageous and connected? So in brief, emotional agility is the ability to be with ourselves in our fullness with compassion and curiosity so that we can live in ways that our values connected."

And what always just comes to mind, and it's probably very oft-used phrase, but it really, I think, is so profoundly important right now, I think, as I'm speaking, of that beautiful Victor Frankl idea. Victor Frankl who devived the Nazi death camps, who describes what I think is the most profoundly powerful human sentiment, and it's this that between stimulus and response there is a space. And in that space is our power to choose, and it's in that choice that lies our growth and freedom. We didn't choose these circumstances. Often what happens is we get hooked, we get into an experience where there's no space between stimulus and response. We either mindlessly go on to our Twitter feeds and we engage with the news and we could testifies or we feeling so stressed out or we avoid all. And so I think this is really a time of bearing space between stimulus and response.

And so maybe in talking about that specifically, what are some of the ways that might impact us? And then what are some areas that you think you can apply from emotional agility to this new normal? Yeah, so and a very important point here is I think when I talk about having more space to have these experiences, of course, that doesn't mean we are always alone, we might be as I am, I've got two young children who are now home from school and I'm trying to do my work and I'm trying to look after them and there's a lot that's going on."

But actually, what we're thinking about here is physical distancing, physical distancing. We can still, if we are social creatures, which many of us are, we still need to be able to look for meaningful quality interactions that are really critically important to us right now.

You know, we don't need, when we think about loneliness, loneliness is not just, oh, I'm by myself, they're for I'm lonely, you can be in a crowd of people and be lonely. So what is it that we think about when we think about how do you mitigate against, or how do you ameliorate loneliness? Loneliness is actually a function of whether our interactions are meaningful or not. So again, this idea that emotions tell us the story behind our most difficult emotions are signposts to the things that we care about. If you're finding yourself feeling lonely as an example, what is that loneliness, the signpost of? The loneliness is often the signpost that you value, presence and connectedness, and that you don't have enough of it now. So that loneliness is telling you that there's something that you value that you need to be moving more in the direction of. And so you can start asking yourself what are some small changes that I can make that are really important to me right now, in this context of loneliness."

So when people are feeling fearful or when the situation is ambiguous as it is right now, usually what we try to do and this is literally a cognitive reality for us is that our mind tries to fill in the blanks. So we don't know the answers and we try to fill in the blanks. So we might catastrophize or we might you know, develop huge amounts of anxiety or we go to our Twitter feed in search of the answers. And often what that does is it actually provokes the very opposite of what we need. What that provokes is it often provokes more anxiety, more fear and more, you know, we talk about viruses and we talk about physical contagion. But we also know that people can experience very real levels of emotional contagion. Emotional contagion is when you in subtle ways pick up on the emotions of other people because as human beings again, we've evolved to pick up on these cues."

But secondly, can that process itself actually help people that are shifting from feeling the pain to the sort of the agency and the reaching out and try to do something? Can that make a difference? Yes, it's such an important question. It's this thing of double-bona, I see you, but in seeing myself, I'm able to see others too. There's profoundly important way of seeing others. And yes, finding ways that you can contribute. There are so many people in pain right now. There are people who are in their houses who haven't spoken to another soul for days. There are people who need help with essential groceries and services. There are shopkeepers who are struggling. And so within our community, instead of spending our time, you know, trying to get stuck or trying to stop ourselves even from being in this vortex, which I think for so many of us is that experience is really thinking about what a practical way is that we can do it. And what is what's so true for us as human beings is we often think that in order to make a contribution, we've got to do something huge. It's got to be grand. It's got to be massive scale. But you know, if we think about the need to belong, every single one of us needs to belong. And we know that we can half one other person's pain just by being that person's person today that might just be a phone call. But if we can reach beyond ourselves, that's healing for others and it's healing for ourselves as well. And so this is often not about these big things. It's often about what I call tiny tweaks. More values connected actions that we can take that are committed. And even, you know, being at home, being physically distant, there's courage. There's courage in doing that. I mean, we're doing it because we know that it's the right thing, but there's also courage in looking inside of ourselves and owning that you're doing that not only because you have to. But because that is something that is profoundly important that you care about others."

We're really trying to help our children develop their own sense of values and character. And so we can start doing this by showing up to our children's emotions. How are you feeling instead of kind of, you know, say, everything's going to be okay, don't worry about it and try brush over it. Our children are feeling what they're feeling. If we can shut those feelings with compassion, but then also ask our children. And you know, what are ways that you think you can bring yourself to your friends or to your connections or how are ways that you are living right now connected with who you want to be as a person. These are incredible times for us. We didn't ask for them, but we are developing our resilience and our character and the character of those around us without a doubt. So your last comment about children and how you can really have conversations with them about what's going on. You know, a lot of them may be experiencing some of the same emotions that that we're all experiencing, but maybe with a little more confusion because they have less life experience. And so how can we talk to children if there are parents out there about what's going on out there and how they can deal with their emotion? The most important thing we know, you know, you know, spoke about instead of saying, I have said you're noticing that you're feeling said. Another very, very important part of being effective with high emotions is being granular without emotions. And what I mean when I say being granular is often we use very big labels to describe our emotions. You know, people might say I'm stressed, stressed, I'm stressed."

We often as parents with really, really good intentions want to just jump in and say, you know, the child says, Mommy, I'm worried. You know, don't worry, it'll be okay. And again, I take that lesson of my father, you know, it's normal to be scared. What we know for our children is simply showing up to them, simply seeing them and holding space for them to feel what they feel is probably the most important way that children can develop a sense of security in the context of chaos. So that's the showing up part. The second part is again, we are wanting children to feel that their emotions don't own them. When we said to kids, like, I don't worry, everything will be okay or just be happy. What are we teaching? We teaching that some emotions are good and some emotions are bad and that the bad ones should be done away with. And so when we do that very often, children don't get practice with feeling what a difficulty emotion feels like and that don't then develop the strength and the capacity, the psychological resource that that builds. So when a child is feeling what they're feeling, that's what they're feeling. If we can show up to that with compassion, that in of itself is probably the most powerful thing. Then another thing that we can do is we can start helping their child to label their emotions. We know that children as young as two or three years old are able to start differentiating between angry versus said, I feel rejected or I feel it's unfair. So children are starting to develop this language. When our children are going through difficulties, we can help them to do that."

When we experience what in psychological terms is called mortality salience, mortality salience is this idea that our death becomes, it's moved from something that we can conveniently avoid to something that is much more at the periphery. Even if we are directly infected or directly experiencing something, it's much more salient to us. And we know that when human beings have this mortality salience, we tend to become much more ascent them. We tend to become more biased, more stereotyped. There are a lot of predictable psychological responses when we experience this. But we also know that human beings have through time had a well of wisdom and humanity.

You know, even the person who might be hoarding toilet paper, compassion doesn't mean that you agree that that person is doing, you know, the right or the wrong thing.

We can do this. Bye for now. Hey Ted Talks daily listeners. I'm Adam Grant. I host another podcast from Ted. It's called Work Life. And it's about the science of making work not suck. I was the lowest paid employee in my department of 250 people, even though I was the highest rated performer. And it was because I never asked. Learn how to get over your fears and build your negotiation skills. Next time on Work Life with Adam Grant, on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. PRX"
