This week we're bringing you interviews from some of the world's greatest minds to offer tools for us to navigate through and thrive in these really uncertain times. I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers, TED's current affairs curator and I'll be one of your hosts for today's event. Yesterday we kicked off this series with an interview from a claimed psychologist Susan David who offered us some tips on how to really be our best selves in these trying times. And we're going to switch gears a little bit today from thinking about our own personal mental health to the state of our global public health systems."

If this was something like smallpox, that kills 30% of people. So this is horrific. But in fact, most people, even who get the COVID disease, are able to survive. So in that, it's quite infectious, way more infectious than murs or SARS were. It's not as fatal as they were.

Because, like you said, it's the key thing here that it's got this sort of strange combination of being certainly more dangerous than flu. Not as dangerous as something like Ebola or SARS, but more dangerous than flu by a factor. But, but, but infectious.

The good news is that the actual process, the PCR machines, we have a lot in the United States. And so there's models like South Korea who took advantage of February, built up the testing capacity and they were able to contact race and their infections have gone down, even without the type of shutdown that because we're late, we're having to do. One thing that is good news just this week is that people had thought to do this test that you had to have a nurse or doctor shove a swab way up all the way to the back of your throat, which hurts a lot, but also you're going to cough and potentially spread the disease to that healthcare worker. So they have to have protective equipment and change that. What we sent data to the FDA this weekend showing that just a individual by themselves swabbing up to the tip of their nose, they're able to accuracy of that test is essentially the same as having a healthcare worker do it."

You just hand the patient that swab, they do it, put it in the test tube and if the capacity's right within 24 hours, you should get that result back. So how do you see that playing out? Are there other people going to massively scale those tests and how will ordinary citizens be able to get hold of them? Does it still have to be actually kind of prescribed by a doctor at some point or at some point will you be able to just order them off Amazon or something? Well, it's pretty chaotic today because the government hasn't stepped in to make sure that the testing capacity is both increased and it's used for the right cases. There'll be a website and if the federal government doesn't do it a lot of local governments, I'll have to do it, that you go to, you give your situation, including your symptoms, you're told, based on your work and your symptoms, are you a priority? If so, you're told where there are kiosks you can go to and you'll do the self swab and just hand it over or eventually will send the kits to you at home and then you'll send it back and hear that result. Maybe six months from now, you'll actually be able to perform a strip where you perform the tests in the home, but for now, sending it back for the PCR processing, we can have massive capacity there. That's how you know the testing is everything because that's how you know whether you need to do more shutdown or you're starting to get to the point where you can relieve it. Some people are trying to argue now that almost the testing should be dialed back because the cat is out of the bag, testing is bringing people together and risking infection. Forget that, let's just focus on treatment and on isolation strategies. You disagree with that, testing is still absolutely essential and needs to be settled. Well, the two that go together are testing at very high volume and the isolation piece."

And so, you know, testing is the key thing, South Korea did that in this massive way that everybody should learn from. And so that is paired with the isolation piece. Our goal here is to get to the point where a very small percentage of the populations infected, you know, China only 0.01 percent of the population was infected. If you let it, if you don't do these things, you're going to get to the majority of people infected and that huge overload of the medical system."

Like a lot of people are concerned that the price of victory by isolating everyone is that you crash the economy and that, you know, we have to be basically at home not doing our regular jobs for three, six months, maybe, maybe, or year. And so much so that there's now this big debate in the US and other countries about this may just be the wrong strategy that we can't crash the economy that badly. We should only isolate for another couple of weeks and then let people back. And if that means, you know, a lot of other people get sick and we eventually build up herd humidity, that may be the right way to go. What's your thought on this? What is the isolation strategy that eventually leads to us getting back to normal? And it's very tough to say to people, hey, keep going to restaurants, you know, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner."

It's very hard to tell people when there's an epidemic spreading that, you know, threatens particularly their parents or elderly people that they know that they should go about things knowing that their activity is spreading this disease. I don't know of any rich countries that have chose to use that approach. It is true if you did that approach over a period of several years and not people would be infected, you'd have what's called herd immunity. They herd immunity's meaningless until you, in fact, over half the population. And so you can take, you'll overload your medical systems, your case fatality rate instead of being 1%, will be like 3%, 4%."

What we need is the extreme shutdown so that in six to 10 weeks, if things go well, then you can start opening back up. So, so just putting the math together from what you just said, Bill, to get to herd immunity, you need more than half the people in the country to basically get the bug. So, in the case of the US, for example, there'll be 150 million people there about. You said that there could be, that the fatality rate in that scenario, you're talking about 4 to 5 million people in that, potential fatalities. I mean, it's like, like, that's just a horrifying scenario that no one should be contemplating.

Well, if you act when you have, you know, hundreds of cases, you may be able to contain it by doing great testing and great contact tracing and restricting foreigners coming in without as much damage to economy. The US has passed this opportunity to control without shutdown so that the worst case of what was happening in Wuhan in the beginning or in northern Italy in the last few weeks, that we avoid that. But we did not have fast enough to have an ability to avoid the shutdown. But then what I don't understand, in the case of the US, for example, is that if, even if we're successful in bending the curve and reducing the number of new cases from a period of extreme shutdown, as it were, no immunity has been built up.

It seems kind of miraculous to me because this virus was exploding, yes, in Wuhan. But people moved from that. Many other parts of China. How is it possible that the combination of the shutdown in Wuhan and measures elsewhere seem to have got to the point where there are literally no new cases happening? I mean, to me that implies that literally the virus is not circulating at all between humans in China. How on, you know, there's a few tourists coming in who they deal with.

Well, the clear message that we have no choice to maintain this isolation. And that's going to keep going for a period of time, you know, probably in the Chinese case, it was like six weeks. So we have to prepare ourselves for that and do it very well. And then use the testing and every week talk about what's going on with that.

So we look at lab assays, animal models, and so we understand which things should be prioritized for these very quick human trials that need to be done all over the world.

So people who are recovered, it appears, have really effective antibodies in their blood. So you could go, transfuse them and only take out the white cells, the immune cells. And then the question is, okay, how many patients worth of material could you get? You know, if you have that recovered person come in say once a week, do you get enough for two people or five people? Then logistically, you have to take that and get it to where that need is."

Because you could picture this growing worldwide force of heroes, let's call them heroes, who've been through this experience and have a lot to offer the world. Maybe they can offer, you know, blood donation, serum donation. But also other tasks, like if you've got overwhelmed healthcare systems, presumably there are kind of community health worker tasks that people could be trained to do to relieve the pressure that if we knew that they were effectively immune. Yes. And until we came up with the South Swab and showed FDA that that's equivalent, we were thinking the people who might be able to man those kiosks would be the recovered patients.

I'm very worried that there will be a massive number of deaths in those poor countries because the health systems just aren't the number of respirators, hospitals.
