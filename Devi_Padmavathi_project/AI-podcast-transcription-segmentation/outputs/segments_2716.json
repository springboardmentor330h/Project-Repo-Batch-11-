David Brookes, he has earned the wrath of many of the papers left leaning readers because of his conservative views.

I wrote a column about this for a time motto saying that I really believe that a lot of people put on blinders. And maybe for the first time, some people decided that policies that they believed in and being heard and not being invisible anymore, was more important to them than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human.

Second there was the social conservatives who believed in religious liberty, pro-life, prayer in schools. He totally ignored that. There was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue. And then there were physical hawks that people who wanted to cut down on the national debt, tea party, cut the size of government. He's expanding the size of government. There's a man who was single-handedly revolutionized in a major American party, because he understood where the debate was headed before other people. And then guys like Steve Bannon come in and give him substance to his impulses. And so take that a bit further and maybe expand a bit more on your insights into Steve Bannon's worldview.
