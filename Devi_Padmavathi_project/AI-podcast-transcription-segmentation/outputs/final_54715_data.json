See, I have a confession to make. Over the past few months, I've gotten a little obsessed with a problem that can, at my worst moments, feel like something too big to solve, except I don't really believe it is. It's just that this problem, the climate, our climate, the coming climate crisis, needs all of us to do what we can. And so I've been thinking about what Ted can do to help. Usually, Ted plays the role of spreading ideas that matter. That's it. That's our mission. So that other people can take action. But the climate crisis demands a different approach from us, I think. So today, instead of our usual talk, I'm excited to share an announcement. It's actually the most ambitious project Ted has ever announced."

And along the walls, you see projected other people coming in from around the world. I was joined on stage by my co-host, the amazing Christiana Figueres, the key architect of the Paris Climate Agreement. We were joined by members of the media and some of the most important voices on climate. For those projected in remotely, you'll notice the audio quality varying, but it was amazing that they could all participate the way that they did. So look, I hope you enjoy this. And more than that, that you consider this your invitation to get involved, head to countdown. Ted.com to learn more. Okay, here's the announcement. Something remarkable is going to happen in the next hour. The world's single most alarming challenge is about to go head to head with some of the world's most amazing minds and courageous hearts. This initiative that we're just about to launch needs everyone to participate. And here it is. Countdown. Countdown is a global initiative to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It's seeking bold solutions in five big areas, imagining what could be achieved if different groups broke out of their silos and acted together. Starting today, you can go to countdown. Ted.com and sign up to join the countdown. Early in 2020, we'll be sharing plans on how you can connect with others in your company or city or your school to engage in this issue. It's all leading up to global gatherings on 10, 10, 2020. Everyone in the world is invited to participate. And so that's why, although I've been part of many initiatives along the years, I'm really excited about this one, because countdown is an invitation to everyone, everyone to play their part in saving our planet and creating an exciting future."

And if that happens, we believe there is a way out of the climate crisis. That's what we want to facilitate. But now, Chris, question, why are you and Ted interested in participating and actually activating the climate agenda when I thought you were all about spreading ideas? Well, indeed, that has been our focused mission for the last 15 years, ideas were spreading. But last summer, we concluded that the urgency of some issues, and especially climate, demanded that we try to do more than just spread ideas that we actually try to activate them. Now, we're just a relatively small non-profit that would not amount to anything if we fail to bring other people on board."

What was the key to creating that consensus? I would say it was to really challenge and change people's assumption about what is possible if we set a shared intention and then collectively pursue it and achieve it. So our mantra then and continues to be impossible is not a fact. It's an attitude. In fact, only an attitude. And that is something we can change. Well, that mantra is something we're going to have to hold onto in the months ahead. Because the scientific consensus is actually worsening."

Society will have to go through unprecedented changes to meet the scope. Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will bring more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the water shortages in some regions and threats to food security and biodiversity. Higher temperature will bring more of these damages, threatening lives and livelihoods of millions of people all around the world. Well, I could have with us another world-leading scientist, Johann Rockstrom. He was responsible for creating the planetary boundaries framework. Johann, how serious is our situation? Last week, we released a nature, the 10-year update of the risk of crossing tipping points, irreversible tipping points in the earth system. We know 15 such tipping points, including Greenland and West Antarctica Geyshells and the Paramount Frost and the Siberian Tundra, for example. And we today have observational evidence, I mean empirical evidence that nine of the 15 have woken up and are on the move."

So that is why this initiative is so incredibly important. Let's go. Well said. So both are very clear there that this agenda of cutting emissions is absolutely crucial. How has that been going? Not very well, because despite what we know, despite everything the scientists told us, despite everything that we have done, including adopting the Paris Agreement, we've actually been increasing greenhouse gases consistently over the past few decades. To the point where we're now at 55 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent that we are collectively as humanity emitting every year. And as we have heard, we have a one path that is one path that we have to follow and that is start now to decrease emissions instead of going up, go down, reverse the trend, bend the curve, reduce emissions starting in 2020 to the point where we will be at one half the current level of emissions by 2030 and then continue decreasing them until we are at net zero by 2050.

It's fundamentally about how do we increase the amount of sustainable photosynthesis on planet Earth, photosynthesis, sequesters, carbon? There are going to be proposals around giant kelp forests or seagrass or about forms of plants that have deeper roots and can sequester across the planet.

And they have been inspired by Greta Thumberg, but I so many other fantastic young people in almost every country of the world. And today we are delighted to have four young activists come join us today. This Friday I'll have been on climate strike for 52 weeks. That's an entire year. During that time I found that many people don't know about climate change or how serious the climate crisis is. So I founded Earth App Rising International to teach young people about climate change because when they know the science and the impacts they want to take action. Being an activist means making change happen. I became a climate activist because my life depends on it. I'm applying to colleges right now trying to plan for my future but there will be nothing to look forward to if we don't take urgent action to stop the climate crisis now. I started the youth climate justice movement called zero hour back in 2017 because this is zero hour to act on climate change. We have no more time. It became clear to me that our leaders were not going to take real action unless the people stood up and demanded it. So that's exactly what we did. I became a climate justice activist because if I don't fight for the rights of the people today and for the people in the future, who will? I became a climate justice activist when I realized that the climate crisis impacts marginalized communities the most including my town in Mexico. I strike with Fridays for Feature every Friday because our movement is not about gaining momentum but about igniting cultural change. But the fact that thousands of students strike for climate means that we are already implementing climate justice into every aspect of our lives which is already redefining the world."

And so we're inviting all companies, underlying all, to join this initiative to engage with your employees on how you can best protect the planet and your future at the same time. So early next year we'll be sharing a toolkit that can guide companies toward moving quickly towards science-based targets, which gets them then to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. So think about this because as an individual, many individuals feel powerless on this issue. But if you were to team up with others in your company, you might be amazed at how much power you actually have. Almost all emissions come from a company somewhere on the planet. And the thing is many CEOs today are actually eager to help solve the problem. We just heard this morning from Anand Mahindra who had India's biggest business group that he is personally committed on this issue and wants to be part of this journey with us. He's a supporter of countdown. CEOs will be able to move much faster if there's a group of employees there to brainstorm with, to support them to keep that sort of sense of urgency on the topic. So look, our website will help you connect with others in your company and give you guidance on smart questions to ask initiatives to suggest because if companies can be persuaded to do the right thing, suddenly this problem seems to become solvable."

Climate change is about inequality. Inequality between the rich who are mainly responsible for it and the poor who will suffer the most. Inequality between us, homo sapiens who control this planet and the other animals who are our helpless victims. Inequality between the scientists who painstakingly search for the truth and the professional deceivers who spread falsehoods at the click of a button. Climate change is about making a choice. What kind of planet do we want to inhabit and what kind of humans do we want to be? A choice between greed and compassion, between carelessness and responsibility, between closing our eyes to the truth and opening our hearts to the world. Climate change is a crisis, but for humans a crisis is always also an opportunity. If we make the right choices in the coming years, we cannot only save the ecosystem, but we can also create a more just world and make ourselves better people."

Today we have one of those people and a fantastically courageous climate scientist who is a committed Christian and who has been working on this issue with conservatives and with the religious and spiritual communities for years with incredible courage. Catherine Hale. When someone says climate change, we often think, oh, that's just an environmental issue. People who are tree huggers or scientists care about it, or maybe people who are on the left-hand side of the political spectrum. But the reality is whether we know it or not, we already care about climate change no matter who we are. Why? Because climate change affects everything we already care about today. It affects our health. It affects the food we eat, the water we drink, the air that we breathe. Climate change affects the economy and national security. I care about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it, a threat multiplier. It takes issues like poverty and hunger, disease, lack of access to clean water, even political instability, and exacerbates or amplifies them. That's why to care about a changing climate, we don't have to be a certain type of person."

The accumulated amount now traps as much extra energy every day as would be released by 500,000 first-generation atomic bombs exploding every single day. And the consequences are increasingly clear, all that Mother Nature is telling us the fires at the sea level rise and the floods and the mudslides and the loss of living species.

It is unfortunately true at this moment that the crisis is getting worse faster than we are mobilizing these solutions. But renewable energy and electric vehicles and batteries and regenerative agriculture and circular manufacturing and all of these other solutions are gaining momentum. The late economist Rudy Dornbush in articulating what's known as Dornbush's law said things take longer to happen than you think they will.

And sooner, then you think you have that restaurant plus the other one plus the other one, actually information is contagious. And wanting to do the right thing is also contagious. So don't look at it as just simply, you know, what is the straw? Am I using the straw or am I not using plastic bags to do?"

But there is another piece of power that individuals have that they don't think about as much perhaps and that we think that they should, we invite them to, which is what they can do as an employee and what they can do as a member of a city. There's a coming together here, whereby getting organized by connecting with others. We think there is a direct route to changing decisions that will have an even bigger impact on the problem.

If you've ever bought something or you're wearing clothes or you know you're eating food, you know you're a hypocrite. You're creating emissions. It's part of life. And I think perfection is there's a risk that perfection that the pursuit does is sort of an over-pursuit and focus on that and the judging that comes with it can slow everyone down.

I'm from the Wall Street Journal magazine and Chris I really liked what you were saying about the fashion industry and what they can do to change and how it requires employees and CEOs to meet together because who understands an industry better than the people in it and their processes and infrastructure. But I'm wondering what about companies with huge footprints and two that come to mind first are Amazon and Zara where by all accounts the workers, the employees, they don't have very much power and the CEOs don't have very much incentive to change right now. What would you say about those kinds of companies? So this is going to be such an important conversation going forward because we're in the ironic position where the people who can do the most to solve this problem are the people who are currently the worst defenders."

The employee based they're about cover footprint has listened, has engaged with you and with others and they they have announced. I think it's correct to say announce an acceleration of their own commitment to go to basically a net zero track by 2040 if I have it right. It's the companies with the thousands, the tens of thousands of trucks and the packaging and all the rest of it. That is how this problem will get solved.

My name is Jackie with now this news and every day I work with young climate activists like the ones we've heard today but when we do stories on them you know including Greta Thunberg I see fierce criticism that they face and largely it's because of a generational gap. I don't know if you're familiar with the phrase okay boomer but it seems it seems like there's a lot of guilt or accountability that some are looking for and on the other end we're looking at a lack of education or just ignorance on the issue so what is your advice to young people to respond to that criticism to foster constructive conversations. We should probably ask them. Hi thank you for your question come on. It is true that we increase linked face criticism and it's not only when we speak to people with climate desires or things like that but also on social media is as much as a tool to spread information and organize our strikes and get the information out there but it's also a tool for people who want to undermine us to personally attack us and the way in which we stay resilient is to where when we build community with each other when we organize we mimic the world we want to see. There is no hierarchy in our organizing we are all working towards the same goal constructively choosing our passions towards you know making the strike the best it can be we got 300,000 people striking in New York we put together a whole concert people called it climb cell I was great but the point is that it's not going to stop us the criticism is not going to stop us and even though we know that we are kids and we are not here to tell you all the solutions that there already are out there we are going to do it because every kid who cares about the climate crisis is going to grow up to study through an environmental lens and to change the world through that so we are here to tell you personally climate activists that I know don't use okay boomer because we strive for intergenerational cooperation and I think that blaming and dividing dividing each other is not going to get us anywhere which is why we don't use it and I don't think it should be used and I actually want to thank everybody who is doing something because action inspires action and you inspire us and we're glad that we inspire you as well.
