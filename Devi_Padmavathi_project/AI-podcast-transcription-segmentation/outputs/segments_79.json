I mean, there's plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs."

And I think, so I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project, for that matter, to see whether it's contributing or contributing to poverty or trying to elevate it. But to start that, remember that rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for last 60 years. And by and large, this has failed. The question is, why is that? In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe. There's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe."

And in the end, there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies, capitalism, everything else flourished. But if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years. Aid actually did the opposite. It empowered authorities, and as a result, marginalized citizens. The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business."

Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries. Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. It empowers authorities without activating the citizens. Their hands, legs, brains, what have you. And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people."

And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world, the World Bank, is an organization of the government, by the government, for the governments. And that is the perspective I have. And then I can start my story. Of course, how would you empower citizens? There could be all sorts of technologies."

And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. And I walked 10 miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man. And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back. So I had another unproductive day."

And basically concluded that connectivity is productivity, whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village. So naturally, the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty. And if that's the case, then question is how many telephones do we have at that time? And it turns out that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people. And all those phones were in its few urban places. The vast rural areas where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones."

And you see a vast amount of resource wasted. And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we got equal is that days are same length, 24 hours. So if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries, that's a huge waste. The question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?"

And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down, because there's a digital revolution going on, then it would be even more dramatic. And I knew little economics by then."

Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer, and Chris is a fisherman farmer, both are generalists. Generally I would start fishing, he would start farming only when we can depend on each other. The point is that we could only depend on each other if we can connect with each other. And if we're neighbors, I could just walk over to his house, but then we're limiting our economic sphere to something very small area. But in order to expand that, you need a river, or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines. But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability, and that leads to specialization, that leads to productivity."

There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones. And one of them is the lacking buying power. Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that? I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down."

So you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing. For instance, the internet was booming in the US because there were people had computers, they had modems, they had telephone lines. So it's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet. But that's what's lacking in a poor country. So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks, a few banks to collect bills, et cetera. But that's why I noticed Gram in Bank, which was a bank for poor people and had 1,100 branches, 2,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers."

They had to be. And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and suddenly be and rock the boat."

The cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan. And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else. And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow because somebody, she could borrow $200 from the bank, get a phone, and have the phone for everybody and it's a business for her. And I wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said, little crazy, but logical."

I created a company in America called GonoFone, which is in Bengali means people's phone. And angel investors in America put in money into that. I flew around the world. After about a million, I mean, I got rejected from lots of places because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country. So after about a million miles and a meaningful, I guess substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium and which involved the Norwegian telephone company which provided the know-how and the Grammy in Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service."

And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people. And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like $700 per year. The result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with 3.5 million subscribers, 115,000. These phones I talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network. And 2004, the net profit after taxes, very serious taxes, was $120 million. And the company contributed about $190 million to the government coffers. Here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services. Actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that. Governments need to subsidize private companies."
