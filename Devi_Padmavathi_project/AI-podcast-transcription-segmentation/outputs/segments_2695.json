I think the basic thing that happens is that we have lost our story. Humans think in stories and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories. And for the last few decades, we had a very simple and very attractive story about what's happening in the world. And the story said that, oh, what's happening is that the economy is being globalized, politics is being liberalized, and the combination of the two will create paradise on earth. We just need to keep on globalizing the economy and liberalizing the political system, and everything will be wonderful. And 2016 is the moment when a very large segment even of the Western world stopped believing in this story."

At least from all the people in the world, you are most likely to be killed by yourself. Which is, again, very good news compared to the level of violence that we saw in previous eras.

It feels like the old way that people thought of politics. The left right divide has been blown up and replaced. How should we think of this? The old 20th century political model of left versus right is now largely relevant. And the real divide today is between global and national, global or local. And you see it, again, all over the world, that this is now the main struggle. We probably need completely new political models and completely new ways of thinking about politics. In essence, what you can say is that we now have global ecology. We have a global economy, but we have national politics."

And you have basically two solutions to this imbalance. Either de-globalize the economy and turn it back into a national economy or globalize the political system. So some, I guess many liberals out there, view Trump and his government as kind of irredeemably bad, just awful and every way. Do you see any underlying narrative of political philosophy in there that is at least worth understanding? How would you articulate that philosophy? Is it just the philosophy of nationalism? I think the underlying feeling or idea is that the political system, something is broken there. It doesn't empower the ordinary person anymore. It doesn't care so much about the ordinary person anymore. And I think this diagnosis of the political disease is correct."

And the ability to have a large number of people care about each other, sympathize with one another, and come together for collective action. If you go back to the first nations, so thousands of years ago, the people who live along the Yellow River in China, it was many, many different tribes. And they all dependant on the river for survival and for prosperity. But they all of them also suffered from periodical floods and periodical droughts. And no tribe could do anything about it because each of them controlled just a tiny section of the river. And then in a long and complicated process, the tribes coalesced together to form the Chinese nation, which controlled the entire Yellow River and had the ability to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to build dams and canals and regulate the river and prevent the worst floods and droughts and raise the level of prosperity for everybody."

We are now living all people in the world, are living alongside the same cyber river. And no single nation can regulate this river by itself. We are all living together in a single planet, which is threatened by our own actions. And if you don't have some kind of global corporation, nationalism just is not on the right level to tackle the problems of whether it's climate change or whether it's technological disruption. So it was a beautiful idea in a world where most of the action, most of the issues took place on national scale. But your argument is that the issues that matter most today no longer take place on a national scale, but on a global scale."

It's not just climate change, which is like the most obvious example people give. I think more in terms of technological disruption, if you think about for example artificial intelligence over the next 20, 30 years pushing hundreds of millions of people out of the job market. This is a problem on a global level. It will disrupt the economy of all the countries. And similarly, if you think about say bioengineering and people being afraid of conducting, I don't know, genetic engineering research on humans. It won't help if just a single country outlaw, let's say the US outlaws all genetic experiments on humans. But China or North Korea continues to do it. So the US cannot solve it by itself. And very quickly, the pressure on the US to do the same will be immense because we are talking about high-risk, high-gain technologies."

The only way to have regulations, effective regulations on things like genetic engineering is to have global regulations. If you just have national regulations, nobody would like to stay behind. So this is really interesting. So it seems to me this may be one key to provoking at least a constructive conversation between the different sides here because I think everyone can agree that the start point of a lot of the anger that's propelled us to where we are is because of the legitimate concerns about job loss. Workers gone, a traditional way of life has gone. And it's no wonder that people are furious about that. And in general, they have blamed globalism, global elites for doing this to them without asking their permission. And that seems like a legitimate complaint. But what I hear you saying is that, so a key question is, what is the real cause of job loss, both now and going forward? To the extent that it's about globalism, then the right response, yes, is to shut down borders and keep people out and change trade agreements and so forth. But you're saying, I think that actually the bigger cause of job loss is not going to be that at all."

So unless you plan to build a big wall on the border of California, the wall on the border is Mexico is going to be very ineffective. And I was struck when I watched the debates before the elections. I was struck that certainly Trump did not even attempt to frighten people by saying the robots will take your jobs."

And it's made me afraid because it meant that no matter what happens in universities and laboratories and there there is already an intense debate about it, but in the mainstream political system and among the general public, people are just unaware that there could be an immense technological disruption not in 200 years, but in 10, 20, 30 years. And we have to do something about it now, partly because most of what we teach children today in school or in college is going to be completely irrelevant to the job market of 2040, 2050. So it's not something we'll need to think about in 2040. We need to think today what to teach the young people."

I mean, if you've often written about moments in history, where humankind has entered a new era unintentionally, like decisions of a May, technologists have developed, and suddenly the world has changed, and it may possibly, in a way that's worse for everyone. So one of the examples you give in sapiens is just the whole, even the whole agricultural revolution, which for an actual person tilling the fields, they just picked up a 12-hour backbreaking workday instead of 10, you know, six hours in the jungle and a much more interesting lifestyle.

But when you look at actual individual lives, the life of a tiny elite became much better, and the life of the majority of people became considerably worse. And this can happen again in the 21st century. No doubt the new technologies will empower the human collective. But we may end up, again, with a tiny elite ripping all the benefits, taking all the fruits, and the masses of the population finding themselves, you know, worse than they were before. Certainly much worse than this tiny elite. And those elites might not even be human elites."

But then when you think about it, it's obvious because nationalism has no solution to climate change. If you want to be a nationalist in the 21st century, you have to deny the problem.

The good news we have in the much with regard to the dangers of nationalism, we are in a much better position than a century ago. A century ago, 1917, Europeans were killing each other by the millions. In 2016 with Brexit, as far as I remember, a single person lost her life, an MP who was murdered by some extremist, just a single person. I mean, if Brexit was about British independence, this is the most peaceful war of independence in human history. And if let's say that Scotland will now choose to leave the UK after Brexit. So in the 18th century, if Scotland wanted, and the Scots wanted several times to break out of the control of London, the reaction of the government in London was to send an army up north to burn down Edinburgh and massacre the Highland Tribes. And my guess that if in 2018 the Scots vote for independence, the London government will not send an army up north to burn down Edinburgh. Very few people are now willing to kill or be killed for Scottish or for British independence. So for all the talk of the rise of nationalism and going back in 1930s or to the 19th century, in the West at least, the power of national sentiments today is far, far smaller than it was a century ago. Although some people now you hear publicly worrying about whether that might be shifting and that there could actually be outbreaks of violence in the US depending on how things turn out."

We look at people within the United States who have been recruited by ISIS. We look at these other groups which have formed, which go outside of national bounds, but still represent significant authorities. How are they to be integrated into this system and how is the diverse set of identities to be made coherent under either national or global leadership? Well, the problem of such diverse identities is a problem from nationalism as well. Nationalism believes in a single monolithic identity and in an exclusive or at least the more extreme versions of nationalism, believing in an exclusive loyalty to a single identity.

It won't be easy for an unemployed truck driver to reinvent himself or herself as a designer of virtual worlds. And previously, if you look at the trajectories of the industrial revolution, when machines replaced humans in one type of work, the solution usually came from low-scale work in new lines of business. So you didn't need any more agricultural workers. So people moved to working in low-scale industrial jobs. And when this was taken away by more and more machines, people moved to low-scale service jobs. Now, when people say there will be new jobs in the future, that humans can do better than AI, that humans can do better than robots, they usually think about high-skilled jobs like software engineers designing virtual worlds. Now, I don't see how an unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart reinvents herself or himself at 50 as a designer of virtual worlds.

I mean, is it in your own thinking, is there a chance that what humans are for are to be the universe's sentient things, you know, to be the centers of joy and love and happiness and hope. And maybe we can build machines that actually help amplify that, even if they're not going to become sentient themselves. Is that crazy? I thought I kind of got from myself hoping that reading your book. Well, I certainly think that the most interesting question today in science is the question of consciousness and the mind. We are getting better and better in understanding the brain and intelligence. But we are not getting much better in understanding the mind and consciousness. People often confuse intelligence and consciousness, especially in places like Silicon Valley, which is understandable because in humans, they go together. I mean, intelligence basically is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, to feel joy and sadness and boredom and pain and so forth. In homo sapiens and all other mammals as well, it's not unique to humans. In all mammals and birds and some other animals, intelligence and consciousness go together. We often solve problems by feeling things. So we tend to confuse them. But there are different things. What's happening today in places like Silicon Valley is that we are creating artificial intelligence, but not artificial consciousness. There has been an amazing development in computer intelligence over the last 50 years, and exactly zero development in computer consciousness. And there is no indication that computers are going to become conscious any time soon. So first of all, if there is some cosmic role for consciousness, it's not unique to homo sapiens. Caves are conscious, pigs are conscious, chimpanzees are conscious, chickens are conscious. So if we go that way, first of all, we need to broaden our horizons and remember very clearly, we are not the only sentient beings on Earth. And when it comes to sentience, I mean, when it comes to intelligence, there is good reason to think we are the most intelligence of the whole bunch. But when it comes to sentience, to say that humans are most sentient and whales or most sentient than baboons or more sentient and cats, I see no evidence for that."

So how do we present and justify that idea of global versus holistically, like, wholly nationalist to people in countries like Ghana and Nigeria and Togo, you know, other countries like that? Thank you. I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair and that we should we should realize that many of the countries that suffered most from the last 200 years of globalization and imperialism and industrialization are exactly the countries which will also most likely to suffer most from the next wave. And we should be very, very clear about that if we don't have a global governance and if we suffer from climate change, from technological disruptions, the worst suffering will not be in the US. The worst suffering will be in Ghana, will be in Sudan, will be in Syria, will be in Bangladesh, will be in those places. So I think those countries have an even greater incentive to do something about the next wave of disruption, whether it's ecological or whether it's technological. Again, if you think about technological disruption, so if AI and 3D printers and robots will take the jobs from billions of people, I worry far less about the Swedes than about the people in Ghana or in Bangladesh. And therefore because history is so unfair and the results of a calamity will not be shared equally between everybody.

Many countries basically took out war from their political toolkit. They no longer tried to pursue their interests with warfare. Not all countries have done so, but many countries have. And this is maybe the most important reason while international violence have declined dramatically since 1945. And today, as I said, more people commit suicide than are killed in war."

    "text": "So this, I think, gives us a good example that even the most frightening technology humans can rise up to the challenge. And actually, some good can come out of it. The problem is, we have very little margins for error. If we don't get it right, we might not have a second option to try again. That's a very powerful note on which I think we should draw this to inclusion. Before I wrap up, I just want to say one thing to people here and to the global TED community watching online, anyone watching online."

Try and have conversations with people you disagree with, understand them, pull the pieces together, and help us figure out how to take these conversations forward so that we can make a real contribution to what's happening in the world right now. I think everyone feels more alive, more concerned, more engaged with the politics of the moment."
