TETOXA made possible through the support of BMW. Here's Evelyn Glenny. Of course, my job is all about listening and my aim really is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big job because when you look at a piece of music, for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag, we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And we open it up and I read the music. So technically, I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore, because time is short, if I just play you literally the first, maybe, two lines or so. It's very straightforward. There's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum."

However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music. Everything that isn't time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher. But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument, that in fact becomes so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum. So there, we experience the translation. Now, we'll experience the interpretation."

If I play, for example, holding the stick, where literally I do not let go of the stick, you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stuck stick, even although I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm to be more of a support system, suddenly, I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. And I just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum and I'm doing far, far less. So, in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them, not just translate them, but interpret them. If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician, not as someone who is basically a percussion player. And so on, if I think of myself as a musician. And so on, there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just thinking about. And I remember when I was 12 years old and I started playing Timpani in percussion."

And I said, well, I think I do too. But I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, my cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on. And so we began our lessons every single time. Tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums are Timpani, to such a narrow pitch interval. So something like that of a difference, then gradually and gradually. And it's amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room. And together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things, the room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks, etc., etc., they're all different."

And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore I said to them, well, look, if you refuse, if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound, then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do. And we actually accept. And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle and having to audition twice, they accepted me and not only that, what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom."

And so therefore this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions. And I have to say many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well though is that it's quite simply that not only where people connected with sound, which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine. I say music, but actually I mean sound. Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. Suddenly if that young lad sits close to this instrument, at perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like almost."

It may be that in other halls, there's simply not going to experience that at all. And so therefore, my level of soft, soft, gentle playing may have to be... So because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the deaf community, this is not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy, although of course being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well.
