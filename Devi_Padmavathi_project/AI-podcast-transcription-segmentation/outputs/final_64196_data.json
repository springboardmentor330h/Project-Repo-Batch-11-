    "transcript": "So welcome, Ibrahim, and thank you so much for joining us. Well, thank you, Chloe, and Whitney, and thank you everyone for joining this conversation. So a few weeks ago, on the same day we learned about the brutal murder of George Floyd, we also learned that a white woman in Central Park who chose not to leash her dog and was told by a black man nearby that she needed to leash her dog, instead decided to threaten this black male, instead decided to call the police and claim that her life was being threatened. And of course, when we learned about that through a video, many Americans were outraged. And this woman, Amy Cooper, ended up going on national TV and saying, like, countless other Americans have said, right after they engaged in a racist act, I am not racist. And I say countless Americans because when you really think about the history of Americans, expressing racist ideas, supporting racist policies, you're really talking about a history of people who have claimed they're not racist because everyone claims that they're not racist, whether we're talking about the Amy Cooper's of the world, whether we're talking about Donald Trump who right after he said that majority black Baltimore is a rat and wrote an infested mess that no human being would want to live in. And he was challenged as being racist. He said, actually, I'm the least racist person anywhere in the world. And so really the heartbeat of racism itself has always been denial. And the sound of that heartbeat has always been, I'm not racist. And so what I'm trying to do with my work is to really get Americans to eliminate the concept of not racist from the epocabularity and realize we're either being racist or anti-racist. We're either expressing ideas that suggest certain racial groups are better or worse than others, superior or inferior than others, we're either being racist or we're being anti-racist. We're expressing the racial, expressing notions that the racial groups are equals despite any cultural or even ethnic differences. We're either supporting policies that are leading to racial inequities and injustice like we saw in Louisville where Breonna Taylor was murdered or we're supporting policies and pushing policies that are leading to justice and inequity for all. And so I think we should be very clear about whether we're expressing racist ideas, about whether we're expressing supporting racist policies and admit when we are, because to be anti-racist is to admit when we expressed a racist idea, is to say, you know what, when I was doing that in Central Park, I was indeed being racist. And I'm going to change, I'm going to strive to be anti-racist. And to be racist is to constantly deny the racial inequities that pervade American society, to constantly deny the racist ideas that pervade American minds."

Thank you. Thank you so much for that. You know, your book, How to Be an Anti-Racist, is to become a bestseller in light of what's been happening. And you've been speaking a bit to, you know, the ways in which anti-racism and racism are the only two polar opposite ways to hold of you on racism. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about what the basic tenets of anti-racism are for people who aren't as familiar with it in terms of how they can be anti-racists. Sure. And so I mentioned in my talk that the heartbeat of racism is denial. And really the heartbeat of anti-racism is confession. Is the recognition that to grow up in this society is to literally, at some point in our lives, probably internalize ideas that are racist. Ideas that suggest certain racial groups are better or worse than others. And because we believe in racial hierarchy, because Americans have systematically taught that black people are more dangerous when that black people are more criminal like, when we live in a society where black people are 40% of the national incarcerated population, that's going to seem normal to people. When we live in a society in a city like Minneapolis where black people are 20% of the population, but more than 60% of the people being subjected to police shootings, it's going to seem normal. And so to be anti-racist is to believe that there's nothing wrong or inferior about black people or any other racial group. There's nothing dangerous about black people or any other racial group. And so when we see these racial disparities all around us, we see them as abnormal. And then we start to figure out, okay, what policies are behind so many black people being killed by police?"

How, what is the difference between the two? In the most simplest way, a not racist is a racist who is in denial. And an anti-racist is someone who is willing to admit the times in which they're being racist and who is willing to recognize the inequities and the problems of racial problems of our society and who is willing to challenge those racial inequities by challenging policy. And so I'm saying this because literally slaveholders, slave traders imagine that their ideas in our terms were not racist. They would say things like black people are the cursed descendants of him and their cursed forever into enslavement. This isn't, I'm not racist, this is God's law. They would say things like, you know, based on science, based on ethnology, based on natural history, black people by nature are predisposed to slavery and civility."

And then some have the, some people of color say they can't be racist because they have no power. And so first and foremost, what I've tried to do in my work is to push back against this idea that people of color have no power. There's nothing more disempowering to say or to think as a person of color, then to say you have no power. People of color have long utilized the most basic power that every human being has. And that's the power to resist policy and power. That's the power to resist racist policies. That's the power to resist the racist society. But if you're a person of color and you believe that people coming here from Honduras and Alasabradore are invading this country, you believe that these Latinx immigrants are animals and rapists. And you're certainly not if you're black or Asian or native going to be a part of the struggle to defend Latinx immigrants, to recognize that Latinx immigrants have much to give to this country as any other group of people. You're going to view these people as taking away your jobs. And so therefore, you're going to support racist rhetoric. You're going to support racist policies. And even though that is probably going to be harming you, in other words, it's going to be harming if your black immigrants coming from Haiti and Nigeria. If you're Asian, immigrants coming from India. And so I think it's critically important for even people of color to realize they have the power to resist. And if when people of color view other people of color as the problem, they're not going to view racism as the problem. And anyone who is not viewing racism as the problem is not being anti-racist."

But you've talked about how racism is the reason that black communities and communities of color are systemically disadvantaged in America, which has led to so many more deaths from COVID-19 in those communities. And yet the media is often placing the blame on people of color for their vulnerability to illness. So I'm curious in line with that, what is the relationship between anti-racism and the potential for systemic change? I think it's a direct relationship. Because when you believe and have consumed racist ideas, you're not going to even believe changes necessary because you're going to believe that racial inequality is normal. Or you're not going to believe changes possible. In other words, you're going to believe that the reason why black people are being killed by police at such high rates or the reason why Latinx people are being infected at such high rates is because there's something wrong with them and nothing can be changed. And so you wouldn't even begin to even see the need for systemic structural change, let alone be a part of the struggle for systemic structural change. And so to be anti-racist, again, is to recognize that there's only two causes of racial inequity. Either there's something wrong with people or there's something wrong with power and policy. And if you realize that there's nothing wrong with any group of people, and I keep mentioning groups, you know, I'm not saying individuals. There are certainly black individuals who didn't take coronavirus seriously, which is one of the reasons why they were infected. But there are white people who didn't take coronavirus seriously. There's no one has ever proven actually studies have shown that black people were more likely to take the coronavirus seriously than white people. We're not talking about individuals here. And we certainly should not be individualizing groups. We certainly should not be looking at the individual behavior of one Latinx person, a one black person, and saying they're representatives of the group. That's a racist idea in and of itself. And so I'm talking about groups. And if you believe the groups are equals, then the only other alternative, the only other explanation to persisting inequity and injustice is power and policy. And to then spend your time transforming and challenging power and policy is to spend your time being anti-racist."

And obviously, Republicans in a claim, they're not saying that, but it's a very simple thing. Either you believe Black Lives Matter or you don't. And if you believe Black Lives Matter, because you believe in human rights and you believe in the human right for Black people and all people to live and to not have to fear police of violence and not have to fear the state and not have to fear that a peaceful process is going to be broken up because some politician wants to get a campaign up. Then you're going to institute policy that that shows it or you're not."

You know, I imagine that a lot of folks, they hear this and they're like, oh, you know, I have to, I have to be really thoughtful about how my actions and my words are perceived. What is the perceived intention behind what it is that I'm saying? And that that may feel exhausting. And I think that connects even to this idea of policy. And so I'm curious, you know, there isn't a huge element of thoughtfulness that comes along with this work of being anti-racist. And, you know, what is your reaction and response to those who feel concerned about the mental exhaustion from having to constantly think about how your actions may hurt or harm others? So I think part of the concern that people have about mental exhaustion is this idea that they don't ever want to make a mistake. And I think to be anti-racist is to make mistakes and is to recognize when we make a mistake. For us, it's what's critical is to have those very clear definitions so that we can assess our words, we can assess our deeds. And when we make a mistake, we just own up to it and say, you know what, that was a racist idea. You know what, that was supporting a racist policy."

And I'm actually, yes, it's difficult to restrain myself from reverting back to what I'm addicted to, but at the same time, it's liberating. It's freeing because I'm no longer having to wallow in that addiction. And so I think, and I'm no longer having to hurt people due to my addiction. And I think that's critical. You know, I think we spend too much time thinking about how we feel. And last time, thinking about how our actions and ideas make others feel. And I think that's one thing that the George Floyd video forced Americans to do was to really see and hear, especially, how someone feels as a result of their racism. We have another question from the audience. This one is asking about, can you speak to the intersectionality between the work of anti-racism, feminism and gay rights? How does the work of anti-racism relate and affect the work for these other human rights issues? Sure. So, when I define a racist idea, as any idea that suggests a racial group is superior to an inferior to another racial group in any way. And I use the term racial group as opposed to race because every race is a collection of racialized intersectional groups. And so you have black women and black men and you have black heterosexuals and black queer people. Just as you have Latinx women and white women and Asian men. And what's critical for us to understand is there hasn't just been racist ideas that have targeted, let's say, black people. There's been racist ideas that have been developed and have targeted black women, that have targeted black lesbians, that have targeted black transgender women. And oftentimes these racist ideas targeting these intersectional groups are intersecting with other forms of bigotry that is also targeting these groups. To give an example about black women, one of the oldest racist ideas about black women was this idea that they're inferior women or that they're not even women at all. And that they're inferior to white women who are the pinnacle of womanhood. And that idea has intersected with this sexist idea that suggests that women are weak. That the more weak a person is or woman is, the more woman she is. And the stronger a woman is, the more masculine she is. These two ideas have intersected to constantly sort of degrade black women as this idea of the strong black masculine woman who is inferior to the weak white woman. And so the only way to really understand these constructs above a weak super feminine white woman and a strong hyper masculine black woman is to understand sexist ideas. Is to reject sexist ideas. And I'll say very quickly the same goes for the intersection of racism and homophobia, in which black queer people have been subjected to this idea that they are more hypersexual because there's this idea of queer people as being more hypersexual than heterosexuals. And so black queer people have been tagged as more hypersexual than white queer people and black heterosexuals. And if you can't really see that and understand that and reject that, if you're not rejecting and understanding and challenging homophobia too. And you know to this point of challenging, we have another question from Miriam Mohit in our community who asks, how do you see cancel culture and anti-racism interacting? For example, when someone did something obviously racist in the past and it comes to light, how do we respond to that?"

But I also think that there are people who do something so egregious and there are people who are so unwilling to recognize how egregious what they just did is. So in a particular moment, so not just the horrible, vicious act. But then on top of that, the refusal to even admit the horrible, vicious act, in that case, I can see how people would literally want to cancel them. And I think that we have to, on the other hand, we have to have some sort of consequence, public consequence, cultural consequence for people acting in a racist manner, especially in an extremely egregious way. And for many people, they've decided, you know what, I'm just going to cancel folks. And I'm not going to necessarily critique them, but I do think we should try to figure out a way to discern those who are refusing to transform themselves and those who made a mistake and recognized it and truly are committed to transforming themselves. Yeah, I mean, you know, one of the concerns many activists have been expressing is that the energy behind the Black Lives Matter movement has to stay high for anti-racist change to truly take place. I think that applies to what you just said as well. And I guess I'm curious what your opinion is on, you know, when the protests start to wane and people's donation matching campaigns faded to the background. How can we all ensure that this conversation about anti-racism stays central?"

There are countries who try to fight violent crime, not with more police in prisons, but with more jobs and more opportunities because they know and see that the communities with the highest levels of violent crime tend to be communities with high levels of poverty and long term unemployment. I think that, and then obviously other countries provides pretty sizable social safety nets for people such that people are not committing crimes out of poverty.

I mean, people see there's a fundamental problem here and there's a problem that can be solved. There's an America that can be created and people are calling for this and that is always the beginning. The beginning is what we're experiencing now. I think that this next audience question follows well from that, which is what gives you hope right now. So certainly resistance to racism has always given me hope.

And so resistance always brings me hope because it is always resistance that, and it's of course, it's stormy, but the rainbow is typically on the other side.
