 there's like a little app where I upload my photos and then it does something fun with them. I might enjoy it once or twice, but if I feel like I'm not really doing anything, I don't have any control over what comes out, even if it's kind of cool, I'm very unlikely to come back. But we had a whole bunch of one-hit wonder, sort of Gen.AI products. People want to feel that they're doing something. People want to express themselves. They want to realize their own ideas.
