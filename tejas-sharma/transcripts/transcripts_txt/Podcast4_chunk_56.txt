 pretty good but not very common. The problem is that science fiction has convinced investors and some entrepreneurs that it's better to create an all-knowing oracle that gives you the most expected, most safe, most you've seen it a million times already answer, which is maybe good for a fact lookup table, but it really limits what Gen.A.I. can do and it's never actually going to be very good at being an all-knowing oracle regardless of what we do.
