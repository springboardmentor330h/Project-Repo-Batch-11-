 I don't have a good answer to this, but you're a lot more creative than I am. How do we, how do we convince big enterprises, product managers to move away from just stickiness to empowering people? I think we need to explain to them why something like, why the products that are successful, why they are successful. Chatchapiti has not been beat yet. It's a number one. It's one of the most successful products in history.
