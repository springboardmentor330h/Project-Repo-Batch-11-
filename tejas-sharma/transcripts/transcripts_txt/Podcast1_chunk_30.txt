 So it's a good break between my professional life and my personal life because then when I go out of the gym, my friends are also out of work and so I can go hang out with them or even go play pickleball. So I know that I'm going to be working out four times per week, usually Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, but it's not super rigid. I just want to get those four times per week in. Excellent.
