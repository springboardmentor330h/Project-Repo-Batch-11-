Segment 1 Summary:
space models and things like that 

Segment 2 Summary:
There's a series of papers from 2021 all the way up to 2025, still working on it 

Segment 3 Summary:
That introduced some really great optimizations inside of state space models to make them appropriate for sequence transformation and language modeling tasks 

Segment 4 Summary:
So you get this evolution of structured state space models to your S4 paper
