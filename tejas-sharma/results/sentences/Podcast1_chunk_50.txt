So there is a bit of a difference here, but yes, you did, you know, you did a high school and your first degrees in France, including a diploma in engineering, a master of science in engineering at Centra de Superlake with a 4.0 GPA.
Congratulations.
And as you said, you know, lots of mathematics courses, statistics, programming, optimization, economics.
