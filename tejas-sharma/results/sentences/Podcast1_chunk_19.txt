very clearly do a 180 in both my career and my personal life at the same time.
Fantastic.
Were you into fitness before getting this fitness and lifestyle coach or was that something new?
So I was, but I was not doing the right things, meaning that I was also burnt out in my fitness.
Because outside of my job, I wanted to have something that I was looking forward to, so I was working out.
