 there is no way you're going to be able to fall asleep. And it's also about the quality of the sleep that you have. It's not only about eight hours, but eight hours of quality sleep with deep sleep, REM sleep, to just for your brain. And the best way to have it is also to be able to downregulate and not be stressed during the day. And for me, it comes in the form of just going on walks outside even just five minutes.
