 Now, you can give me, since I've visualized, you can give me access as visualized to go and open that safe. And that's role-based. But then you can say, you know what, there are other people's money in that safe. So I'm going to give visualized just enough to withdraw cash for the next 10 seconds and then move out. So that's like a task-based access control. But then I need to parse the communication that's happening between myself and the others.
