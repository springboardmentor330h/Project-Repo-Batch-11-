[0.27 - 3.00] IRA GLASS: From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life.
[3.00 - 4.58] IRA GLASS: OK, give me a level.
[4.58 - 9.06] NEIL DRUMMING: This is me about how much, how loud I talk.
[9.06 - 13.73] IRA GLASS: Not long ago, one of my coworkers here at the radio show, Neil Drumming, and I took a field trip to Philadelphia.
[13.73 - 18.10] NEIL DRUMMING: We're going to Amalgam Comics and Coffee.
[18.10 - 19.31] IRA GLASS: It's a comic shop.
[19.31 - 22.02] NEIL DRUMMING: It's a comic book store. Yeah, and also, like, a coffee shop.
[22.02 - 23.42] IRA GLASS: No, no. I got that from the name.
[23.42 - 32.51] NEIL DRUMMING: [CHUCKLING] Yes. But it's, I think, the first comic book store owned by a black woman on the East Coast.
[32.51 - 34.01] IRA GLASS: On the East Coast? We have to add that?
[34.01 - 35.53] NEIL DRUMMING: I think we do.
[35.53 - 48.35] IRA GLASS: We're here because recently Neil has gotten really interested in Afrofuturism. And there's this whole intersection between Afrofuturism and comic books. The founder of something called the Afrofuturism Network is speaking at this comic store on this particular day.
[48.35 - 52.04] IRA GLASS: And what exactly is Afrofuturism? Neil's been prepping for this question.
[52.04 - 85.27] NEIL DRUMMING: I don't know. There's-- there's, like, a long-winded academic Wikipedia explanation, which I've never even been able to internalize or remember, honestly, if we're being honest. What I like about Afrofuturism, it just seems very-- it's like this way of talking about black people in a way that's really hopeful. It's this idea that we would be engaged in the same kinds of things that, you know, science fiction writers have always talked about-- that we would be engaged with technology, that we would have a future in space, that we would master time travel, that we would have a future in Utopian or Dystopian landscapes. It's like--
[85.27 - 113.95] IRA GLASS: So partly this is about science fiction. That's really just the tip of the iceberg. And the science fiction part is meaningful because, while there have been black characters in sci-fi for a while now, they're almost never the protagonists. They're never the ones driving the action. And for so long, in so many imaginings of the future, in so much science fiction, there were no black people at all-- which, as Neil points out, makes no sense. He says, you can tell black people are going to make it into the future because they've survived so much already over the centuries.
[113.95 - 132.74] NEIL DRUMMING: One of the things that's sort of really specific about Afrofuturism that I like is that it takes into account the past in a lot of ways. It imagines that, you know, black people have forms of survival through, you know, the slave trade, through persecution, that that's almost a technology in itself, the ways in which we've come through those things.
[132.74 - 134.22] IRA GLASS: Oh, I see. The survival skills.
[134.22 - 169.72] NEIL DRUMMING: Yeah. And that everything that's been a part of our culture has made it possible for us to pave the way for the future. That's the thing that I like about it, I think-- the feeling like, despite whatever trials or travails you've come through, that you will exist in the future. That just kind of makes me-- it makes me kind of, like, love being black. It makes me feel what I love about being black-- like, oh yeah, you know, we can get through this.
[169.72 - 179.92] IRA GLASS: Things I've known about forever, Neil says, are now called Afrofuturism. Old-school stuff, like Parliament-Funkadelic's pimped-out trippy rides to outer space, which predates the term by 20 years.
[179.92 - 191.18] GEORGE CLINTON: (RAPPING) All right, Starchild. Citizens of the universe, recording angels, we have returned to claim the pyramids. Partying on the mothership. I am the mothership connection.
[191.18 - 212.56] IRA GLASS: And lately you see lots of famous black people excited about Afrofuturism. Rihanna and Solange appear in black space-age fashion. The director of Selma and 13th, Ava Duvernay, is making a TV series based on a novel by the woman who is kind of a godmother to the movement-- sci-fi writer Octavia Butler. That's after Duvernay finishes the science fiction classic A Wrinkle in Time, with black actors in lots of the leads.
[212.56 - 223.81] IRA GLASS: Donald Glover's last Childish Gambino album was a tribute to Parliament-Funkadelic. And Janelle Monae's tour a couple of years ago was a whole sci-fi stage show with men in lab coats and a story about androids. She sings about spaceships.
[223.81 - 236.10] JANELLE MONAE: (SINGING) Baby, ooh. l'll reprogram your mind. Come on, get in. My spaceship leaves at 10. Oh!
[236.10 - 250.89] IRA GLASS: And comics-- Neil and I were in Philadelphia for comics, after all. The thing that Neil was most excited to see in the comic book store was the new Iron Man, where-- I don't know if you've heard this-- in the comics, Tony Stark is in a coma, replaced by a black teenage girl, Genius.
[250.89 - 257.61] NEIL DRUMMING: And she invents a suit that's comparable to Tony Stark's Iron Man suit, which is, like, my favorite piece of fictional technology anyway.
[257.61 - 265.98] IRA GLASS: As he points out, replacing Tony Stark with a black teenage girl, that pierces right into the Arc Reactor heart of the techno superhero sci-fi pantheon.
[265.98 - 268.82] NEIL DRUMMING: I mean, think about who Tony Stark, the original Iron Man, is.
[268.82 - 269.55] IRA GLASS: Right.
[269.55 - 282.50] NEIL DRUMMING: He's a wealthy white man. He's, like, a millionaire white guy. He's the unattainable. Like, it's great to have a robot suit and save the world, but how do most people imagine themselves in that context?
[282.50 - 282.99] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[282.99 - 292.27] NEIL DRUMMING: Whereas this girl, her education takes her to this place that a billionaire once was at. Like, that's-- I mean, that's inspiring. It's moving.
[292.27 - 312.18] NEIL DRUMMING: I don't know. Maybe I'm being-- I've been thinking about it a lot. And like, why has my interest been sparked so much recently? I've always loved science fiction, right? But the idea that, like-- the idea of black people in science fiction appeals to me now because of that notion of telling your own story, because the way black people are talked about, it's often a bleak future.
[312.18 - 313.46] IRA GLASS: And a bleak present.
[313.46 - 317.86] NEIL DRUMMING: Yeah, yeah. A bleak present and maybe no future at all, you know what I mean?
[317.86 - 318.26] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[318.26 - 338.13] NEIL DRUMMING: And so, I mean, think about-- I don't know. I mean, I don't-- maybe not everyone feels this. But I've been watching. There's just a lot of videos of terrible things happening to black people. I mean, it's literally, like, almost a genre. And there's got to be a parallel narrative, you know what I mean? There's got to be a parallel narrative.
[338.13 - 359.20] NEIL DRUMMING: And I think for me, the parallel narrative is Afrofuturism. And so, I don't know, it's a way of feeling like-- it's so hard for me to say this without laughing at myself. But it is genuinely hopeful. It's like a way of feeling hope.
[359.20 - 382.65] IRA GLASS: We sit on a curb way too long talking about this and finally head inside the comic bookstore. It's bright and spacious and smells great, like fresh coffee, decked out in posters for Wonder Woman and Spidey and X-Men and Moongirl. The store was busy because Afrofuturism enthusiast and author William Jones was there to give a lecture on the history of black people in comic books. He popped a slide of a comic book cover from the '60s onto the screen
[382.65 - 403.20] WILLIAM JONES: This is 1966. Now we have the introduction of the Black Panther-- not affiliated with the political organization. And the reason why I say that is because Marvel Comics recognized that maybe people are going to think we support the Black Panther Party. So they briefly change his name to the Black Leopard. It didn't last, and folks were not buying it.
[403.20 - 426.22] IRA GLASS: Most of the crowd is black. And nearly every adult Neil and I talked to was familiar with the basic ideas and iconic figures of Afrofuturism, including the owner, Ariell Johnson, a super-energetic 34. She and Neil talked about the subject for a while, and it became clear that for Neil, Afrofuturism is really about the future. But for Ariell, it's about the present, something she sees everyday.
[426.22 - 439.36] ARIELL JOHNSON: Black people today, black people who are alive and walking around, it's like, we are Afrofuturism. There's a quote that says, "I am my ancestors' wildest dreams." And I think that's true.
[439.36 - 461.31] ARIELL JOHNSON: It's like, when we think about our history in this country from when we were first brought here and the condition that they were in, you know, the freedoms that we have now, the things that we are working to accomplish and achieve, those are only things that they could have dreamed about in their wildest dreams. They could not have imagined-- it's like, I own this store, you know what I mean?
[461.31 - 472.50] ARIELL JOHNSON: So I am Afrofuturism. You are Afrofuturism. The fact that we're walking around, we are defying and challenging stereotypes and negative images.
[472.50 - 488.94] IRA GLASS: It's been a hard week for stereotypes and negative images. And it's been a brutal week for the past returning into the present. Mobs of men carrying torches, people arguing about Confederate statues and George Washington's slaves. It's been a week where lots of us have wondered about the future in this country and where things are going.
[488.94 - 499.32] IRA GLASS: Against that, today, we pose another way to see the world, another way to look at the future and the past that puts it in some context and helps us make sense of things, maybe gives us a little hope.
[499.32 - 501.96] IRA GLASS: I'm joined in the studio right now by my colleague. Neil, hello.
[501.96 - 502.53] NEIL DRUMMING: Hey.
[502.53 - 510.30] IRA GLASS: Hey. OK, so my thinking is-- well, our thinking is, since I know really very little about this, about Afrofuturism, and you know, like--
[510.30 - 512.03] NEIL DRUMMING: I think I know a little bit more, quite a bit more.
[512.03 - 518.55] IRA GLASS: OK. So our plan is that I'm going to go away, at least till halfway through the show, and you will stick around.
[518.55 - 525.42] NEIL DRUMMING: Yeah. No, I've just been-- I've been writing pieces and talking to people all over the country about this. So I feel like I have a little bit of a grasp on it.
[525.42 - 533.07] IRA GLASS: OK. All right, so I'll see you halfway through. Till then, I'm going to throw some sci-fi here. You have the conn.
[533.07 - 541.31] NEIL DRUMMING: I appreciate that. All right, stay with us.
[541.31 - 569.64] NEIL DRUMMING: Act One, "Metropolis Now." I started really puzzling over Afrofuturism a couple of years ago, when I went to an Afrofuturism conference in New York. Up until that day, I'd mostly heard the term used to refer to musicians like Sun Ra, or to science fiction by Samuel Delany or Colson Whitehead. But at this conference, there were Afrofuturism artists, designers, programmers, filmmakers, fashionistas, healers, yoginis. There was even a woman selling homemade hot pepper sauce in the lobby.
[569.64 - 593.28] NEIL DRUMMING: I began to realize that Afrofuturism wasn't an art movement in the way that I thought of, like, Cubism or Impressionism. It wasn't static or rigidly defined. The people at this conference who were so liberally applying the word were doing so because they thought it made their work seems somehow more active and vital. But I didn't understand exactly how.
[593.28 - 605.68] NEIL DRUMMING: As the term became more ubiquitous and The New York Times used Afrofuturism to talk about Beyonce's wardrobe changes, I was still trying to figure out the essence of the thing. Like, what makes something Afrofuturist?
[605.68 - 631.94] NEIL DRUMMING: I called the woman who'd given the keynote address back at that conference in 2015, activist and writer Adrienne Maree Brown. Adrienne told me that if I wanted to see Afrofuturism that I should visit her hometown, Detroit, Michigan-- a post-apocalyptic city, she'd said. The auto industry is nearly gone, the city's infrastructure is crumbling, many people can't afford basic resources like water and light. It's like the setting for some dystopian sci-fi story.
[631.94 - 657.47] NEIL DRUMMING: As soon as I started reading up on the place, I came across this headline in the Detroit Metro Times. "Inside Ingrid LaFleur's Afrofuturist mayoral campaign." Wow. There was a woman running for mayor of Detroit, and the basis of her platform wasn't socialism or libertarianism. It was Afrofuturism. So I flew out there to hang out with her. I got to hear her do some fundraising, give a speech, talk to some potential voters, and we drove around.
[657.47 - 660.32] INGRID LAFLEUR: And see all the different types of architecture here.
[660.32 - 680.99] NEIL DRUMMING: Ingrid is striking, impeccably styled and glamorous, yet still very bohemian, with a shock of gray in her perfectly coiffed hair. She pointed out her favorite landmarks. We visited a compact urban farm where they make something edible called Afrojam. We rode past a spot in Detroit's North End, where George Clinton's band Parliament-Funkadelic played one of his most iconic albums.
[680.99 - 690.92] INGRID LAFLEUR: George Clinton did create the Mothership Connection in Detroit, and he performed it here on Oakland Avenue, which is the street that we're on right now.
[690.92 - 699.31] NEIL DRUMMING: Taking a reporter around and bragging about your hometown is what you'd expect from anyone running for mayor. But it wasn't long before Ingrid the Afrofuturist showed up as well.
[699.31 - 718.13] INGRID LAFLEUR: The mothership is this wonderful symbol of our future space. And for me, it's this reminder of this empowering future space that can-- the possibilities of that and how it's always present.
[718.13 - 748.91] NEIL DRUMMING: We were talking about stuff I knew. I grew up listening to Parliament records too, and reading the comics on the album covers. I always thought it was cool, groundbreaking stuff. But when Ingrid talked about it, she scaled it up to something more grand and spiritual and a little esoteric. To be honest, I found her a bit difficult to follow on this and other topics. But with her enthusiasm, she was just fun to listen to. And anyway, I came to Detroit to find out about Afrofuturism, and here she was-- someone super-eager and ready to talk about it, whether or not what she said made sense to me.
[748.91 - 758.41] INGRID LAFLEUR: But my orientation, even within Afrofuturism, has always been cosmic. I'm a cosmic person.
[758.41 - 759.98] NEIL DRUMMING: Here she is discussing time.
[759.98 - 770.47] INGRID LAFLEUR: Time can be defined in 20 million different ways. It can go diagonally up, it can go diagonally down, below our feet-- and just like in the universe, right?
[770.47 - 772.46] NEIL DRUMMING: And here she is on the subject of lunch.
[772.46 - 787.74] INGRID LAFLEUR: Pleasure has to resonate all through the future, through your movement, into your world. A pleasurable experience for me eating-wise would be eating a great green salad.
[787.74 - 819.85] NEIL DRUMMING: I'm going to time travel a little myself here and let you know that Ingrid LaFleur did not win the primary. She never even got on the ballot officially. When I was there, with the election rapidly approaching, she was still sorting out her policy points. She talked to me vaguely about reviving Detroit's creative economy to rival the glory days of Motown and about the city's litter problem. Two days before the primary, she published a more thorough plan that called for, among other things, a universal basic income for Detroiters paid partly in digital currency. I guess that's pretty futuristic.
[819.85 - 859.06] NEIL DRUMMING: But at the heart of Ingrid's campaign was an idea that I found far more compelling than any specific policy she put forth. In her plan for Detroit, she writes, "In order to manifest true revitalisation, we must consider the histories and oppressions of the black American population. The foundation of every institution, government, police, education, the museum, was built to silence, disallow, displace, and render powerless black Americans. These institutions were never created for black Americans to truly prosper. It's time for a new plan."
[859.06 - 873.97] NEIL DRUMMING: That's not something you hear from many politicians. But it makes sense here, because Detroit is 80% black. Fixing the city means fixing it for black people. Ingrid sees Black Americans as the protagonists in the story of Detroit, its future and its past.
[873.97 - 882.82] INGRID LAFLEUR: When I was growing up, people loved to say it was, like, 110% black. It was super-black. It was just black.
[882.82 - 903.31] NEIL DRUMMING: This is the other thing about Ingrid. Maybe she's idealizing, I wouldn't know. But she carries a shining vision of Detroit's past with her everywhere she goes. We drove past vacant houses and empty lots. So much of Detroit is falling apart, neglected or abandoned. But underneath it all, she still sees a vibrant city, populated with a thriving black middle class.
[903.31 - 923.17] INGRID LAFLEUR: I grew up walking through this park at dusk. There would be people riding bikes, jogging, playing squash at dusk-- like, it's getting dark. And my mother and I, we felt completely comfortable and safe walking through these woods.
[923.17 - 942.73] NEIL DRUMMING: In the car, we talked about Afrofuturism. At one point, I told her about the conference that I'd been to, and how by now I'd heard the word Afrofuturism used to describe everything from comic books to condiments. But it wasn't coming into focus for me. I was starting to wonder if it was just a term for putting a positive spin on anything a black person has ever done or will ever do.
[942.73 - 946.53] NEIL DRUMMING: Like, I was moved by the optimism that seems inherent in Afrofuturism.
[946.53 - 946.86] INGRID LAFLEUR: Yes!
[946.86 - 952.10] NEIL DRUMMING: But I was also like, if it's everything, then what is the point of it?
[952.10 - 991.26] INGRID LAFLEUR: But that is the point-- imagining a more healthier present and future, and kind of recontextualizing the past so that it's empowering instead of victimizing. It's our way of not only surviving, but it's also a way of healing within the moment because there's constant traumas that we're dealing with-- historical and present day. So it's a way of allowing ourselves to shape-shift, to accommodate whatever comes our way.
[991.26 - 1012.26] NEIL DRUMMING: Ingrid eventually dropped me back at my hotel. Earlier, she'd given me a greasy brown bag containing a cookie which I now finally got around to eating. It turned out to be the most delicious gluten-free cookie I had ever tasted. But I was still feeling hungry and a bit confused by our conversation. Whatever bigger point she had been making about Afrofuturism, I was afraid that it had been lost on me.
[1012.26 - 1037.82] NEIL DRUMMING: I went looking for a burger and a stiff drink to mull it over. At a bar, over bourbon, I met a guy that I'm going to call Sam, with dark skin and hints of gray in his sideburns that betrayed his boyish face. He was dressed for a night on the town-- light blazer, Burberry shirt, patterned silk scarf. I asked him and another patron, both Detroit residents, if they'd heard of Ingrid LaFleur for Mayor. They hadn't.
[1037.82 - 1055.03] NEIL DRUMMING: When Sam got up to pay his check after we'd only been talking for a few minutes, he surprised me by asking if I wanted to go with him to check out some of the other spots around town. I wasn't dressed for it and I'd left my recording equipment in my room, but what the hell? Sam said it was OK for me to describe what happened next.
[1055.03 - 1080.62] NEIL DRUMMING: Sam had a nice car, a Mercedes. It never cost him more than $10 to park it in a lot. He loved that about Detroit-- parking was so cheap. He'd moved here from New York sometime in the late '90s and fallen hard for the city. As we drove, he talked up the real estate. He talked about his job and the IT business he ran out of his home. Things seemed to be going well.
[1080.62 - 1093.99] NEIL DRUMMING: We met up with Sam's friend, Rick, a bald, bearded, alpha male type in a reddish leather jacket, and followed him in his new BMW to a place called The Griot. It was the type of establishment once commonly referred to as grown and sexy.
[1093.99 - 1116.92] NEIL DRUMMING: Rick ordered another round of bourbon and some wings and flirted with the bartender. By now it was clear that these guys were looking to meet women. And that was weird because of this thing that Sam had told me earlier while we were in the car together. He'd said that not too long ago, his wife had gotten sick, and he'd taken care of her for a year. And then she died, leaving Sam and their teenage son with only each other.
[1116.92 - 1138.75] NEIL DRUMMING: Sam didn't actually want to be doing what we were doing tonight. This is, like, only his second time out as a single man. He didn't feel ready to meet women, to date. But he also felt like it was time. He couldn't wait forever. So he was doing what he felt like he had to do to move forward.
[1138.75 - 1153.28] NEIL DRUMMING: Sam and Rick took me to a few different spots that night. But the one that I remember the most was a place called Floods. From the outside, it looked like a common family restaurant. I thought it was closed until we rounded the corner and saw the cluster of people leaving their cars with the valet.
[1153.28 - 1184.12] NEIL DRUMMING: Inside, Floods was huge. Sam said it was probably about 2,500 square feet. A massive bar separated two rooms. At one point, there was both a band and a DJ playing simultaneously. And wall to wall, there were well-dressed, grown-up black folks dancing and singing along to classic soul, funk, and R&B. It reminded me of how Ingrid had described the Detroit she grew up in and its thriving black middle class. 110% black, she had said. Super-black, just black.
[1184.12 - 1194.24] NEIL DRUMMING: I'd been drinking all night. So yeah, I was already a little in my feelings. But I swear, I teared up at the sight of it all.
[1194.24 - 1205.53] NEIL DRUMMING: Sam hadn't wanted to come to Floods at first because he thought too many people would recognize him. I think he didn't want to be judged for being out on the town after his wife's death. And when we walked in, he seemed a little uncomfortable.
[1205.53 - 1243.40] NEIL DRUMMING: We split up for a while, and later he found me standing in a corner at the edge of the dance floor, mesmerized. He pulled out his phone and showed me the number he had just gotten of a beautiful woman who walked in earlier and drawn quite a bit of attention. Earlier in the day, Ingrid had said a bunch of Afrofuturist stuff to me about Detroit, shapeshifting, and reckoning with its past, and healing. I felt like I was seeing some smaller version of that now with Sam. Most days, he was probably just a guy in some pain, struggling to survive this very traumatic thing that happened. But tonight, in spite of that, Sam was imagining a better future and doing something about it.
[1243.40 - 1258.85] NEIL DRUMMING: He smiled, shouted some words of encouragement at me over the music, and waded back into the crowd. His spirits were up. His evening wasn't over.
[1258.85 - 1263.26] NEIL DRUMMING: [MUSIC - "RIGHT IN" BY BRYCE DETROIT FEATURING COKO BUTTAFLI]
[1263.26 - 1280.41] NEIL DRUMMING: nan
[1280.41 - 1297.04] NEIL DRUMMING: Act Two, "Past and Perfect." So there's this idea that occurs over and over in Afrofuturism that, summed up, basically says, the past is always with us. It affects us. It has the power to make us stronger if we learn how to use it properly.
[1297.04 - 1310.02] NEIL DRUMMING: Some West African cultures represent this idea with the image of what's called the Sankofa bird. It's a bird walking forward but with its head looking backward, meaning no matter what, we carry the past with us into the future.
[1310.02 - 1331.34] NEIL DRUMMING: In one of the most well-known Afrofuturist novels, Kindred by Octavia Butler, the main character finds herself traveling back and forth between her normal contemporary life in the present and the world of her ancestors in the Antebellum South, where she's treated like a slave. And the two time periods start to merge. That's fiction. Our next story is told by a woman who went through a version of that in real life.
[1331.34 - 1350.27] AZIE DUNGEY: When I graduated from NYU with a BA in Drama and a mostly unplanned double major in Anthropology, my mother asked me, what are you going to do with that, act in a museum? This seemed especially rude coming from a sociologist, but she had a point. For the first few years of my adult life, that's exactly what I did.
[1350.27 - 1374.44] NEIL DRUMMING: During those years, Azie Dungey was living in her hometown, a suburb of Washington DC, working as an actor at night in plays for which she was paid almost nothing. And to make some extra cash for Christmas, she took a gig, time-traveling to the least desirable job of the 18th century. She was a slave, or she played one anyway, performing for tourists at George Washington's estate, Mount Vernon, for weekend events called Mount Vernon by Candlelight.
[1374.44 - 1411.86] AZIE DUNGEY: The halls of the mansion were decked for Christmas. Visitors would walk through, stopping in each room to meet a character and hear their monologue about the season. There was Mrs. Washington, beloved wife, Dr. James Craik, Washington's physician and best bud, Nellie Custis, sweet-natured granddaughter, and me, Caroline Branham, slave. I had a script that I used to talk about Caroline's life. It was short. Besides the odd "I'm a slave at Christmas too, a slave to my husband and kids" joke from 40-year-old white women, people were interested and respectful.
[1411.86 - 1442.21] AZIE DUNGEY: After Christmas, I decided to stay in the job. It started out fine. The winter weather meant the visitors were mostly local and relatively few. I enjoyed my daily walks on the treelined lanes, soft snow falling on my hooded, mulberry-colored cape, as I looked out at the stunning view of the Potomac River. And when it was too cold, I would stay in the library and read through musty old books and primary source letters and notations that helped me understand this distant world I inhabited and the woman I portrayed.
[1442.21 - 1497.77] AZIE DUNGEY: I was Caroline Branham, a real woman who had been housemaid to Mrs. Washington. I studied Caroline's life and times for months. And every day, when I put on a beautiful crimson dress with tiny yellow and green flowers, I became her. With each eyelid I laced on my corset, I felt myself get closer to her posture, how her body related to the world. With my hair pulled back in two large French braids under a bonnet, I sat on a bench and set my fingers to the work Caroline did-- rows of stitches on shirts and brightly colored embroidery. I could picture her laying down her head at night, next to her husband Peter and their six children-- Wilson, Rachel, Jemima, Leanthe, Polly, and little Peter. I imagined how she hoped that one day they would wake up in a world better than the one she'd been given.
[1497.77 - 1523.95] AZIE DUNGEY: Then spring came, and tourists from around the country started pouring into Mount Vernon. My job was to simply be available to the visitors, to talk to them and answer their questions as Caroline. This time, there was no script. And I realized pretty quickly that just being there, existing as a black woman in that place, was a threat to the fantasy of a noble America. I was the stain on George Washington's white house.
[1523.95 - 1558.74] AZIE DUNGEY: And I watched them grapple with this right in front of me-- me, the least confrontational human being you'll ever meet. I mean, it took me until I was 25 years old to tell my mom I did not liked her baked tofu smothered in Kraft barbecue sauce. Some people were so uncomfortable with me that they bumbled through the first random thing that came to their mind. You're a slave? Oh, OK. So are the vegetables in the garden real? Fake vegetables. This is an outdoor garden. They are literally coming out of the ground, and there's a man standing there watering them.
[1558.74 - 1578.51] AZIE DUNGEY: Or they immediately asked questions with obvious answers that they just hadn't thought through. Why don't you go up to Massachusetts and go to school instead of being a slave, one person asked? Right, as soon as I can get rid of this very obvious brown skin, steal a horse and a map that I can't read, I will be on my way.
[1578.51 - 1596.42] AZIE DUNGEY: Or they'd go into immediate denial mode, like the old woman who out of nowhere yelled at me, George Washington had no slaves. I said, yes, he did. She responded, no he didn't. And this went on, back and forth, until her son got embarrassed and pulled her away.
[1596.42 - 1607.74] AZIE DUNGEY: Or they offered another offense as some sort of defense. But the Irish were slaves too. OK, that's not really true, and what the hell does that have to do with me?
[1607.74 - 1631.29] AZIE DUNGEY: And of course, there were those who would take the opportunity to teach me instead. You know, slavery was a good industrious life where you got room and board for your work. Mm-hmm-- a one-room cabin they built themselves with eight people sleeping on a dirt floor and a bag of corn meal every week. Room and board.
[1631.29 - 1652.83] AZIE DUNGEY: It was just a bizarre situation to be in, playing Caroline. I'd be sitting next to Miss Nellie in the midst of her roleplay, who'd be going on and on about the lovely letters that her dear grandpapa, George Washington, had written her, or all the fancy soirees that she attended. We'd be in the greenhouse with a gorgeous garden outside on an estate that overlooked the Potomac.
[1652.83 - 1675.72] AZIE DUNGEY: I'd literally hear white visitors sigh, listening to Miss Nellie read from her letters, full of nostalgia for this time long gone. They'd talk about how much simpler things were back then, how touching George Washington's letters were, what a fine man, and how lucky Miss Nellie was to live such a charming life. It was charming. I was charmed by it.
[1675.72 - 1712.77] AZIE DUNGEY: Then it'd be my turn. Here's what I talked about-- how my husband is rented from Mrs. Washington's relative and how he could be sent back at any time, how I go home to my cabin at night, hoping that none of my children have been sold, that once my friend was whipped so bad her fingers were torn and she couldn't sew for three weeks-- all real stuff from Caroline Branham's life. One time, an old lady just walked up to me while I was talking, hugged me, whispered "I'm sorry," and walked away. Another time a man handed me a $20 bill, so I guess that was reparations.
[1712.77 - 1766.89] AZIE DUNGEY: In Caroline's day, there were typically no more than 10 white people who lived in the Washington household at any given time. Meanwhile, there were 316 slaves. And who was there to tell their story? Me. I was the only black actor. So I felt like it was up to me to be all 316 people, to research them too, so I could talk about my friend the blacksmith or Delphi, the wool spinner. I learned so much about being a slave that to this day there is space in my brain devoted to this information. Like, I can tell you how to shine silver with horse urine, which herbs to use to make your owner sick but not kill her, how beating a slave and then dousing them with salt water to disinfect the wounds was called pickling. Pickling-- I hate that I know that.
[1766.89 - 1799.19] AZIE DUNGEY: As my time at Mount Vernon went on, I began to notice there was something that would happen in particular with white men. It was, like, almost despite themselves, they would act out the power dynamic from 1797. I can remember at least five times when a white man of a certain age sat on a bench way too close to me and said something like, I used to be into a black girl, back when I was young. Then he would pause, presumably waiting for my response. What am I supposed to say to that, exactly, thank you?
[1799.19 - 1827.27] AZIE DUNGEY: Once a man got physical. I was walking down the lane on a particularly hot and busy day when a tall, burly white man grabbed my arm, pulled me towards him, and said, show me where you're branded. I was startled and could only get out the words, sir, I haven't been branded. And then he and his wife began laughing heartily. Well, you got it good up here. We're from South Carolina, and they branded them down there. Girl, you got it good.
[1827.27 - 1851.81] AZIE DUNGEY: And then one time, one of the guys I work with, also in costume, wearing a tricorn hat, he and I were walking from the farm back to the mansion, and we decided to take the forest trail. We were having a nice, normal conversation when out of the blue he says, hey, let's re-enact a slave race. You tear up your clothes a little bit and go running out the forest screaming, and I'll follow behind you pulling up my pants.
[1851.81 - 1874.07] AZIE DUNGEY: He laughed. I didn't say anything. I just sort of tittered. I [BLEEP] tittered. That's an old-timey, fancy way of saying I laughed with the bastard. I laughed because I didn't know what else to do, because I felt completely and utterly powerless.
[1874.07 - 1906.14] AZIE DUNGEY: I started calling in sick a lot because I was sick a lot. My stomach would twist and turn. I would sometimes get a choking feeling and cough as if to vomit, but nothing was there. I had terrible headaches, and I couldn't do anything but sleep. And one day it occurred to me that Caroline felt this way too, this exact way. The farm manager who oversaw slaves on the Mansion House Farm noted that Caroline, quote, "complained of a pain in her head and side," and had, quote, "a very dry bad cough."
[1906.14 - 1924.06] AZIE DUNGEY: George Washington's friend, Dr. Craik, is recorded as having treated her for such bad stomach pains that he had to bleed her, give her stomach drops, and prescribe 20 pills for bowel obstruction. My job was to inhabit Caroline's life, but she started inhabiting mine.
[1924.06 - 1950.55] AZIE DUNGEY: I had this weird sensation that I was living in multiple time periods at once, like the Sankofa bird. I started seeing Mount Vernon everywhere in the modern world. An evolutionary psychologist wrote a blog post for Psychology Today, where he claimed that he objectively proved that black women are the least attractive of all races of women with science. This happened in the year of our Lord 2011.
[1950.55 - 1977.22] AZIE DUNGEY: I saw this only a few days after reading Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia for work. Apparently Jefferson-- who, by the way, was known to have slaves with the lightest skin possible-- had come to the same conclusion about my race and gender over 200 years ago. He said that black men prefer white women, and black women are preferred by orangutans. Oh, so that's why I'm single.
[1977.22 - 2003.06] AZIE DUNGEY: Then, Trayvon Martin. I was watching the news one evening about a black boy harassed and pursued by a white Latino man who was convinced that he didn't belong in his neighborhood. And because of this compulsion, the innocent black boy ended up dead. My heart was in my gut. The first thought that came into my head, he didn't have his pass. Pass? I shook it off. No, that can't be right.
[2003.06 - 2035.40] AZIE DUNGEY: When a slave left their plantation, they had to carry a pass from their master or overseer saying where they were going and when they were expected to return. Not having your pass, or your free papers if you were free, was dangerous. At any time, any white person could stop you and demand to see your pass. If you didn't produce it, you were thrown in jail. Having black skin alone was enough to make you suspicious, and a white stranger could be the judge and jury of your fate. Trayvon Martin didn't have his pass.
[2035.40 - 2049.63] AZIE DUNGEY: There's a thing white people say to black people all the time. I've had it said to me. Why don't you just get over it-- "it" being slavery and all historical oppression. Why don't you just get over it, they say. It's in the past.
[2049.63 - 2073.44] AZIE DUNGEY: What I would say to white people in response is that you're not over the past. Every year you flock from all over the country to Mount Vernon and other places like it, to monuments and museums and reenactments. There's President's Day and the fireworks that blast over George Washington's house every 4th of July. There are the Confederate flags and statues of Robert E. Lee that you don't want taken down.
[2073.44 - 2085.57] AZIE DUNGEY: No, I can't get over it. And neither can you. None of us can.
[2085.57 - 2096.28] NEIL DRUMMING: Azie Dungey. These days, she's a writer for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and writing a book of essays about her experiences at Mount Vernon called How I Survived the 18th Century.
[2096.28 - 2099.73] NEIL DRUMMING: [MUSIC - "WAKE UP" BY FUNKADELIC]
[2099.73 - 2114.03] NEIL DRUMMING: nan
[2114.03 - 2126.68] NEIL DRUMMING: Coming up, we warp from the past back to the future, to Daveed Diggs and an underwater world of tomorrow. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.
[2126.68 - 2141.95] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, "We Are in the Future," a show inspired by Afrofuturism, which my colleague Neil Drumming has become interested in as a lens to view the future, the past, and the present. Hey there, Neil.
[2141.95 - 2147.77] NEIL DRUMMING: Hello again. So in case you were wondering, the title of this week's show comes from an album by Sun Ra.
[2147.77 - 2152.45] IRA GLASS: I am not wondering that, because I've sat in on our own story meetings. But continue and explain to the people.
[2152.45 - 2170.90] NEIL DRUMMING: Sorry. I didn't mean to black-splain you, Ira. So anyway-- so, the title for this week's show comes from an album by Sun Ra, We Are in the Future. He mostly did experimental jazz. That's what he's known for. But the piece we're going to play right now, "The Space Age is Here to Stay," is a little more gospel. It's a little more call and response.
[2170.90 - 2187.16] SUN RA: It's going to be like your ancestors said, even though they are cold and dead. Space age is here to stay. The space age is around to stay. Yeah, the space age is here to stay. Space age is here to stay.
[2187.16 - 2188.96] IRA GLASS: Which brings us to Act Three.
[2188.96 - 2190.98] NEIL DRUMMING: Act Three, "The Black Sea."
[2190.98 - 2201.37] IRA GLASS: So this one I know about. There's this hip hop group called clppng. that's Bill Hutson, Jonathan Snipes, and Daveed Diggs-- who, listeners might know, Daveed Diggs is on the soundtrack to Hamilton. He plays Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.
[2201.37 - 2222.33] IRA GLASS: And we commissioned clppng. to write a sci-fi story for us, a song. And what they made was a tribute to a Detroit band from the '90s called Drexciya. And Drexciya had created this whole mythology in their band. And the mythology was based on the idea that pregnant African women on slave ships were sometimes thrown overboard.
[2222.33 - 2260.73] IRA GLASS: And Drexciya imagined that the babies survived and learned to live and thrive underwater and that the babies founded a black Atlantis under the sea. And so in this song that clppng. wrote for us, the civilization under sea was living peacefully for centuries, unaware that humans were above on land until those of us who live on the surface, we intruded on their underwater civilization by firing seismic air cannons into their world looking for oil. And then they kind of slowly, over the course of the song-- you heard they slowly rise to the surface psyching up for war. So you'll hear the air cannons, you'll hear them come to the surface. Anyway, you'll hear it all. Here's the song.
[2260.73 - 2264.13] IRA GLASS: [MUSIC - "THE DEEP" BY CLPPNG.]
[2264.13 - 2268.02] IRA GLASS: nan
[2268.02 - 2282.38] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember how deep it go. Start it from the bottom. Y'all remember how deep it go. Fore y'all had to come back.
[2282.38 - 2297.59] CLPPNG.: Deep. Y'all remember when it used to be deep. So deep. So so deep. When y'all swam up out your momma while your momma was asleep. So deep. So so deep.
[2297.59 - 2305.24] CLPPNG.: And y'all remember when you had the dance floor lit. Dark. No two step. Deep. Y'all don't even sweat. Deep.
[2305.24 - 2312.41] CLPPNG.: As deep as it gets. Dreaming dead asleep and keeping time. Y'all heartbeat. Deep. Y'all heartbeat. Deep.
[2312.41 - 2342.63] CLPPNG.: And all the fishes had they eyes bugged out 'cause y'all dancing underwater, and y'all don't get wet. And the dark smells sweet. And y'all tails touch reef. Y'all feed off the bottom. But now y'all remember. Y'all remember. Y'all remember.
[2342.63 - 2347.99] ROBOT VOICE: Pressure outside the vehicle, 832.2 bars.
[2347.99 - 2359.82] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when the deep got hot, when y'all moved on up, how y'all used to argue about the water getting warmer. Still y'all loved a little bit of light up in the deep. So deep. So so deep.
[2359.82 - 2371.86] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember saying how it couldn't be them two legs 'cause y'all came from two legs, and y'all mommas would have loved y'all if they could have breathed, but they wasn't ready for the deep. So deep. So so deep.
[2371.86 - 2390.76] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when the first blast came. And the beat fell off. And the dreams got woke. And the light bent bad. And the fishes belly up. And them coral castles crumbled because they wasn't quite enough. And conversation used to break, like the floor quake, like the bleached bones.
[2390.76 - 2412.93] CLPPNG.: And the finned friends fled from they home. But the blast wouldn't stop, 'cause they wanted black gold. And them no gills had to feel it 'cause they couldn't be told. Y'all remember. Y'all remember.
[2412.93 - 2421.15] ROBOT VOICE: Ocean salinity, 35 PSU. Water pH, 7.91.
[2421.15 - 2427.92] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when the regime change, that no please no calm seas let the water rise. So deep. So so deep.
[2427.92 - 2435.70] CLPPNG.: Oil slick upon the sleeper was an awful thing to realize. If the two legs want to wake the dead, they gon have to bring more fire. Y'all is closer to the earth. So deep.
[2435.70 - 2446.99] CLPPNG.: And y'all was talking how to get up in they heads and got to being real inspired. Circumstances of the birth has got you feeling like an army. Better yet a navy. And Dagon gave y'all the blessing. Now y'all going crazy. They live with green upon the surface, but they ain't deep.
[2446.99 - 2471.67] CLPPNG.: That pistol shrimp will knock a two leg off his feet. Y'all perfecting the steam void to rip up the ships. They using Sonar as second language. Y'all fluent with it. And all the dreamers is woke now and nightmares swim. But everybody heard that bloop, know y'all coming for them. Y'all remember. Y'all remember.
[2471.67 - 2477.10] ROBOT VOICE: Surface water temperature, 308 Kelvin.
[2477.10 - 2481.38] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when the call went out? No deep. No more deep. Sunshine.
[2481.38 - 2485.96] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when the call went out? No deep. No more deep. Sunshine.
[2485.96 - 2489.42] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember feeling wind upon your skin? No deep. No more deep. Sunshine.
[2489.42 - 2493.25] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember how it burned in the beginning? No deep. No more deep. Ride on 'em. Ride on 'em. Ride on 'em.
[2493.25 - 2501.32] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember seeing sun across the surface on the day that y'all first came upon the water. So so deep. How the breaking of the surface showed the sky without a border, and the air was so much hotter. So so deep.
[2501.32 - 2509.31] CLPPNG.: How the woke dreamers screamed and it rose tides. And the waves stretched up like a mountain high. And the no gills gasped, and they closed eyes. And they prayed to their gods and they asked why.
[2509.31 - 2524.80] CLPPNG.: And then y'all cried too, 'cause y'all recognized momma in the faces of the ones that y'all would terrorize. They were sisters and brothers. They were the babies born up out the water, not connected to each other, not a knowledge of the one drop. But they had to learn today. Y'all had one shot. Let the sun burn today. Let 'em feel the dark even deeper today. Make a two leg a believer today.
[2524.80 - 2532.89] CLPPNG.: Let 'em know that they done woke a sleeper from a sleep. So deep. That y'all been dancing without any feet. So so deep. Is the nerve that they struck with the blast that they broke with the drill that they burnt with the gas.
[2532.89 - 2534.54] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember. So deep. Sunshine. Ride on 'em.
[2534.54 - 2536.51] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember. So deep. Sunshine. Ride on 'em.
[2536.51 - 2538.60] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember. So deep. Sunshine. Ride on 'em.
[2538.60 - 2545.78] CLPPNG.: Y'all remember when y'all had to let 'em breathe. Ride on 'em.
[2545.78 - 2562.28] ROBOT VOICE: Initiating tidal wave sequence, Uniform Romeo 030.
[2562.28 - 3385.34] IRA GLASS: Daveed Diggs, with Bill Hutson and Jonathan Snipes, are clppng. clppng.'s latest album, about a slave ship in space, is called Splendor and Misery. Their website is the band's name, which is the word clipping without the vowels, clppng.com.
