[0.50 - 21.23] IRA GLASS: It's been a week for looking at pictures, of the bombings in Boston, of course, the aftermath, the FBI suspects, everything that's happened since. By Wednesday, a few people in our office were going onto Reddit, the online discussion board, to read the conversation where amateurs were scouring through those crowd photos of hundreds of faces, searching for anybody who might be a bomber. Zach Barnett was one of those amateurs.
[21.23 - 37.18] IRA GLASS: And he was a skeptic. He started Tuesday morning. When posters started chattering about a guy in the crowd that they nicknamed Music Man, a guy who was wearing headphones, a black jacket with a huge black backpack-- it was the huge backpack that made him suspicious-- Zach was the person who alerted everyone.
[37.18 - 49.26] ZACH BARNETT: There was an image after the bombing had taken place with tons of ambulances on the scene. And there was what seemed to be Music Man with his backpack. And so this seemed to suggest that he was not responsible.
[49.26 - 54.54] IRA GLASS: Because if he has the backpack after the blast, obviously, it's not his backpack that caused the blast.
[54.54 - 56.07] ZACH BARNETT: Right. Right.
[56.07 - 78.28] IRA GLASS: After this display of level headedness, Zach, who is a college student, was asked to be one of the moderators of the discussion on Reddit. There's been some criticism of Reddit for going through Boston Marathon photos looking for suspects. The Atlantic called it vigilantism and made it seem like these were crazed nerds on a delusional CSI witch hunt. And you definitely can find quotes that make it seem that way.
[78.28 - 93.41] IRA GLASS: But if you read the full discussions, you'll see how careful people are trying to be, very aware of the dangers of accusing an innocent person of being a bomber. It's a big part of the discussion. When somebody posts the Facebook page of one potential suspect, people declared, this has gone too far.
[93.41 - 106.20] IRA GLASS: The post is deleted. The poster's banned. And Zach was far from the only skeptic. Take, for example, the discussion of a pair of guys they called the Backpack Brothers because one of them had a big, heavy looking black backpack.
[106.20 - 116.86] ZACH BARNETT: And he was wearing a white hat with some glasses on top of the hat. And then there was another man in blue track suit and running shoes, which isn't exactly out of place at a marathon.
[116.86 - 118.92] IRA GLASS: And he has a duffel bag, right?
[118.92 - 121.91] ZACH BARNETT: Yeah. He had a duffel bag over his shoulder.
[121.91 - 155.77] IRA GLASS: There were a couple things about the Backpack Brothers photos that made Zach feel like of all the pictures, these had the greatest likelihood to be real suspects. Somebody linked to this ingenious photo which superimposed the shot of the Backpack Brothers on the sidewalk before the explosion with a picture of the same stretch of sidewalk after the bombs went off, with a big red circle drawn at the spot where the bombs supposedly had blown up. And damned if it wasn't exactly next to where those two guys had been standing. And even more damning were other photos taken still before the blast.
[155.77 - 165.38] ZACH BARNETT: Where one of them definitely didn't have his bag. The person with the white hat did not have his bag with him. And the other one, you couldn't really tell if he did or didn't.
[165.38 - 174.09] IRA GLASS: And so the speculation is they had bags before the blast. And then later, still before the blast, they had left their bags somewhere.
[174.09 - 194.44] ZACH BARNETT: Exactly. And based on the time of when the images were taken, which you could see the marathon clock in the photo, it did line up with roughly when people thought that the bags had been dropped. And so this led people to really be suspicious of these two.
[194.44 - 221.98] IRA GLASS: But by Wednesday, people at Reddit were discussing the details that would make you less suspicious of these two. Like, for example, the duffel bag was blue. Authorities never mentioned a bomb in a blue bag. Or, most important, except for the white cap, these two guys did not match the description of the suspects that authorities started to circulate by Wednesday afternoon. So by the end of the day Wednesday, most posters on Reddit, including Zach, seemed to be moving away from the Backpack Brothers as possible bombers.
[221.98 - 242.01] IRA GLASS: Of course, this wasn't true everywhere. On Thursday morning, the New York Post blasted a photo of the Backpack Brothers across its front page-- it's the entire front page-- with a screaming headline, "Bag Men. Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon." Somehow, the Post didn't notice that these two men do not match the description of the suspects that was circulating by then.
[242.01 - 264.42] IRA GLASS: By Thursday afternoon, authorities had publicly declared that these two men were not suspects. Photos of the real suspects were released. The Backpack Brothers turned out to be a high school sophomore, who was very surprised at all this attention, and his friend. And on Thursday when I talked to Zach about all the various photos, he was super careful not to jump to any conclusions, which, of course, is difficult.
[264.42 - 268.14] IRA GLASS: It just is so hard to look at these pictures without imposing a story on it.
[268.14 - 276.74] ZACH BARNETT: Yeah, exactly. You just can't help but read the photograph, not just see it for what it is but to read a story on to it.
[276.74 - 285.61] IRA GLASS: Like here at our office this week, it was hard for all of us to not feel like, oh, look, look, it's him. It must be him. This must be the guy. And were you having feelings like that, too?
[285.61 - 309.67] ZACH BARNETT: Oh, yeah. You can't help it. When people are posting all these images, and there's this person circled, and there's an arrow drawn from this person to this person saying, oh, these two are working together. And the danger is not even just that people are going to speculate and jump to conclusions that are unwarranted, but really what's going to happen when you jump to unwarranted conclusions. Who's going to be affected?
[309.67 - 345.70] IRA GLASS: A picture is what you think it means. It is not self-evident. And today on our radio show, we have two stories where there are pictures. And in each of them, whether you think the pictures are worrisome and troubling depends on what you believe about the story of how they were made. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Two mysteries will unfold. Stay with us.
[345.70 - 362.67] IRA GLASS: Act One, Photo Op. It's no surprise that people disagree about how to interpret the photos and videos in this first story, because the photos and videos were shot in a part of the world where people disagree about how to interpret so, so many things. Nancy Updike tells the story.
[362.67 - 384.07] NANCY UPDIKE: I saw a video a while back that caught my attention. It's short, a shaky handheld video. And it shows an interaction between Israeli soldiers and a Palestinian family where there is no violence, no yelling, no confrontation. In the video, five Israeli soldiers show up at the house of a Palestinian family in a village named Nabi Saleh.
[384.07 - 398.30] NANCY UPDIKE: It's around 1:00 in the morning. The father answers the door, and he starts to film what's happening. And the soldiers let him film. The soldier in charge asks the man in Hebrew if there are any children in the house and how many.
[398.30 - 399.64] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[399.64 - 400.56] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[400.56 - 402.09] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[402.09 - 411.05] NANCY UPDIKE: The man's got four children, three of whom are here at the house now. The little girl is at her grandfather's. How many sons, the soldier asks. Three.
[411.05 - 412.02] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[412.02 - 413.56] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[413.56 - 414.68] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[414.68 - 423.65] NANCY UPDIKE: The soldier asks to see the two oldest boys, 15 years old and almost 12 years old. The man says they're asleep. And the soldier asks him to wake them up, please.
[423.65 - 425.51] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[425.51 - 428.63] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[428.63 - 439.02] NANCY UPDIKE: The man goes into the next room and calls his kids' names a couple of times. Again, it's around 1:00 in the morning. The kids lift up their heads, blink in the light, and slowly get out of bed.
[439.02 - 453.45] NANCY UPDIKE: They stand next to each other in the doorway of their room looking at the soldiers, who are in full gear, helmets, guns. The younger boy has dark blond hair, and his face is a little puffy with sleep. When the soldier in command says hello, he says his name, Muhammad.
[453.45 - 454.38] SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[454.38 - 456.42] SOLDIER: (SUBJECT) MUHAMMAD TAMIMI Muhammad.
[456.42 - 468.02] NANCY UPDIKE: The soldiers write down the boys' names and ID numbers. And then they take a photo of each kid. They've already taken a photo of the father.
[468.02 - 480.49] NANCY UPDIKE: During the whole process, no one offers or asks for a warrant, a charge, an explanation. As the soldiers leave, the one in command glances at another door in the building and says, any more children? The father says no.
[480.49 - 490.73] NANCY UPDIKE: The only question the father asks is, can he go with the soldiers and keep filming while they go to the next house? They say no at first. And he says, why not? So they let him.
[490.73 - 510.05] NANCY UPDIKE: I watch the unedited video he made that night, and I counted 12 more houses that the soldiers went to, waking up kids and photographing them. The undrama of this video is mesmerizing, the routineness, like watching a series of traffic stops. I've been coming to the West Bank reporting on and off for 15 years.
[510.05 - 524.03] NANCY UPDIKE: And I've been here when the routine was suicide bombings in Israel and in the West Bank, tanks and daily shootings. But it hasn't been like that for a long time. And the army taking photos of kids at night is something I'd never seen before.
[524.03 - 539.33] NANCY UPDIKE: Watching the video, I felt like it was a window into this moment in the West Bank, this period of quasi-stability. Israel went into the West Bank 46 years ago. What does it take to control so many people so effectively for so long?
[539.33 - 562.79] NANCY UPDIKE: And I know that lots of Americans feel like they have no right to ask questions about what Israel does, because they're not there, and they don't know what it's like to live with the dangers Israelis live with. But what Americans never seem to realize is how much Israelis ask questions, including about this video of soldiers photographing kids. The video aired on Israel's Channel 10 and also made the rounds on Israeli Twitter feeds and Facebook pages.
[562.79 - 570.91] NANCY UPDIKE: And plenty of people who saw the video said, well, the army's got to do what the army's got to do. But others were disturbed. They had questions.
[570.91 - 600.07] NANCY UPDIKE: And why shouldn't they? It's their sons and daughters who are in the West Bank or wherever else right after high school for years of mandatory military service. So I've got a question. What are these nighttime photos? The photos at night aren't new. It's a tactic that comes and goes, part of something the Israeli military calls mapping.
[600.07 - 603.66] YEHUDA SHAUL: This is mapping. In the middle of the night, the guy is in his pajamas.
[603.66 - 626.02] NANCY UPDIKE: Yehuda Shaul did his army service during the Second Intifada years ago. But he did a lot of mapping. And he's talked to a lot of other soldiers about it. He's showing me a snapshot taken by a soldier in 2008 in the West Bank city of Nablus. And the photo shows an older Palestinian man, who seems to be in his pajamas, sitting at a table in his house across from an Israeli soldier who's writing something down on a piece of paper.
[626.02 - 636.16] YEHUDA SHAUL: Yeah, basically, the ID numbers of the people who live, the names, drawing who works where, cell phones, all the kind of stuff that you collect in mapping.
[636.16 - 648.60] NANCY UPDIKE: Mapping is actually a general term that can mean a lot of different things-- photographs, diagrams of the layout of a house, where the windows and balconies are, what doors lead to which streets. Mapping's not violent, and months can go by without any mapping.
[648.60 - 664.47] NANCY UPDIKE: So it's not something that usually makes the news. It's just one more part of the overall routine in the West Bank these days. The mapping and nighttime photos started in Nabi Saleh, the village from the video you heard, a few months after the villagers began doing a weekly protest march, according to residents.
[664.47 - 674.80] NANCY UPDIKE: These protests are also part of the routine in the West Bank. They happen every Friday. They happen in lots of villages. They've been happening in different villages for years. And there's practically a script.
[674.80 - 686.23] NANCY UPDIKE: In Nabi Saleh, the day I was there, there was a march, chanting. The villagers faced off against some soldiers. And after an hour or so of this, a lot of the adults left.
[686.23 - 711.18] NANCY UPDIKE: But the bulk of what happens every Friday is what comes next, kids throwing stones. It goes on for hours. It's become the Friday afternoon activity for a lot of kids and teenagers in Nabi Saleh. Teens sit with friends by the side of the road talking and rough housing and then occasionally picking up a stone throwing it or launching it with a slingshot. The soldiers, on their side, respond with tear gas, rubber coated metal bullets.
[711.18 - 712.68] NANCY UPDIKE: [SHOT SOUND]
[712.68 - 724.56] NANCY UPDIKE: Two men have died from injuries they received at protests in Nabi Saleh in the last year and a half. But today, there's a lot of pretending to be fearless. One kid made a joke of acting like he'd been hit.
[724.56 - 727.13] BOY: [YELLS].
[727.13 - 751.42] NANCY UPDIKE: At this point, throwing stones is one of the most common charges against Palestinian kids who are arrested in the West Bank. There are Palestinians throwing stones just about every day, not only at protests and not only at soldiers. A few weeks ago, a Palestinian was convicted of throwing stones that killed an Israeli father and his baby when they were driving in the West Bank. A stone hit the father in the head, and he lost control of the car.
[751.42 - 784.09] NANCY UPDIKE: The army takes stone throwing seriously, whether the stones are being thrown at armored jeeps or unarmed civilians. Soldiers videotape the weekly protests. And in Nabi Saleh, the villagers told me the army does that so that it can take those images and compare them to the nighttime photos. That way, the army can arrest people who throw stones and go to demonstrations. It's safer and easier for the army to arrest people at night rather than at the demonstration itself, though arrests actually might not be the point of the nighttime photos.
[784.09 - 789.48] NADAV BIGELMAN: My officer tells me-- he told me before we left, bring your camera.
[789.48 - 811.90] NANCY UPDIKE: This is Nadav Bigelman. He was an Israeli soldier who took photos in mapping operations similar to ones in Nabi Saleh, He's 24 years old, and his army service ended in 2010. But his unit operated in villages that were also holding protests. Nadav said he'd just started his army service, and his commander told him to bring along his little Fujifilm camera one night to do some mapping.
[811.90 - 834.84] NADAV BIGELMAN: You know, it was like my first few duty line after basic training and all that. I thought I'd have, like, the most important intelligence material. Yes, I thought someone would come and ask for these pictures. I think, in my mind, this is the most logical thing to do, that someone, I don't know, intelligence, will ask for these pictures.
[834.84 - 854.05] NANCY UPDIKE: But no one ever did ask for the pictures. Not only that, but Nadav says he later learned that all of the information they'd gathered, the ID numbers, the drawings of the layouts of the houses. all of it had gone in the trash. Nadav was a young soldier-- 19 years old. He didn't question why. He just deleted the photos.
[854.05 - 865.90] NANCY UPDIKE: Another soldier in Nadav's unit, Sagi Tal, confirmed that this happened. And Sagi said that over the course of his three-year army service, he saw the same thing happen again and again with mapping operations.
[865.90 - 871.27] SAGI TAL: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[871.27 - 901.24] TRANSLATOR: One of the ways that I came to understand that this was just an exercise in futility was that every time a new battalion would come in and be in charge of a certain area, they would order this mapping procedure all over again. And so it became clear to me that these photos weren't being used and didn't go into some kind of database the way we were lead to understand they would be.
[901.24 - 905.52] NADAV WEIMAN: In my unit, we called that kind of operations "Condoleezza Rice operations."
[905.52 - 913.21] NANCY UPDIKE: This is another soldier also named Nadav, Nadav Weiman. He was serving in 2008 when Condoleezza Rice was Secretary of State.
[913.21 - 916.33] NADAV WEIMAN: Because every time Condoleezza Rice came to Israel, we did that.
[916.33 - 917.59] NANCY UPDIKE: You did a mapping operation?
[917.59 - 918.43] NADAV WEIMAN: Yeah.
[918.43 - 945.35] NANCY UPDIKE: I thought Nadav Weiman might have had a different experience with mapping than other soldiers because he was in a special forces unit, and he was in charge of intelligence for his team, a sniper team. And he did have a different experience. The army sent him to a photo course and gave him a camera, a Nikon D200 with seven lenses. But when it came to mapping, it was the same with him as with other soldiers. He got back with all the photos and the information and the diagrams, went to his superior--
[945.35 - 958.50] NADAV WEIMAN: And I said, OK. There's all the maps and the photos and everything. And he said, Nadav, erase the photos and just throw the papers to the trash can. And don't ever come to me again with all the papers, because you don't need to do that.
[958.50 - 959.86] NANCY UPDIKE: Were you surprised?
[959.86 - 973.83] NADAV WEIMAN: Yeah, I was very surprised, because the first time we did that, we did it really seriously. You know, we asked, and we drew really accurate and everything. And then we understood that it doesn't really matter.
[973.83 - 987.79] NANCY UPDIKE: He says after the first time he did mapping, he just threw everything away automatically. I heard this, and I didn't understand. Why get all that information and photos and then throw it away? And why keep doing that over and over?
[987.79 - 1010.24] NANCY UPDIKE: I went back to Yehuda Shaul, the guy who first explained mapping to me and showed me the photo of the man in his pajamas. Again, Yehuda did his army service years ago during the Second Intifada. But he's been in touch with hundreds of soldiers since then, because after he finished his required army service, he and some others started an organization called Breaking The Silence that interviews Israeli soldiers about their experiences.
[1010.24 - 1035.12] NANCY UPDIKE: Besides doing mapping himself, Yehuda's heard mapping stories from dozens of IDF soldiers-- Israel Defense Forces soldiers-- including ones who are serving now. And he wasn't surprised by what Sagi and Nadav and the other Nadav told me. He said it was the same for his unit in Hebron. They mapped the old city of Hebron twice, then destroyed all the data on the orders of their commander without ever passing it on or doing anything with it.
[1035.12 - 1042.14] YEHUDA SHAUL: Look, very quick you understand that mapping is just another form of making your presence felt, right?
[1042.14 - 1044.81] NANCY UPDIKE: Making your presence felt. That's a phrase. It's a--
[1044.81 - 1057.43] YEHUDA SHAUL: Yeah. [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. Demonstrating your presence. The idea is very simple. Every Palestinian feels that the IDF is always right here, you know?
[1057.43 - 1061.28] NANCY UPDIKE: You're pointing right to the back of your head behind your left ear.
[1061.28 - 1066.57] YEHUDA SHAUL: Yeah, yeah. We're breathing behind you. We're always there. We're always watching.
[1066.57 - 1077.63] YEHUDA SHAUL: You never know where we're going to be, when we're going to show up, how it's going to look like, what we're going to do, when it's going to start, when it's going to end, right? So what do you do to make them feel this way? You make your presence felt.
[1077.63 - 1086.07] YEHUDA SHAUL: But this is not a tactic. This is not a strategy that distinguishes between good guys and bad guys, right?
[1086.07 - 1090.60] MUHAMMAD TAMIMI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
[1090.60 - 1102.13] NANCY UPDIKE: I spent an afternoon talking to seven boys who were photographed in Nabi Saleh, the village where I saw the weekly protest. Most had been photographed more than once. Some had later been arrested. Some hadn't.
[1102.13 - 1117.10] NANCY UPDIKE: One of the kids I talked to was the younger boy from Bilal Tamimi's video, his son, Muhammad. Muhammad was almost 12 when the soldiers took his picture. He's just turned 14. But he seems young for his age. He didn't act tough or indifferent when I asked him about soldiers taking his picture.
[1117.10 - 1120.97] MUHAMMAD TAMIMI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
[1120.97 - 1134.33] TRANSLATOR: I was surprised that they were there. This is the first time that they entered our house. I had thought about it a lot before but never expected it to happen.
[1134.33 - 1149.00] NANCY UPDIKE: Muhammad's mother told me that he and his older brother worried in the weeks afterward that soldiers would come back. His older brother started sleeping in jeans and keeping his shoes next to the bed in case he was arrested in the middle of the night. Muhammad didn't like to sleep at all.
[1149.00 - 1154.19] MUHAMMAD TAMIMI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
[1154.19 - 1162.40] TRANSLATOR: I started staying up late, watching for the coming of the soldiers.
[1162.40 - 1183.18] NANCY UPDIKE: His mother told me that for months she would wake up at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning to the sound of the TV. And she would find Muhammad awake, half watching TV and half watching out the window to see if anyone was coming. Muhammad never was arrested, and neither was his older brother. But soldiers did come again to the house. Like before, it was around 1:30 in the morning.
[1183.18 - 1202.51] NANCY UPDIKE: And just like before, his father, Bilal, videotaped it. Bilal's had video cameras since he was a teenager. But a few years ago, he got a better one from an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem. Now he's got a video archive organized by date of the times the Israeli military has come into the village over the last couple of years.
[1202.51 - 1203.37] SOLDIER 2: Sit please.
[1203.37 - 1204.65] BILAL TAMIMI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
[1204.65 - 1217.81] NANCY UPDIKE: In this video, everyone has been woken up and is sitting in the kitchen. And one soldier is walking around with Bilal doing a search, asking him, in English this time, whether he has anything illegal or forbidden in the house.
[1217.81 - 1221.14] SOLDIER 2: Do you have something who is unforbidden?
[1221.14 - 1221.95] BILAL TAMIMI: Unforbidden? Like what?
[1221.95 - 1226.53] SOLDIER 2: Yes. Like knives. Like weapons.
[1226.53 - 1229.17] BILAL TAMIMI: I have a lot of knives and the spoons in the kitchen.
[1229.17 - 1230.60] SOLDIER 2: The kitchen is OK--
[1230.60 - 1243.02] NANCY UPDIKE: In case you didn't hear it, Bilal is saying, I have a lot of knives and spoons in the kitchen. The soldier says, the kitchen is OK. I've got knives in my kitchen, too. The soldier keeps walking around with Bilal, questioning him.
[1243.02 - 1245.12] SOLDIER 2: Do you carry a weapon?
[1245.12 - 1247.48] BILAL TAMIMI: Weapon? This is my weapon.
[1247.48 - 1250.18] NANCY UPDIKE: Bilal points to his camera as he says this.
[1250.18 - 1252.24] SOLDIER 2: OK. It's a good weapon.
[1252.24 - 1253.48] BILAL TAMIMI: Yes.
[1253.48 - 1285.94] NANCY UPDIKE: Again, no one in the house is under arrest. The soldiers are just looking around, asking to see the older son's backpack, looking in cabinets and on shelves, asking more questions, and finally leaving. For sure, there are people in the West Bank who want to kill Israelis. Nadav Weiman, the special forces guy, showed me a photo he took after his team raided the house of a Palestinian man who had a workshop inside to build bombs.
[1285.94 - 1291.32] NADAV WEIMAN: And we found a lot of ammunition and things inside his house and bombs and everything.
[1291.32 - 1299.84] NANCY UPDIKE: Nadav says the raid on that house was based on intelligence. And Israel has an incredible amount of information about who and what are in the West Bank.
[1299.84 - 1327.05] NANCY UPDIKE: They've got cameras, informants, listening devices, drones, undercover units. And Nadav says that over the course of his three-year army service, the conclusion he came to, based on his own experiences and conversations with other soldiers, including his two older brothers who are also special forces, was that some operations really were about gathering and using intel. He would go out and take reconnaissance photos, and they would be used.
[1327.05 - 1363.77] NANCY UPDIKE: But he says those operations, even for his elite team, were the exception. He believes that a lot of what they did, including most mapping operations, fell into a different category, the "demonstrating our presence" category. And in that category was a whole range of things from mapping to something else he says his team did called mock arrests. Other soldiers also talked about this. And a mock arrest is exactly what it sounds like, arresting someone who's not really under arrest. Even more than that, Nadav said before his team went out to do a mock arrest, they would call the Shabak, Israel's internal intelligence agency.
[1363.77 - 1373.29] NADAV WEIMAN: And we'd say to them, we want to go to do mock arrest in that house. And we give the number of the house, because there's maps and all the houses are numbered. And they check.
[1373.29 - 1385.52] NADAV WEIMAN: And they have information about all of the Palestinians in West Bank. And they give us the OK, because if everybody in the house is innocent and not connected to terror, they say, OK, you can go.
[1385.52 - 1394.56] NANCY UPDIKE: Let me underscore what he's saying here. He said his team could only do a mock arrest after Israel's intelligence service told them that no one in the house is suspected of wrongdoing.
[1394.56 - 1409.50] NADAV WEIMAN: And we'd go in the middle of the night, and we surround the house. And we shout, come out with your hands in the air. And we throw stun grenades, or we fire bullets at the walls of the house. Or we throw smoke grenades.
[1409.50 - 1423.18] NADAV WEIMAN: And then somebody comes out and is afraid, and he doesn't know what is happening. And we arrest him. And we shout a lot in Hebrew and Arabic. We arrest him. We put him inside a Jeep. And then we do like two or three rounds--
[1423.18 - 1424.22] NANCY UPDIKE: Driving around the village.
[1424.22 - 1444.43] NADAV WEIMAN: Driving around the village. And then after, like, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, maybe the whole night, we put him back inside his house and drove away from there. And the goal in that operation, the goal is creating the feeling of being chased in the Palestinian population.
[1444.43 - 1458.80] NANCY UPDIKE: To create the feeling of being chased in the Palestinian population was an explicit goal that Nadav says he saw many times typed out in the PowerPoint presentation his team would be shown before a mission, right there along with all the other official information.
[1458.80 - 1487.55] NADAV WEIMAN: Our team, our names, who is the officer, and what is the goal of the operation, and how we're going to do it, it's all written. And it's written to create the feeling of being chased in the Palestinian population just like that. That's the mission that I was sent. And you see that a lot of things I do in the West Bank as a soldier, I'm not here to protect Israel. I'm here to control Palestinians.
[1487.55 - 1499.07] NANCY UPDIKE: I ran all this by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military, the Israel Defense Forces. I quoted to him the objective Nadav Weiman said he saw typed out before some missions.
[1499.07 - 1504.91] NANCY UPDIKE: "To create the feeling of being chased in the Palestinian population."
[1504.91 - 1533.39] PETER LERNER: I would not consider that a military objective at all. And when we do carry out military operations, a specific target would be to arrest an individual to gather intelligence for a specific mission. It would not be just to intimidate anybody. I would rule that out to begin with. Again, if there was a low-level commander making such a statement or event putting it in writing, it could be a mistake.
[1533.39 - 1540.82] NANCY UPDIKE: I told Colonel Lerner about the mock arrests Nadav Weiman and other soldiers said they'd done. I asked him what's the purpose of a mock arrest.
[1540.82 - 1548.58] PETER LERNER: I can't even comprehend that type of term. When we carry out an arrest, we carry it out. We take the person. We take them for questioning. It could be a short questioning.
[1548.58 - 1559.80] PETER LERNER: You ask them a few questions. You see if there's any basis for further investigation. And he could be released. It wouldn't be a mock. I would say that that definitely not be how we operate.
[1559.80 - 1562.05] NANCY UPDIKE: You've never heard that term?
[1562.05 - 1563.80] PETER LERNER: No.
[1563.80 - 1565.21] NANCY UPDIKE: About mapping, he said--
[1565.21 - 1576.54] PETER LERNER: In the past, we did military operations to map out populated areas to find out who's living where and who's doing what. I'm not aware of throwing data out or throwing intelligence out.
[1576.54 - 1577.70] NANCY UPDIKE: Never. You've never heard of that?
[1577.70 - 1596.11] PETER LERNER: No. I doubt that would be the situation. It would defeat the object. We don't just send troops out just to go out. We safeguard our own safety. We don't send people and put them at risk. And we would look at every mission in a professional manner.
[1596.11 - 1626.33] NANCY UPDIKE: The years since the Second Intifada ended, around 2006, have been the quietest in a long time for Israelis, with some brutal exceptions. People don't worry about getting on buses the way they used to or try to find tables in cafes far away from the door in case a suicide bomber gets in. So you could argue that creating the feeling of being chased in the Palestinian population has worked, that mapping is important to Israel's security. And it doesn't matter whether data is kept or not.
[1626.33 - 1645.04] NANCY UPDIKE: But mapping and mock arrests are just a small part of things in the West Bank. For the last few years, there's been this intense cooperation between Palestinian Authority security forces and Israeli security forces. And Israel's built a barrier, a series of fences and walls, in much of the West Bank.
[1645.04 - 1666.55] NANCY UPDIKE: Those things probably have a lot more impact on Israeli security than sporadic mapping operations. But then what's hard to calculate is the downside of mapping or mock arrests. What does it do when anyone, innocent or guilty, can be woken up by soldiers in the middle of the night along with their kids?
[1666.55 - 1682.74] NANCY UPDIKE: The soldiers who came to Bilal Tamimi's house and photographed his kids were notably polite. It's part of what makes the video compelling, the disconnect between how they're speaking and what they're doing. All of the soldiers I spoke with talked about feeling aversion of that disconnect.
[1682.74 - 1695.80] NANCY UPDIKE: And these are all people who entered the army wanting to protect their country. They joined combat units and did tough service. Nadav Weiman, the special forces soldier, wanted to be on the front lines. He went into Lebanon.
[1695.80 - 1709.77] NANCY UPDIKE: He was two days away from his reserve duty when we talked. And yet, he and the others I talked to feel that a lot of what they've done in the army is deliberate intimidation of civilians. They don't believe it made Israel safer in the long run.
[1709.77 - 1733.81] NANCY UPDIKE: And, yeah, these are a select group. A lot of people, inside the army and out, don't see it this way. Nadav Bigelman, the guy who had mapping photos on his camera, told me about one night when his unit was given glow sticks, like kids buy at concerts, before they went out on their patrol. And their commander said to throw them into people's houses. Just toss them through open windows or balconies.
[1733.81 - 1758.26] NADAV BIGELMAN: And you can say, OK, it's not violent. It didn't harm anyone. But the idea is, again-- of course, just random houses, of course. The idea, again, is not the glow sticks but what the glow sticks make people think. I mean, just imagine, people wake up the next morning, prepare for school, to work, university, and they see a glow stick in the middle of their living room. And they understand the army was here.
[1758.26 - 1771.17] NANCY UPDIKE: That's how 46 years go by, sometimes with a heavy hand, sometimes with a light touch.
