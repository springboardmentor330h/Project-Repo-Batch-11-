[0.48 - 2.33] IRA GLASS: So say your name. Say who you are.
[2.33 - 9.46] SETH MOULTON: Sure. Seth Moulton, a congressman from the sixth district of Massachusetts. I should say, Seth Moulton, the congressman from the sixth district of Massachusetts.
[9.46 - 12.12] IRA GLASS: You added the "the." That's the difference between--
[12.12 - 12.95] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHING]
[12.95 - 15.14] SETH MOULTON: Because there's only one of me, so.
[15.14 - 19.55] IRA GLASS: And before you were a congressman, you served for how many tours in Iraq?
[19.55 - 22.82] SETH MOULTON: I did four tours in Iraq as a Marine infantry officer.
[22.82 - 40.94] IRA GLASS: Back in 2003, Seth Moulton was in the first company of Marines to enter Baghdad during the invasion. And once they liberated the country, one of his weirder assignments was to show the Iraqis how to start a free press and help them get uncensored news operations up and running. Up till then, the news media was just propaganda for Saddam Hussein.
[40.94 - 61.82] SETH MOULTON: And although my primary job was just to teach the Iraqis how to produce their own TV shows, we started doing some announcements, some messages ourselves. And this little thing that Mohamed and I put together-- he was my translator-- proved remarkably popular. Kind of a news commentary show, sort of like 60 Minutes.
[61.82 - 67.18] IRA GLASS: Wait, wait. Sort of like 60 Minutes? You mean, like you would investigate stories and run after people in the parking lot?
[67.18 - 103.85] SETH MOULTON: Right. Exactly. Exactly. So we'd go out and we'd hear people complaining about the electricity situation, and so we'd go to the power plant and say, what's going on here? And they'd say, oh, well, we've got a problem with the transmission lines. So then we'd go out and follow the transmission lines and see what was being done to fix them. And Iraqis had never seen this before. I mean, trust me. I didn't know how to put together a TV show. I mean, this was very low-quality stuff, but it was the best the Iraqis had ever seen. And it was far better than just getting these tapes from the Ministry of Information in Baghdad.
[103.85 - 117.54] SETH MOULTON: Before long, we were signing autographs in the street. We were getting fan mail. Everywhere we went, we had to pose for pictures. I mean, it was extraordinary. I'm a congressman now, and no one does that back home.
[117.54 - 138.17] IRA GLASS: But the success of that show led to a problem for his interpreter, Mohammed. As the years passed, an opposition to the Americans and the new Iraqi government increased. It became incredibly dangerous for any Iraqis who were working with US forces. People were getting killed. Their families were sometimes killed. Mohammed came to the United States on a Fulbright scholarship.
[138.17 - 149.64] SETH MOULTON: And his family said it's a death sentence for you to come home. They were receiving threats. They had to pick up and move their family to a new city because of the threats they received due to Mohammed's work with me.
[149.64 - 151.34] IRA GLASS: Due to him being on television with you.
[151.34 - 160.72] SETH MOULTON: That's right. They all knew Mohammed. They knew who he was. He was sort of like the local poster child for quote, unquote "collaborators with the Americans."
[160.72 - 168.47] IRA GLASS: While Mohammad waited to get asylum in the United States, he moved in with Seth Moulton's parents. Seth was actually back in Iraq on his fourth tour.
[168.47 - 170.51] IRA GLASS: Was he in your room?
[170.51 - 172.22] SETH MOULTON: I think he was technically in my brother's room, but--
[172.22 - 172.78] IRA GLASS: Your brother's room? OK.
[172.78 - 173.57] SETH MOULTON: Across the hall.
[173.57 - 176.94] IRA GLASS: I was wondering if your stuff from high school was still on the walls when he was there waiting for you.
[176.94 - 183.99] SETH MOULTON: I think it still is, so yeah. It was. I mean, my parents had an Iraqi son while their son was deployed to Iraq.
[183.99 - 184.52] IRA GLASS: Wow.
[184.52 - 190.80] SETH MOULTON: And he's really become like a son to them and like a brother to me. He comes to all our holidays, to Thanksgiving and Christmas.
[190.80 - 209.09] IRA GLASS: Mohammed was allowed to stay in the United States. But he's one of the lucky ones. Congressman Moulton hears about, and personally knows, other interpreters who have not been allowed here. And in fact, thousands of interpreters and others who work with the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are still back there. Many of them, their lives are in danger.
[209.09 - 216.83] IRA GLASS: And that's true, even though in 2008, a law was passed to expedite their entrance to the United States. It's frustrating, the congressman says.
[216.83 - 242.09] SETH MOULTON: I've been back and forth over email over the past few weeks with a very close interpreter from 2007, 2008, who's trying to come over with his family. We're still fighting. Still fighting to get him here. And you know, I wouldn't be here today, Ira, without my translators. They risked their lives to keep me and my Marines safe.
[242.09 - 252.26] IRA GLASS: And do you understand what is the holdup? Like, if these people are in the pipeline, how come so few of the slots that have been allocated for them are actually getting filled?
[252.26 - 276.12] SETH MOULTON: Well, I think there are some problems. I hear from a lot of veterans who have their own translators and say, hey, can you help my guy? Can you help my guy get in? And a lot of times they'll say, you know, I have statements from every Marine or soldier that he worked with saying that this is one of the most trustworthy guys I know, and yet, because they don't check some box for the State Department, they can't get through.
[276.12 - 290.57] IRA GLASS: The day I spoke with the congressman-- just a few weeks ago-- was the day the House was supposed to decide whether to renew the law that issues special visas to help these people who worked with the United States move to our country. He's on the House Armed Services Committee and he just heard the news.
[290.57 - 299.45] SETH MOULTON: Yeah, we've actually just found out that the final bill includes 1,500 additional visas, which is a step in the right direction.
[299.45 - 319.57] IRA GLASS: But the backlog is more than 13,000 people right now. So 1,500 visas was disappointing to him. He was hoping for a lot more. There was a lot more in the past. He says vets in Congress from both parties understand how important this is. He has Republican allies like John McCain. But he gets a lot of pushback from other people in Congress.
[319.57 - 328.89] IRA GLASS: And can you explain what's the argument on the other side for making the number of slots so low? When people argue with you and say, no, no. Let's make the number slots low, what do they say?
[328.89 - 367.20] SETH MOULTON: You know, it's just this anti-immigrant sentiment in the Republican Party. And unfortunately, it's from a lot of Republicans who haven't served overseas who don't understand how important this is. They say, oh, we can't trust these people, or we know of Iraqis and Afghans who want to kill Americans. Well, right, of course, but not the ones who put their lives on the line to work for us. I mean, these people took tremendous risks. They've taken greater risks for our country than these folks in Congress who are opposed to their immigration and have never served in our military.
[367.20 - 368.76] IRA GLASS: Do you say that to them?
[368.76 - 373.35] SETH MOULTON: Well, I try to be a little bit more diplomatic about it, but.
[373.35 - 374.35] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[374.35 - 389.70] SETH MOULTON: There's a lot of fear out there among my colleagues right now that Trump has been so successful with his crusade against immigration. People are afraid that if they stand up for a program like this it will be used against them in some future election.
[389.70 - 394.98] IRA GLASS: President-elect, of course, campaigned against allowing people from Muslim countries to come into our country.
[394.98 - 408.67] SETH MOULTON: Of course, my fear is that the Trump administration won't be willing to work with us at all. I mean, I don't think someone who-- I mean, what did Trump have, five deferments or something so he wouldn't have to go to Vietnam? I don't think that he's going to understand this at all.
[408.67 - 412.57] IRA GLASS: Yeah. Wait, are you calling him like a draft dodger?
[412.57 - 420.09] SETH MOULTON: No, I'm not calling him like a draft dodger. I'm calling him a draft dodger.
[420.09 - 422.15] IRA GLASS: What is going to happen?
[422.15 - 443.94] IRA GLASS: Over the years on our program, we have covered the stories of several different people who worked with US forces and tried to get relocated to America when they put their lives in danger. In the first half of today's show, we return to one of those people, to somebody who started trying to come here eight years ago. Yes, they've been at this for eight years. We wanted to understand what's going to happen to her now with this new administration arriving.
[443.94 - 456.39] IRA GLASS: In the second half of the show, we have the amazing and disturbing story of how we got to this point as a country. Like, why Congress authorized these special visas in the first place to solve this problem, and why they have not worked so well.
[456.39 - 482.09] IRA GLASS: A warning before we start that if you're listening with small American children, this is not a story that's going to make you feel good to be an American. But of course, it's always good to understand the facts, to see clearly what has happened and why. And we will do that now. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.
[482.09 - 487.47] IRA GLASS: Act One, Good Things Come to Those Who Wait, But Not Always.
[487.47 - 518.28] IRA GLASS: So the interpreter that this story's about is named Sarah. She worked with US forces in Iraq. But we know her because she worked with us, interpreting for our producer Nancy Updike in Iraq for about a month back in 2010 as we were putting together an episode about US forces pulling out of that country. Back in 2011, Nancy did a story about Sarah's attempts to get a visa to move to the United States. And that story resulted in a flood of emails from listeners who wanted to help in some way. Not that there was a lot they could do.
[518.28 - 523.65] IRA GLASS: Nancy's been in touch with Sarah on and off over the years. And she's checked back in with her this fall.
[523.65 - 539.83] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah spent most of December-- this December, just a few weeks ago-- working with a reporter going in and out of Mosul. That's the city Iraqi forces have been fighting to take back from ISIS. That's one of Sarah's skills, keeping her nerve in a dangerous place.
[539.83 - 561.59] NANCY UPDIKE: But the reason people open up to Sarah-- the reason they remember her-- is because, no matter what's going on around her, who she was before the war still comes through. This warm, chatty housewife, who, for most of her life, was raising her two boys, getting up every morning and putting on clothes that will be familiar to anyone who's ever spent the whole day at home.
[561.59 - 575.36] SARAH: Normally I was wearing in my house like, you know, a tracksuit and pajamas. And then a uniform.
[575.36 - 608.48] NANCY UPDIKE: The uniform was an American military uniform. And Sarah is laughing because she can still barely believe the arc of her adult life. She worked alongside US soldiers during one of the most violent stretches of the Iraq war. And she went straight into that having never worked outside her home in her life. So Sarah's story-- the story you're about to hear-- is about an ordinary woman with no heroic ambitions who took on a role for which she was the unlikeliest of candidates and thrived.
[608.48 - 629.59] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah started working as an interpreter as a last resort. The war had been going on for a few years already and interpreters were being targeted and killed because they were working for the United States. But Sarah was desperate. She and her family had been bombed out of their house, and her husband's business had been taken over by militias.
[629.59 - 646.24] NANCY UPDIKE: Even before the war, Sarah's marriage had not been happy. Her husband never let her work outside the home. Didn't even let her finish college. Now the family was broke and sometimes going hungry, including her kids, Mustafa, 16, and Baqir, who just turned 10.
[646.24 - 670.51] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah's husband refused to go out and look for work out of fear that he'd be killed. And people were being killed in the streets. But someone had to do something. Sarah took an English test at a US military base. She'd always been good at languages. She passed the test and was offered a contract with a starting salary of $1,150 a month. That was the good part of the contract.
[670.51 - 683.20] SARAH: The contract said 27 days in the camp and then four days vacation. So it's a very long time for me to leave my kids alone in the house.
[683.20 - 693.73] NANCY UPDIKE: So you would be living on the base with the Americans for 27 days and then get four days at home? You couldn't commute back and forth and see them at night, even?
[693.73 - 742.92] SARAH: No, no, no. So I really worried about this item in the contract. But yes, I start to work with them and I found myself in a room smaller than this one, alone. And I spend only one night and then I want to quit the next morning. Yeah. I wanted to take my bag and run away to my house because each time I hear the American soldiers in the back laughing and talking, I said, what am I doing here? This is not my place. My place is with my boys in the house. How can I just bear 27 days without seeing my kids?
[742.92 - 770.70] SARAH: And then one of the Iraqi interpreters, he saw me so confused, and I told him this is the first day for me. I want to quit. I want to leave. So he says, this is normal thing. We all felt the same way you feel now. So just relax and give yourself time.
[770.70 - 801.44] NANCY UPDIKE: Picture a woman in her late 30s with a wide face. 5 foot 3, but solid, not fragile. Huge smile. Now wearing fatigues, bulletproof vest, medic bag, wraparound shrapnel-resistant glasses, and a helmet. 40-plus pounds of gear. Sarah is her nickname. All Iraqi interpreters pick nicknames. The fewer people who know their real names, the better. She picked Sarah. It's easy to pronounce in English and in Arabic.
[801.44 - 829.10] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah was an interpreter for Alpha Company 177. But she did more than just interpret. She gathered key information that became intel for the unit. This was back during the surge. Baghdad was on the edge of all-out civil war and the surge plan was to send US military outfits like Alpha Company out into the middle of dangerous areas with constant IED and sniper attacks to try and stabilize them.
[829.10 - 856.31] NANCY UPDIKE: Alpha Company landed in southwest Rashid in Baghdad. At the time, it was a confusing churn of different militias, including the powerful Mahdi Army, the Jaish al-Mahdi, who were trying to control the area. Kidnapping and killing were common. And the only way for the Americans to fight was to get tips from informants, ordinary local people who were frightened all the time of the militias, of the Americans.
[856.31 - 870.25] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah's job was to try to convince these frightened people to talk. Her new boss, Captain Bill Higgins-- he's actually now a lieutenant colonel-- gave her an assignment. Call up this guy. He doesn't want to talk, but just try.
[870.25 - 916.67] SARAH: Try to talk with him. Try to ask him about the neighborhood. And I called him and I talked with him. I'm Sarah. I'm working with Americans, these things. And I asked him about the neighborhood, his neighborhood, and he started to give me his real name, his job, all the information about the bad guys in his neighborhood. So when I told the captain after I finished my call, he was really surprised. And he said, Sarah, we tried with him since six months. Tried to get even his name, and he refused to give it to us. This is something unbelievable.
[916.67 - 947.67] SARAH: It was the first time for me to recognize and realized that there is other things I can do in addition to be a housewife-- a good housewife. I start to feel all this energy inside me, all these good things inside me. So yes, there is something else. I can do it within the right way.
[947.67 - 977.30] NANCY UPDIKE: Lieutenant Colonel Higgins told me it really was unbelievable how good Sarah was at getting people to open up to her. They trusted her. They liked talking to her. Lieutenant Colonel Higgins felt that way. Sarah was approachable, sympathetic, funny, and unexpected, like running into your favorite sister or aunt in a war zone. Even though she was dressed in fatigues, as soon as she started talking, it was clear to people that she knew their world and she knew them. She used to be them.
[977.30 - 998.07] SARAH: Nancy, I spent 17 years in the kitchen, making food for the family and guests all the time. So this is like a big step for me to get out from all this thing to a new world.
[998.07 - 1033.53] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah's world flipped. Everything that had seemed overwhelming in the beginning became normal-- militias, informants, raids, IEDs, gunfire, dead bodies, and working around the clock. 27 days in a row of this. And then a mini vacation. Four days off-- and not even fully off. She gave trusted informants or sources her personal cell phone number. She found herself struggling to get back into the quiet rhythm that used to be her whole life-- making meals, cleaning the house, being a mom. You know, vacation.
[1033.53 - 1087.56] SARAH: The problem for me was, even when I was in my vacation, people keep calling me. And this didn't let me switch off all these things and be a mom instead of being interpreter. One of the times when I was in a vacation, Baqir asked me to do his favorite food-- chicken in the oven with rice, of course-- and at the same time, I got a call from a source. She start to tell me something so important about weapon caches in the area and I'm just holding the phone in one hand and try to put the tray in the oven.
[1087.56 - 1104.66] NANCY UPDIKE: Maybe you can see where this ends. She burns herself. She's still got the scar. But listen to her voice. She's thrilled. She wasn't just good at her job. She loved her job. On that phone call, the information she got while getting burned was so important, she left her vacation early.
[1104.66 - 1115.85] SARAH: It was really a big day for us. We captured about 18 leaders in the same night.
[1115.85 - 1144.12] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah became indispensable. Out of the four or five interpreters the unit worked with regularly, she was the top. She was the one that Lieutenant Colonel Higgins and his operations officer wanted at their meetings with local sheikhs and other leaders. They sought her opinion as well as her interpreting skills. And her work with informants was crucial. Lieutenant Colonel Higgins says he's certain that some of the people who called, especially women, would never have talked to a male interpreter.
[1144.12 - 1167.97] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah got letters of praise from military officers that were a effusive and consistent. They wrote, "her work has directly led to identifying many criminal actors and capturing them." "We've learned that Sarah is feared by local criminals." "Sarah unhesitatingly faced the same dangers as our soldiers." "She's earned the trust and confidence of everyone in the unit."
[1167.97 - 1185.43] NANCY UPDIKE: The letters also talked about how hard Sarah worked. Lieutenant Colonel Higgins sometimes let her kids come to the compound and stay with her for a few days when the long separations got too difficult. Her husband came a couple of times, too. Sarah later overheard him talking to the kids about it.
[1185.43 - 1199.09] SARAH: He said, I really shocked when I saw your mother do all this work all the time, day and night. So God help her and protect her.
[1199.09 - 1228.21] NANCY UPDIKE: The word empowerment has a quaintness about it now in the US as though it's forever rendered in a '70s-era font. But there's no other word for what happened to Sarah. She became empowered. She used to be embarrassed to talk to strangers. Now she could talk to anyone. And when she did, everyone listened. Her world had become huge. For Sarah, it was a change that would come at a staggering personal cost. And she saw others pay a price for their courage, also.
[1228.21 - 1231.97] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah called up a woman in the area one day at the captain's request.
[1231.97 - 1266.14] SARAH: He said, Sarah, this woman really has good information about a very bad area in the sector. We need her. I told her, I'm a mom too, and I have two boys, and I accept to do this work and it was very dangerous because someone needs to be serious with this area, with this country. It has to be me or you or anyone to bring the secure and the safe to the area.
[1266.14 - 1296.89] NANCY UPDIKE: The woman agreed to talk in spite of being frightened. She lived in a neighborhood where militia members often hid. From the back of her house, she could see what was happening on the main street-- people planting IEDs to catch US military vehicles. And from the front, she could see who and what was coming into the area. She was a great source, calling Sarah at home to tell her about weapons and militias. They became friends. And she told Sarah that the militias had a nickname for Sarah-- the Lion.
[1296.89 - 1303.40] NANCY UPDIKE: One day, the woman's husband called Sarah and said, they came and took her. Militia leaders took her.
[1303.40 - 1353.85] SARAH: I know the militias. They are savage. And they torture everyone. They don't care about a woman or a kid or anything. And I feel guilt. I thought maybe I am the reason for what she will suffer from. I just wanted to take her back to her kids and-- so I was like a crazy, talking, crying, and talking with the captain, begging him to find any way to go and try to find her. I called one of the double agents who work with the Americans and work with me.
[1353.85 - 1358.14] NANCY UPDIKE: Someone in the Jaish al-Mahdi who was working with you, working with the Americans?
[1358.14 - 1408.94] SARAH: Yes. And I begged him, just tell me where they will take her. Tell me about the places where you keep the kidnapped people. So we move from house to house, and all the houses were empty. We spent maybe two days searching for her. And then her husband called me and said, hey, Sarah, they called us and they said, we killed her. Really, it was-- every time I remembered her, I really said, she was the Lion, not me. I'm not. I wasn't the Lion. She was the Lion. Yeah.
[1408.94 - 1427.77] NANCY UPDIKE: In the beginning of 2008, after Lieutenant Colonel Higgins and his group had rotated out and a new group had come in, Sarah's husband joined the Sons of Iraq. These were groups of Iraqis the Americans paid to fight alongside them, especially against al Qaeda. Her husband was killed after less than a month.
[1427.77 - 1472.41] SARAH: He was driving his car in one of the streets where they put their checkpoints, and two cars drive beside his car with three men inside it, and they start to shoot on him and kill him in his car. I shocked, really. I start to cry. My boys jumped in my mind and I called Mustafa immediately and I asked him about Baqir and he told me, he is in the house with me. And I said, don't go anywhere because I will come to you. And I was crying and he was confused and asked me, what's going on? Mom, tell me what's going on.
[1472.41 - 1484.48] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah was horrified to learn from one of her informants that her husband was killed at least in part because of her work. The informant told her he saw militia members the day her husband died.
[1484.48 - 1499.47] SARAH: He saw them celebrate after his killing and distribute candies and laughing and call each other and congratulate each other. Hey, we killed Sarah's husband.
[1499.47 - 1519.43] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah started trying to get herself and her sons out of Iraq, to emigrate to the US for safety. With the help of Lieutenant Colonel Higgins and others from his unit, as well as people from the new group, she applied for a special visa-- one of the visas created by Congress specifically for people like Sarah who were working with the United States.
[1519.43 - 1538.23] NANCY UPDIKE: But in the fall of 2008, as she was waiting to do her first interview to get the visa, something totally unexpected happened. She was taken into custody, put in an American jail at the Baghdad airport. No idea why. She was questioned for days before she could figure out what was going on.
[1538.23 - 1560.12] NANCY UPDIKE: Sarah had been accused, anonymously, by another Iraqi of betraying the Americans she was working with. The accusation was that she had taken money from militias, had snuck militia members into the Sons of Iraq to spy on the Americans, and had interpreted inaccurately on purpose to help militia members get released.
[1560.12 - 1578.07] NANCY UPDIKE: To Sarah, these accusations seemed absurd. These militias she had supposedly helped were the same militias that had killed her husband and bombed her home. But it didn't matter if the accusations made sense. She sat in prison for two months before she got to defend herself in front of a judge.
[1578.07 - 1592.86] NANCY UPDIKE: The Iraqi judge threw the case out for insufficient evidence, but it took another month for the paperwork to go through. And incredibly, in that month, her situation got worse. She was transferred from the American jail into Iraqi custody.
[1592.86 - 1613.20] SARAH: And really it was a terrible experience for me there in the Iraqi jail. I don't want to remember anything. That jail makes my hair grey, really.
[1613.20 - 1636.19] NANCY UPDIKE: Those three months undid her. Not only the jails. Sarah had been keeping all her savings in a bag in her room at the camp where she'd worked with the Americans. Banks hadn't felt safe. Iraq was still unstable. And she hadn't wanted to leave it at her house. When her son Mustafa went to go pick up her things from the camp while Sarah was sitting in jail, the money was gone.
[1636.19 - 1645.00] SARAH: I said, no way. There was all my saving money in the bag. He says, no, Mom. The bag was empty.
[1645.00 - 1661.09] NANCY UPDIKE: About $20,000 disappeared, she says. The family had lived frugally the entire time Sarah was working so she could save most of her paycheck. It was money she'd planned to use for them to emigrate, if necessary. Now they didn't even have it to live on.
[1661.09 - 1706.15] NANCY UPDIKE: There was a final blow. Even though the case against her had been dismissed and Sarah had an exemplary work record, she had been blacklisted. The anonymous accusations that a judge had thrown out for lack of evidence and that she herself has never seen to this day became part of her US Defense Department file. The technical term is derogatory information, and apparently the anonymous derogatory information in Sarah's file outweighed all the letters of praise and support signed by US military people who had worked and lived with Sarah for months. So even though her case was thrown out of court for lack of evidence, she was no longer allowed to work for the US, and her visa to America was denied.
[1706.15 - 1744.77] NANCY UPDIKE: Derogatory information isn't uncommon in these cases. And it could be anything-- a genuine threat, a misunderstanding, a grudge. I talked to Richard Welch, a US Army colonel who's now retired. He was in Iraq for almost seven years during the war, and he spent a lot of time assessing the validity of accusations against Iraqis who worked for the US. He also had detailed knowledge of Sarah's case. He saw her security file and the derogatory information in it. He called her case quote, "a shameful situation and a gross miscarriage of justice." He does not think she's a threat.
[1744.77 - 1763.52] RICHARD WELCH: I remember every unit she worked with vouched for her credibility and her trustworthiness and her ability. I just think it's outrageous. I mean, honestly, it's just not American to frankly do that to these folks.
[1763.52 - 1790.44] NANCY UPDIKE: I first met Sarah in 2010, about a year before the US declared the war officially over. Another reporter, Larry Kaplow, and I were working together and Sarah was our interpreter. There was a moment in the This American Life episode that Larry and I put together when Sarah was on the air as herself, not just interpreting for someone else. It was less than a minute long, but she was the person everyone remembered at the end of the show.
[1790.44 - 1800.56] NANCY UPDIKE: The moment happened when Sarah was interpreting for us during an interview with a former Sons of Iraq fighter. He pulled a tissue from a box next to him to make a point.
[1800.56 - 1825.93] SARAH: [CRYING] I'm sorry. He says the American forces use us like a tissue. I feel the same thing. I'm sorry.
[1825.93 - 1855.09] NANCY UPDIKE: When Sarah worked for the United States, she didn't cover her face with a mask the way some interpreters did because she knew that people talked more if they could see her face, if they could see who they were talking to. And we, the United States, needed people to talk. So Sarah's face is known to the militia leaders she helped the US question and put in prison. Some of those militia leaders were released from prison after the US left.
[1855.09 - 1900.32] NANCY UPDIKE: Five years ago, Sarah re-applied to come to the United States for herself and her sons. And in that time, her interview with US immigration officials has been scheduled and then canceled three times. And a whole group of people-- military personnel who worked with Sarah, lawyers who took on her case, reporters she worked with, and Sarah herself-- all tried to figure out what the hell was going on. We asked USCIS, the United States Citizen and Immigration Services, to explain why Sarah's case has dragged on so long, so extraordinarily long. More typical is two years. All the spokesman would say is that USCIS can't discuss the details of individual immigration cases.
[1900.32 - 1919.82] NANCY UPDIKE: Two years ago, Sarah and her kids moved to another country, Jordan, because it was safer for them and because immigration officials told Sarah the visa process might go faster if she was outside Iraq. She moved, even though Jordan is expensive, and she couldn't work there legally, and she had no family nearby.
[1919.82 - 1944.72] NANCY UPDIKE: Finally, in November, 2016, two months ago-- eight years since her husband was killed and she very first started applying to come to the United States-- Sarah got a phone call from a US immigration official who, she says, told her her interview would happen in one hour. It wasn't enough time for Sarah to bring the lawyer she's entitled to, but she managed to get there in time with her kids, and they did the interview.
[1944.72 - 1948.65] NANCY UPDIKE: I called Sarah up in Jordan the day after the interview.
[1948.65 - 1951.61] NANCY UPDIKE: How are you doing?
[1951.61 - 1953.11] SARAH: [CHUCKLING]
[1953.11 - 1954.93] SARAH: nan
[1954.93 - 1967.60] SARAH: Look, Nancy, I really told the boys, you have to expect the worst. Maybe they will deny us.
[1967.60 - 1968.10] NANCY UPDIKE: Yeah.
[1968.10 - 2003.36] SARAH: Because I lost hope. To be honest, Nancy, I lost all the hope. I just felt that I am stuck in Jordan. But really I am not complaining from the way of my life. All of my complaining is for my boys and their future, growing up without any degree or any good education. I can say they are lost.
[2003.36 - 2028.52] NANCY UPDIKE: A month later, she got her answer. A few days before Christmas, I got an email from Sarah saying her application had been denied. The form letter from USCIS said her case was quote, "denied as a matter of discretion for security-related reasons." No specifics on the security-related reasons. She has 90 days to appeal, but the appeal has virtually no chance.
[2028.52 - 2046.97] NANCY UPDIKE: I'm not going to pretend I don't have an opinion here. Based on all the conversations I've had with US military personnel who worked with Sarah and know her, based on the time I spent working with her and the years I've known her, I think we failed Sarah. We, I mean the United States.
[2046.97 - 2080.99] NANCY UPDIKE: I think we failed her by letting this process drag on for so many years, some of them with Sarah and her kids living in limbo in Jordan. And I think after letting her case languish, we made the wrong call. My understanding is, in cases like Sarah's, anything that looks the slightest bit off outweighs everything else, even if it's from an anonymous tipster, even if American soldiers who worked with her never believed the accusations and, in fact, spent years trying to help her get to the United States.
[2080.99 - 2101.56] NANCY UPDIKE: Americans want to be safe. I want to be safe. But in my opinion, we aren't safer for keeping Sarah out, and we are abandoning a friend and an ally.
[2101.56 - 2121.11] IRA GLASS: Nancy Updike is one of the producers of our show. Coming up in the second half of the program, Nancy returns with the saga of how this special visa program for interpreters came to exist in the first place and why it's never worked that great. That's in a minute. It's from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.
