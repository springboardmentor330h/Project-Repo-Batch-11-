[0.35 - 16.89] IRA GLASS: You may remember this story that we did about a year ago, about canvassers going door to door and talking to voters for 20 minutes. And in just 20 minutes, the canvassers got some voters to change their minds, to flip positions on big, hot button issues. Gay marriage. Abortion.
[16.89 - 37.06] IRA GLASS: Which, of course, is amazing, right? That is not something that seems like it's even possible. There was a study in a well-known, peer reviewed journal-- Science magazine-- proving how remarkably effective these people were. They invented a whole new way to sway voter opinion. It seemed like a game changer, a whole new tool for politics, for liberals or conservatives to use.
[37.06 - 52.05] IRA GLASS: And then a month after our radio story-- maybe you saw this in the news-- there was overwhelming evidence that one of the researchers, a grad student named Michael LaCour had fabricated all the data. Science magazine retracted the article.
[52.05 - 60.82] IRA GLASS: But the team that invented this canvassing technique, they were not the ones that did the research study. That was a separate thing. And they were just as shocked as anybody. Maybe more shocked.
[60.82 - 72.62] IRA GLASS: The week the news broke, one of the canvass organizers, Steve DeLine, told me they'd spent months meticulously going door to door and keeping perfect records of everything they were doing for this researcher. To find out that LaCour had just made up his part of the data--
[72.62 - 91.35] STEVE DELINE: It's unfathomable to me, having you know, made sure that we were dotting every I and crossing every T. And you know, jumping through every hoop that he asked of us. It's just-- just can't really explain it. I'm at a loss.
[91.35 - 93.26] STEVE DELINE: nan
[93.26 - 98.60] IRA GLASS: Then in August, three months after the retraction, four months after our story aired--
[98.60 - 99.74] IRA GLASS: Hi.
[99.74 - 100.57] DAVE FLEISCHER: Hi.
[100.57 - 100.99] STEVE DELINE: Steve.
[100.99 - 101.47] DAVE FLEISCHER: Dave.
[101.47 - 101.87] IRA GLASS: Hi.
[101.87 - 102.27] IRA GLASS: nan
[102.27 - 102.86] STEVE DELINE: Nice to meet you.
[102.86 - 103.87] IRA GLASS: Nice to meet you guys in person.
[103.87 - 114.43] IRA GLASS: We got a visitor to our office from two of the guys who'd developed this canvassing technique, that guy Steve and his coworker Dave Fleischer. They happened to be in town from California. And they had news.
[114.43 - 119.18] IRA GLASS: A brand new study with new researchers was looking into their work. Results were coming in. Here's Dave.
[119.18 - 127.59] DAVE FLEISCHER: We're not anticipating going public with these results until January at the earliest, and maybe not till June.
[127.59 - 137.38] IRA GLASS: What these researchers really wanted to do was publish their results in Science magazine, you know, the place that published the original, discredited study. In fact, one of the researchers was laying the groundwork for that.
[137.38 - 156.68] DAVE FLEISCHER: So he actually called up Marcia McNutt, who's the editor of Science. And they didn't immediately reject it out of hand. She just said, "You know, the bar's going to be very high." [LAUGHS] Well, no [BEEP] fooling.
[156.68 - 163.99] IRA GLASS: Well, apparently Science magazine liked what the new researchers did. This week they published the new study about these canvassers.
[163.99 - 1822.70] IRA GLASS: This one's not fake. We know now, for real, whether those canvassers are, in fact, convincing anyone of anything when they go door to door. And if anything, what the canvassers are achieving and the way that they're achieving it is even more interesting than the fake study said.
[1822.70 - 1824.71] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass.
[1824.71 - 1830.84] IRA GLASS: Each week on our program of course, we choose some theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, "For your Reconsideration."
[1830.84 - 1840.79] IRA GLASS: We have stories today of people going back and rethinking evidence, reconsidering where they've been and what has come before. We have arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, "Hotline Bleak."
[1840.79 - 1853.94] IRA GLASS: So here's an example of a guy reconsidering his life in real time on the phone with a complete stranger. The recording comes from Chris Gethard, who's a comedian. He also does a cable TV show. He's been on our program now and then.
[1853.94 - 1863.36] IRA GLASS: And the recording that I want to play you comes from this new podcast that Chris is doing called Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People. Our editor Joel Lovell is the one who heard it and loved it.
[1863.36 - 1874.51] JOEL LOVELL: So the idea for the podcast is pretty simple. Chris is in a studio in New York, and he opens the phone line to one caller, an anonymous person calling in from anywhere for any reason at all.
[1874.51 - 1890.22] JOEL LOVELL: The only rules guiding the conversation are it's 60 minutes long and Chris can't hang up. If the caller decides to get off the line before the hour is up, if they get annoyed or mad or tired of Chris, that's totally fine. But Chris, he's in it for the duration.
[1890.22 - 1897.86] JOEL LOVELL: In this call you're about to hear, you can feel him at the beginning getting his bearings, so it's a little meandering. And then something changes.
[1897.86 - 1898.67] JOEL LOVELL: [BEEP]
[1898.67 - 1901.12] CHRIS GETHARD: Hey, this is Gethard. How are you?
[1901.12 - 1902.60] CALLER: Hey, what's up?
[1902.60 - 1903.53] CHRIS GETHARD: Eh, not much.
[1903.53 - 1906.61] CALLER: Just a second. I'm in a weird hallway right now. Am I echoey?
[1906.61 - 1908.41] CHRIS GETHARD: Ah, no. I think you're pretty good.
[1908.41 - 1909.37] CALLER: Awesome.
[1909.37 - 1911.27] CHRIS GETHARD: So what are we talking about?
[1911.27 - 1926.31] CALLER: I don't know. I'm at work. I just took about a 30-minute break in my car. I walked back in and then yeah, just nobody's here.
[1926.31 - 1927.68] CHRIS GETHARD: So you're just doing whatever you want.
[1927.68 - 1931.82] CALLER: I do customer service for accounts payable.
[1931.82 - 1934.15] CHRIS GETHARD: How is that? How do you like that?
[1934.15 - 1936.11] CALLER: Oh, it's the worst, Chris.
[1936.11 - 1942.70] CHRIS GETHARD: Yeah, it sounds like it. I didn't want to be judgmental, but it sounds awful. [LAUGHS] You're hiding in your car.
[1942.70 - 1959.77] CALLER: Yeah. It's been a year I've been doing this. I just feel like I've kind of wasted the last year. I feel like I spend a lot of time not doing things.
[1959.77 - 1964.22] CHRIS GETHARD: What are the things you're not doing?
[1964.22 - 1970.25] CALLER: I don't-- go to that-- take those improv classes.
[1970.25 - 1971.24] CHRIS GETHARD: Uh huh.
[1971.24 - 1975.14] CALLER: Go hang out.
[1975.14 - 1978.39] CHRIS GETHARD: But even when I say what are the things, you don't quite--
[1978.39 - 1979.32] CALLER: Yeah, I--
[1979.32 - 1981.26] CHRIS GETHARD: You don't really even know what the things are.
[1981.26 - 1985.08] CALLER: I feel I'm generally uncertain about everything.
[1985.08 - 1988.49] CHRIS GETHARD: You kind of have a dream to have some dreams.
[1988.49 - 1990.43] CALLER: Mhm.
[1990.43 - 1995.54] CHRIS GETHARD: Man, that's-- I don't want to be judgmental. I'm not trying to be judgmental. I say this with love. That's a--
[1995.54 - 1996.47] CALLER: No. I know.
[1996.47 - 1998.14] CHRIS GETHARD: That's a grim place to be.
[1998.14 - 2020.67] JOEL LOVELL: This kind of conversation with a sad person who has a vague wish to join an improv class or maybe go to an open mic night but probably won't, this is really familiar terrain for Chris. He hosts a show on cable and he often talks about his own mental health struggles. And he and his staff, they're always concocting ingenious ways to motivate and cheer up depressed people. Specifically, their own depressed fans.
[2020.67 - 2037.71] JOEL LOVELL: There's this one episode where Chris says, "OK, we're going to generate some footage here for people to revisit if they ever need to feel better." And then Ellie Kemper, that really sunny actress from The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt comes on. And they just keep bringing out impossibly cute things. There's a basket of bunnies.
[2037.71 - 2039.08] ELLIE KEMPER: "Oh bunnies!"
[2039.08 - 2040.46] CHRIS GETHARD: "Oh, look at these little baby bunnies!"
[2040.46 - 2047.25] JOEL LOVELL: And then a kitten. And then a baby dressed in a tuxedo. And she keeps having these huge spasms of joy.
[2047.25 - 2048.22] ELLIE KEMPER: "Oh!"
[2048.22 - 2049.19] ELLIE KEMPER: [APPLAUSE]
[2049.19 - 2057.56] JOEL LOVELL: All of which is to say this guy on the line saying he's not even sure what his dreams are, for Chris, that's like someone calling Suze Orman to talk about their FICO score.
[2057.56 - 2060.16] CHRIS GETHARD: So how do we work on this?
[2060.16 - 2074.95] CALLER: I don't know, Chris. I think I've probably been drinking too much, smoking too much weed. I need to be exercising. I should be meditating. I should be going to therapy.
[2074.95 - 2076.54] CHRIS GETHARD: Feels like this phone call--
[2076.54 - 2077.34] CALLER: Is this becoming therapy?
[2077.34 - 2083.05] CHRIS GETHARD: Well, it feels like this phone call is you taking one of the actions you say you don't usually take.
[2083.05 - 2084.00] CALLER: Mhm.
[2084.00 - 2090.85] CHRIS GETHARD: So I feel some responsibility to effect permanent change via this phone call.
[2090.85 - 2095.47] CALLER: Yeah. That'd be nice. I don't want to put that pressure on you.
[2095.47 - 2097.04] CHRIS GETHARD: No, I'll step up. I'll do my best.
[2097.04 - 2097.44] CALLER: Yeah.
[2097.44 - 2113.20] CHRIS GETHARD: What do I gotta do on this phone call? What do I gotta do in the next 49 minutes and 28 seconds? What do I gotta do to get you to never walk back into that office again? What do I gotta do to get you to get back in your car on this phone call and drive away from that office you hate while on this phone call?
[2113.20 - 2127.50] JOEL LOVELL: For the next 10 minutes or so, they talk exit strategies. Like "OK, let's start blue skying here. Do you have enough saved up to get out right now and buy yourself a little time to look for something better?" He's got $300 in the bank. So no, not even close.
[2127.50 - 2136.78] JOEL LOVELL: "All right, well, what else do you want to do?" No clear idea. His current plan is to get free by just being terrible at his job.
[2136.78 - 2142.52] CALLER: There was a point-- and it's still kind of ongoing since the summer-- of trying to get fired.
[2142.52 - 2144.44] CHRIS GETHARD: OK, so actively trying to get fired.
[2144.44 - 2145.13] CALLER: And it just doesn't happen.
[2145.13 - 2145.33] CALLER: nan
[2145.33 - 2145.77] CHRIS GETHARD: OK, so then--
[2145.77 - 2148.91] CALLER: Yeah. Actively shirking responsibility.
[2148.91 - 2150.41] CHRIS GETHARD: You found that, that you--
[2150.41 - 2152.18] CALLER: And that makes it--that feels worse.
[2152.18 - 2155.19] CHRIS GETHARD: [LAUGHS] It does. It feels worse. You don't feel like you're getting away with something.
[2155.19 - 2155.48] CALLER: It's like, oh--
[2155.48 - 2157.18] CHRIS GETHARD: You don't feel like you're sticking it to the man. You just--
[2157.18 - 2160.30] CALLER: Nothing. You're not holding me to a very high standard.
[2160.30 - 2166.33] CHRIS GETHARD: Can I ask how you got here? Where does it start? Not even thinking about the job. Where does it start?
[2166.33 - 2170.47] CHRIS GETHARD: Where do you come from? How do you grow up? And this is what you're telling me about.
[2170.47 - 2171.34] CALLER: Yeah. So where do you want me to start?
[2171.34 - 2175.57] CHRIS GETHARD: The beginning! We got 40 minutes. We got 39 minutes.
[2175.57 - 2177.22] CALLER: The beginning of my life?
[2177.22 - 2179.67] CHRIS GETHARD: Yes! I want to hear about the beginning of your life.
[2179.67 - 2188.26] CALLER: Yeah, I was born in Lake Jackson, Texas. The doctor that delivered me, I believe, was Ron Paul.
[2188.26 - 2190.07] CHRIS GETHARD: What?
[2190.07 - 2192.88] CALLER: Ron Paul? The Libertarian?
[2192.88 - 2194.74] CHRIS GETHARD: Yeah. Rand Paul's father, the--
[2194.74 - 2202.59] CALLER: Yeah, he was the OB/GYN and the Congressman in the district I'm from.
[2202.59 - 2212.65] CHRIS GETHARD: I ask you about the beginning of your life and the answer is that you were delivered into the world by rabble-rousing outsider politician Ron Paul.
[2212.65 - 2222.17] CALLER: I'll just add this to that day. When I was born, my mom had been in prison. And they let her out of prison to have me.
[2222.17 - 2228.02] CHRIS GETHARD: Wow! Can I ask what your mom was in prison for?
[2228.02 - 2233.34] CALLER: Mostly drugs and the types of things you do to get drugs.
[2233.34 - 2234.12] CHRIS GETHARD: Yeah.
[2234.12 - 2240.78] CALLER: I was raised by my grandparents. Now I didn't know who my dad was until I was 14.
[2240.78 - 2243.27] CHRIS GETHARD: 14. OK.
[2243.27 - 2256.90] CALLER: There was kind of a different guy I thought was my dad. Some balding, redheaded redneck. But my dad was the guy my mom was married to before that.
[2256.90 - 2258.29] CHRIS GETHARD: Uh-huh.
[2258.29 - 2268.90] CALLER: They got married in high school in Montana. Moved down to Texas, got divorced, then hooked up 10 years later at the fair.
[2268.90 - 2270.40] CHRIS GETHARD: At the fair.
[2270.40 - 2279.72] CALLER: Yeah, at the fair. And then that's where I came from. I was a carnival baby.
[2279.72 - 2285.60] CHRIS GETHARD: Hold on. You gotta give me permission to laugh at the phrase "carnival baby." 'Cause this is a very personal--
[2285.60 - 2286.58] CALLER: Oh yeah, of course.
[2286.58 - 2292.59] CHRIS GETHARD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much. This is a personal story and there's a lot of grim details to it. But you can't use the phrase--
[2292.59 - 2292.80] CALLER: Yeah.
[2292.80 - 2296.58] CHRIS GETHARD: "I was a carnival baby" and not expect me to laugh a little bit.
[2296.58 - 2297.35] CALLER: Yeah, no.
[2297.35 - 2316.04] CHRIS GETHARD: Now when you say they hooked up at the fair, do you mean they saw each other at the fair, remembered their old flame, went back to one or the other's house, and had a night of lovemaking to remember the old times? Or are you saying ran into each other at the fair and then behind the [BEEP] Gravitron, you get conceived?
[2316.04 - 2319.17] CALLER: I think it's more the latter.
[2319.17 - 2326.66] CHRIS GETHARD: 'Cause I don't want to be crass. I'm not trying to be insensitive. But you're telling me, your perception is you were conceived behind a corn dog stand?
[2326.66 - 2330.81] CALLER: Yeah. I imagined in the bathroom. But I don't know.
[2330.81 - 2337.59] CHRIS GETHARD: Man, you have had to think hard about the circumstances of your conception more than almost anybody I've ever met.
[2337.59 - 2339.52] CALLER: Yeah.
[2339.52 - 2352.99] JOEL LOVELL: I should say here that we tracked the caller down and talked to some of his relatives. And everything he says in this conversation-- being delivered by Ron Paul, his mom being in prison, his having been conceived at the fair-- it's all true.
[2352.99 - 2378.25] JOEL LOVELL: So Chris says, what's next? They're at 33 minutes and the clock's ticking and you can start to hear a little urgency in his voice. And the guy walks him through high school and college. And then after college, he moves into a trailer park. And a neighbor there tells him about a job opening at the place where he's calling from now, a company with the almost diabolically generic name Bank Tech, where he spends big swaths of his time hiding out in the hallway or eating yogurt out in his car.
[2378.25 - 2387.38] JOEL LOVELL: So there's that, I guess, the private yogurt time. But otherwise, it's soul death. Just slow, low wattage depression.
[2387.38 - 2397.18] JOEL LOVELL: There's about 10 minutes of that. And then Chris starts to press him. He actually really tries to change the guy's life in the brief time they have left.
[2397.18 - 2404.58] CHRIS GETHARD: What makes you happy on a daily basis? What are the moments that wake you up?
[2404.58 - 2423.63] CALLER: I don't know if I can confidently give you an answer on that. I don't know. I feel like lately it's been go to work, go home, internet, drink, smoke, sleep, repeat.
[2423.63 - 2429.19] CHRIS GETHARD: So we can call this one. Honestly, you're giving up a little bit huh?
[2429.19 - 2433.26] CALLER: No, I'm not giving up. Do you feel like I am? Am I shutting down?
[2433.26 - 2449.28] CHRIS GETHARD: I don't know. I mean, I don't know you at all beyond the past 43 minutes of our time together. But I'll say it sounds to me like you fought all the way through college. And then it sounds like after college, sounds like you stopped fighting.
[2449.28 - 2451.58] CALLER: That's accurate, I think.
[2451.58 - 2452.38] CHRIS GETHARD: Right?
[2452.38 - 2453.11] CALLER: Yeah.
[2453.11 - 2457.10] CHRIS GETHARD: What do I gotta do here? What do I gotta do? You tell me what I gotta do, 'cause I want to help.
[2457.10 - 2467.02] CHRIS GETHARD: And we got 13 minutes left. And then the phone gets hung up and I might never speak to you again in our whole lives. And this one I'm going to think about forever.
[2467.02 - 2469.60] CALLER: Do you have a pep talk? How do I start fighting?
[2469.60 - 2472.96] CHRIS GETHARD: I feel like this whole phone call's been the goddamn pep talk!
[2472.96 - 2476.82] CALLER: Yeah. I don't know if you can do more.
[2476.82 - 2491.17] CHRIS GETHARD: But I want to so bad. You should be going to see a band or a comedy show every night. You should be staying out late and talking to people every night, 'cause it sounds like you have a job where you could show up and literally go to sleep and no one would care.
[2491.17 - 2491.95] CALLER: Yeah.
[2491.95 - 2492.97] CHRIS GETHARD: Sounds like if you--
[2492.97 - 2493.89] CALLER: No one would-- or it wouldn't matter.
[2493.89 - 2512.40] CHRIS GETHARD: It sounds like if you got four hours of sleep every night 'cause you were out experiencing art and hanging out with people and doing crazy things and just living, you could come into Bank Tech, say hello, lay down under your desk, wake up eight hours later, and do it all again, and there would be no consequences.
[2512.40 - 2513.42] CALLER: Yeah.
[2513.42 - 2515.32] CHRIS GETHARD: Go out every night.
[2515.32 - 2518.96] CALLER: I haven't been-- I haven't been living.
[2518.96 - 2521.64] CHRIS GETHARD: You gotta live!
[2521.64 - 2525.34] CALLER: I feel like I get off work and I'm like, oh eight hours of sleep.
[2525.34 - 2526.16] CHRIS GETHARD: What is tonight?
[2526.16 - 2526.25] CALLER: Yeah.
[2526.25 - 2531.32] CHRIS GETHARD: Tonight's Monday? I'm just going to ask. My heart is bleeding a little bit. What city are you in?
[2531.32 - 2533.05] CALLER: I live in Denton. I work in Dallas.
[2533.05 - 2538.38] CHRIS GETHARD: You're in Denton? Denton has a huge music scene! Denton's like, an arts hub of Texas!
[2538.38 - 2539.15] CALLER: I know!
[2539.15 - 2541.38] CHRIS GETHARD: You're in the middle of it all! Go!
[2541.38 - 2549.13] CHRIS GETHARD: You go see the Marked Men! You go see the Mind Spiders! Even I know the bands that are in Denton, and I live in New York! You go! You live in Denton!
[2549.13 - 2549.28] CALLER: Yeah.
[2549.28 - 2555.13] CHRIS GETHARD: It's full of college people who are beautiful and young and making mistakes! You've got to just go!
[2555.13 - 2555.49] CALLER: I know.
[2555.49 - 2557.27] CHRIS GETHARD: There's stuff everywhere!
[2557.27 - 2559.10] CALLER: There's no excuse, is there?
[2559.10 - 2561.30] CHRIS GETHARD: I'm going to wonder forever if you did it!
[2561.30 - 2561.65] CALLER: I should've--
[2561.65 - 2567.56] CHRIS GETHARD: I'm going to wonder forever if you did it. We got seven minutes and I'm not convinced.
[2567.56 - 2570.11] CALLER: Oh. I don't know. I'm not convinced either.
[2570.11 - 2575.27] CHRIS GETHARD: No! That's not the answer I wanted! I wanted you to say, no this has effected permanent change!
[2575.27 - 2577.12] CALLER: I've seen enough of my patterns. You'll know!
[2577.12 - 2578.46] CHRIS GETHARD: Oh god!
[2578.46 - 2581.53] CALLER: I'll go do it and you'll know.
[2581.53 - 2583.05] CHRIS GETHARD: How will I know?
[2583.05 - 2584.00] CALLER: Oh, I just--
[2584.00 - 2588.41] CHRIS GETHARD: Are you inside? Are you still in that weird hallway?
[2588.41 - 2591.61] CALLER: No. I'm outside by a tree that I'm pacing around.
[2591.61 - 2597.87] CHRIS GETHARD: You're by a tree! I need you-- just start screaming. I need you to scream as loud as you can.
[2597.87 - 2600.80] CHRIS GETHARD: Break the pattern! Do a thing! That's the first--
[2600.80 - 2601.46] CALLER: [SCREAMS]
[2601.46 - 2602.30] CALLER: nan
[2602.30 - 2604.74] CHRIS GETHARD: More!
[2604.74 - 2605.62] CALLER: [SCREAMS]
[2605.62 - 2607.76] CHRIS GETHARD: [LAUGHS] More!
[2607.76 - 2608.65] CALLER: [SCREAMS]
[2608.65 - 2617.11] CHRIS GETHARD: That's a first step. That's what I got. That's the first step. You just started screaming in the middle of the day.
[2617.11 - 2618.14] CALLER: That's the first step?
[2618.14 - 2623.27] CHRIS GETHARD: I think so, man. Did it feel good to scream or just weird?
[2623.27 - 2627.11] CALLER: Yeah, no. It felt good. I'm a very loud person.
[2627.11 - 2630.17] CHRIS GETHARD: That's good. Great.
[2630.17 - 2633.05] CHRIS GETHARD: [BIRDS SINGING]
[2633.05 - 2635.45] CHRIS GETHARD: Are those birds? Do I hear birds back there?
[2635.45 - 2644.52] CALLER: Is that good? Yeah, there are birds around here. Someone pulled up right next to me, or I'd scream. Should I scream anyways?
[2644.52 - 2647.38] CHRIS GETHARD: You tell me if it would feel good. If it would feel good--
[2647.38 - 2657.25] CALLER: [SCREAMS] Yeah. I'm 10 minutes away from Dallas Comedy House.
[2657.25 - 2660.99] CHRIS GETHARD: You're killing me. Do they have open mics there?
[2660.99 - 2668.31] CALLER: Yeah. Open mics. I've known for months. Open Mics Tuesday. I've got something ready.
[2668.31 - 2670.89] CHRIS GETHARD: You've got an act? You've got an act you want to try?
[2670.89 - 2671.32] CALLER: Yeah.
[2671.32 - 2672.91] CHRIS GETHARD: You're doing it tomorrow.
[2672.91 - 2673.08] CALLER: Yeah.
[2673.08 - 2675.83] CHRIS GETHARD: You're doing it tomorrow. What time is the open mic?
[2675.83 - 2677.84] CALLER: I think it's at 7:00 or 8:00.
[2677.84 - 2679.21] CHRIS GETHARD: You're doing it tomorrow.
[2679.21 - 2679.81] CALLER: Yeah.
[2679.81 - 2685.68] CHRIS GETHARD: You're going to do it. And here's what's going to happen, is you're going to go and it's going to go terrible. It's your first open mic. It's going to go awful.
[2685.68 - 2691.01] CHRIS GETHARD: It's not going to be fun. You're not going to be funny and it's going to feel really uncomfortable. But you're gonna feel [BLEEP] alive, man.
[2691.01 - 2691.27] CALLER: Yeah.
[2691.27 - 2696.56] CHRIS GETHARD: You're going to feel alive. You promise me you do that open mic tomorrow? You promise me?
[2696.56 - 2698.10] CALLER: Yeah. I'll get it done.
[2698.10 - 2703.02] CHRIS GETHARD: OK, let's seal the promise. Do you know how we have to seal the promise?
[2703.02 - 2703.61] CALLER: How do we seal it?
[2703.61 - 2709.91] CHRIS GETHARD: Both at the same time. Ready? One, two, three. [SCREAMS]
[2709.91 - 2710.91] CALLER: [SCREAMS]
[2710.91 - 2713.12] CHRIS GETHARD: [SCREAMS]
[2713.12 - 2721.06] CHRIS GETHARD: nan
[2721.06 - 2725.34] JOEL LOVELL: That was it. He and Chris never talked again.
[2725.34 - 2738.91] JOEL LOVELL: So I asked the guy did he go to that open mic the next night? Nah, he didn't make it. Right after talking to Chris though, he set a date. March 21st. That's when he'd quit his job and start living.
[2738.91 - 2749.05] JOEL LOVELL: But then as the date got close, he told me he tried to do everything he could to undermine his own plan. He wasn't sure why, he just felt like he couldn't go through with it.
[2749.05 - 2777.05] JOEL LOVELL: And then that same week, this conversation went out on Chris's podcast. He had no idea they were going to run it. But he listened to it and he heard himself talk for an hour about all these things he wants to do but never does. And then he did it. He went in to Bank Tech and quit.
[2777.05 - 2811.34] IRA GLASS: Joel Lovell is the editor of our program. The podcast again is called Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People.
[2811.34 - 2823.89] IRA GLASS: Act Three, "Kids Look Back." So today we're hearing stories about people reconsidering and reexamining what happened to them in the past. And now with an entire book, I understand, of children doing this? Is that right, Brian?
[2823.89 - 2824.36] BRIAN REED: Yeah.
[2824.36 - 2826.82] IRA GLASS: I welcome into our studio our senior producer Brian Reed.
[2826.82 - 2827.96] BRIAN REED: Hi, hi.
[2827.96 - 2828.45] IRA GLASS: Hi.
[2828.45 - 2835.97] BRIAN REED: So I have this book here I'd like to share with you. I really enjoy it. It's called Now I Know Better: Kids Tell Kids About Safety.
[2835.97 - 2837.64] IRA GLASS: Now wait a second. You have it right there. You're handing me--
[2837.64 - 2838.28] BRIAN REED: Yeah. You want to take a look?
[2838.28 - 2839.23] IRA GLASS: Oh, this is a kind of a beat up--
[2839.23 - 2843.43] BRIAN REED: Oh, it's old school. Yeah, I had to find it used on Amazon. Not in circulation anymore. This is a rare copy.
[2843.43 - 2844.05] IRA GLASS: OK.
[2844.05 - 2853.63] BRIAN REED: So the premise of this is that it's kids telling other kids about safety. By telling war stories that they've been through, essentially. [LAUGHS]
[2853.63 - 2860.69] IRA GLASS: So is every story in this book a kid being like, oh I did this dumb ass thing, now I know better, don't do what I did?
[2860.69 - 2862.79] BRIAN REED: Yeah, precisely. Yeah, that's it.
[2862.79 - 2865.03] IRA GLASS: And how do you know about this?
[2865.03 - 2875.31] BRIAN REED: So my best friend, Christopher Alesevich, is a contributor, actually. He was 10 years old, I think, when he wrote this about an experience he had when he was five.
[2875.31 - 2876.93] IRA GLASS: So he did some dumb ass thing?
[2876.93 - 2886.29] BRIAN REED: Basically he was-- [LAUGHS] I guess he was playing in his yard on his swing set. And I remember this swing set. It was there when we were growing up. It's got a fort part to it.
[2886.29 - 2886.48] IRA GLASS: Mhm.
[2886.48 - 2888.91] BRIAN REED: This was slightly before I met him, I believe.
[2888.91 - 2889.33] IRA GLASS: Mhm.
[2889.33 - 2908.16] BRIAN REED: And he and his friend Michelle, for some reason they got it in their mind that it would be cool to make some kind of wall around this fort by wrapping string all the way around the fort many, many times. And at some point, they decided OK, it's time to cut the string off. So Michelle asked him to get some scissors.
[2908.16 - 2914.04] BRIAN REED: Christopher knew where the scissors were. They were in the drawer in the kitchen somewhere. So he ran inside, he got the scissors, he brought them out.
[2914.04 - 2917.09] IRA GLASS: Oh no. I feel-- now that scissors have entered the scene, now I feel worried.
[2917.09 - 2919.50] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS] Yes. And you should.
[2919.50 - 2935.24] BRIAN REED: So then Michelle began cutting some of the string. And Christopher, to hear him tell it, basically wanted to get a closer look. And she cut towards his eye, and the scissors went into his left eye.
[2935.24 - 2936.61] IRA GLASS: [WHISPERS] Oh my god!
[2936.61 - 2938.28] BRIAN REED: Just right in there.
[2938.28 - 2939.62] IRA GLASS: Poor kid.
[2939.62 - 2952.72] BRIAN REED: He says he actually didn't really feel pain, amazingly. But he did know something was wrong. There was fluid coming down out of his eye. Anyway, he needed very serious eye surgery. He was in the hospital for days.
[2952.72 - 2975.21] BRIAN REED: So the thing about his story and about so many of these stories that I really love is one, the tone of them. [LAUGHS] They were written-- just imagine a five-year-old or an eight-year-old writing a war story. Just kind of telling it. Like, imagine them sitting in a bar like sidled up with like whiskey and they're a 10-year-old talking about the time they had scissors shoved into their eye.
[2975.21 - 2982.43] IRA GLASS: So it's not just kids looking back. It's kids looking back with an unnatural seriousness that's being pressed on them by the adults who are writing the book?
[2982.43 - 2984.41] BRIAN REED: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, that's what's happening.
[2984.41 - 2990.21] IRA GLASS: Let's hear what it sounds like. Here, read what your friend writes. And read it kind of like a grizzled war vet.
[2990.21 - 3009.65] BRIAN REED: OK. (GRAVELY) "The scissors jerked back and poked me right in the eye. I don't remember much of what followed, except that my mom and dad took me to St. Vincent Hospital where Dr. Mark Steckel did surgery on my eye. I learned not to put my eyes near any sharp objects. And I would advise you to do the same."
[3009.65 - 3010.54] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS]
[3010.54 - 3014.47] BRIAN REED: "Christopher Alesevich, age 10."
[3014.47 - 3030.22] BRIAN REED: So the other thing that I wanted to share with you that I find entertaining about these is the advice and the lesson of so many of these is so specific that I find it incredibly, incredibly humorous, OK. [LAUGHS]
[3030.22 - 3041.53] BRIAN REED: And even when I remember talking to Chris about it, the lesson of this story was don't lean into scissors that are cutting a particularly taut piece of string because you could get poked in the eye.
[3041.53 - 3041.79] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS]
[3041.79 - 3044.83] BRIAN REED: That's what he took away from the story. [LAUGHS]
[3044.83 - 3045.89] IRA GLASS: And so they're all like that?
[3045.89 - 3047.87] BRIAN REED: A lot of them are. Can I read you this one?
[3047.87 - 3049.56] IRA GLASS: Sure.
[3049.56 - 3057.07] BRIAN REED: So this one is in the chapter called-- the chapters are amazing, by the way. There's many, many chapters.
[3057.07 - 3059.29] IRA GLASS: Amazing like what? Like what are the different chapters? What are they--
[3059.29 - 3071.72] BRIAN REED: There's just such a variety. It makes you realize how dangerous of a place the world is. You've got axes, bees, bicycles, burns, camping, cars, cuts, dogs, doors, drinking, electricity, escalator.
[3071.72 - 3073.84] IRA GLASS: That is a lot of dangerous things.
[3073.84 - 3078.93] BRIAN REED: All right, this one's my favorite. You want to guess what the name of this chapter is?
[3078.93 - 3080.13] IRA GLASS: Poison?
[3080.13 - 3082.14] BRIAN REED: No.
[3082.14 - 3089.28] IRA GLASS: Wait, hold on. Not staying far enough from the edge of a cliff?
[3089.28 - 3090.22] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS]
[3090.22 - 3091.36] IRA GLASS: Is that a chapter?
[3091.36 - 3097.03] BRIAN REED: No, sadly. This chapter's called "Nose." Simply.
[3097.03 - 3098.38] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS]
[3098.38 - 3100.19] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS]
[3100.19 - 3101.49] IRA GLASS: Just straight up "Nose."
[3101.49 - 3103.95] BRIAN REED: "Nose." [LAUGHS] As in N-O-S-E.
[3103.95 - 3106.96] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS] I got it.
[3106.96 - 3111.25] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS] All right. The title of this one is "No One is Laughing."
[3111.25 - 3113.17] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS]
[3113.17 - 3117.49] BRIAN REED: Dude! [LAUGHS]
[3117.49 - 3118.93] BRIAN REED: nan
[3118.93 - 3129.45] BRIAN REED: [SIGHS] So this one's written by a 12-year-old named Dan Strang. It's actually written in the third person-- which is interesting, it's an interesting take about another child.
[3129.45 - 3144.53] BRIAN REED: "When Karen was three, she was just trying to show off for two other cousins when they were watching TV. She took the leftover kernels from the bottom of the bowl of popcorn and stuck two kernels up her small nostrils. She kept them up there for about a minute and got a couple laughs.
[3144.53 - 3166.47] BRIAN REED: Then she tried to take them out. She tried so hard her nostrils were as red as blood. In the emergency room, they had no idea how she got them in there. The doctors decided to stick the tweezers up her nose while she was pushing with her index fingers from the top to bottom. Finally, the kernels popped out. I dearly suggest that you never stick popcorn kernels up your nose to be funny, because it's a serious accident."
[3166.47 - 3167.35] IRA GLASS: [LAUGHS]
[3167.35 - 3169.12] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS]
[3169.12 - 3171.77] IRA GLASS: So what do you like about that one so much?
[3171.77 - 3186.25] BRIAN REED: Again, I just love the specificity of it. Like, if I were to go through that or witness it as an adult, if I were to try and tell someone to watch out, I'd been there, you don't want to go through what I went through, I might say, don't stick foreign objects up your nose of any kind.
[3186.25 - 3187.67] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[3187.67 - 3195.79] BRIAN REED: But the lesson that this 12-year-old draws is don't stick popcorn kernels up your nose to be funny.
[3195.79 - 3199.35] IRA GLASS: OK. So kids do not generalize. That is what I've learned from this so far.
[3199.35 - 3211.68] BRIAN REED: Yeah, apparently not. And actually, I talked to my friend Christopher about what happened to him. And we were reading through the book together. And his mom actually happened to be there too, 'cause she was visiting him. And she was a first grade teacher for many, many years before she retired.
[3211.68 - 3212.02] IRA GLASS: Oh.
[3212.02 - 3215.65] BRIAN REED: And she totally confirmed this. She was like, yeah. This is something I dealt with day in, day out.
[3215.65 - 3227.87] BRIAN REED: And actually, they told me a story that I did not know in all the years I've known him that illustrates this perfectly. There is apparently a sequel to the earlier scissors story.
[3227.87 - 3237.99] CHRIS'S MOTHER: Brian, as his mother, I'd like to interject that he's learned not to put his eyes near sharp things. But he never learned not to put his fingers near sharp things. [LAUGHS]
[3237.99 - 3248.75] BRIAN REED: So I guess two years after he got hospitalized for scissors, he was at school. The school day was ending. He was waiting for the bus with kids in his class.
[3248.75 - 3263.91] BRIAN REED: And somehow he and this girl were playing, and there was a pair of scissors around. He was very insistent that they were safety scissors, like the kind of plasticky, rounded-edge ones or whatever.
[3263.91 - 3264.97] IRA GLASS: Right. Sure.
[3264.97 - 3269.94] BRIAN REED: And somehow they were playing with these. And the question of are these dangerous or not came up.
[3269.94 - 3284.84] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: I looked at these special scissors, and they were very dull. They had rounded tips, and so they were not sharp, as where my previous lesson was that sharp scissors are dangerous. And so therefore, not-sharp scissors are not dangerous.
[3284.84 - 3285.68] BRIAN REED: How old were you?
[3285.68 - 3287.77] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: So this was second grade. I must have been--
[3287.77 - 3290.45] CHRIS'S MOTHER: You were probably seven. But you're a January birthday, so--
[3290.45 - 3305.57] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: So not only was I so sure that scissors that didn't look sharp were not dangerous, but then I had to prove to another person my knowledge of this matter and to show off that hey, you're wrong. These scissors are not dangerous.
[3305.57 - 3322.30] BRIAN REED: It's amazing that the very serious lesson you'd been taught by being hospitalized a couple years earlier, the lesson you'd been taught to specifically watch yourself around scissors was the thing that inspired you to be extra braggadocious--
[3322.30 - 3323.02] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: Confident. That's right.
[3323.02 - 3324.49] BRIAN REED: --and careless around scissors.
[3324.49 - 3325.92] CHRIS'S MOTHER: Yes. Yes.
[3325.92 - 3332.28] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: So what I did, I stuck out my hand and my finger, and I was like, here cut. It's not going to cut.
[3332.28 - 3333.13] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS] God.
[3333.13 - 3337.65] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: Lo and behold, it cut my finger. I was like, "oh, crap!"
[3337.65 - 3338.14] CHRIS'S MOTHER: [LAUGHS]
[3338.14 - 3339.11] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: [LAUGHS]
[3339.11 - 3350.91] BRIAN REED: So I guess his parents had to get called by the principal. He couldn't go home on the bus 'cause he was bleeding quite profusely. Again, his parents had to be told, "Christopher has had an incident with scissors." [LAUGHS]
[3350.91 - 3354.22] BRIAN REED: He was fine. But you know.
[3354.22 - 3358.09] BRIAN REED: So what was the lesson of that accident?
[3358.09 - 3364.75] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: So the lesson of that accident is that all scissors are sharp, regardless of whether they look sharp or not.
[3364.75 - 3365.59] BRIAN REED: [LAUGHS]
[3365.59 - 3372.44] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: And actually I did internalize that lesson. And I'd like to point out, there has not been a third scissors incident.
[3372.44 - 3374.58] BRIAN REED: And a good 25 years have gone by.
[3374.58 - 3375.02] CHRIS'S MOTHER: Mhm.
[3375.02 - 3380.75] CHRISTOPHER ALESEVICH: Yeah. Lesson learned there.
[3380.75 - 3382.58] IRA GLASS: Brian Reed, thank you very much.
