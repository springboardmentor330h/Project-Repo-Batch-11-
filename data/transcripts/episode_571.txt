[0.95 - 4.54] IRA GLASS: Do you know where you're going to do this? Do you know where you're going to ask the question?
[4.54 - 7.19] MAN: Yeah. Yeah, I know where and when.
[7.19 - 7.30] MAN: nan
[7.30 - 9.72] IRA GLASS: Where is it going to be? What can you say about that?
[9.72 - 12.51] MAN: At her home, next week.
[12.51 - 12.71] MAN: nan
[12.71 - 18.72] IRA GLASS: Some answer. You're going in a week. Oh my God. So are you freaking out?
[18.72 - 20.64] MAN: I'm a little excited.
[20.64 - 50.04] IRA GLASS: This man is 76. I'm not going to say his name here on the radio, because he's hoping that the woman that he wants to marry is not going to get tipped off by some radio or podcast listener that he's about to ask her. And he doesn't know what she's going to say. He doesn't know. Which is not usually how that goes down, right? Usually, you ask somebody to marry you, you kind of know. He's totally shooting in the dark, anxious about what she's going to say. And this is somebody who he's had feelings about for a long time.
[50.04 - 59.19] MAN: I met this girl at a time when I was 17, she was 16. She was very popular. She was one of, you might say, the queens in high school, right?
[59.19 - 61.14] IRA GLASS: But nice, he says, really nice.
[61.14 - 77.96] MAN: And I didn't have all the confidence and courage that I needed at the time. And I just felt like I don't I don't measure up. I mean, she can pick any superstar or whatever. I was a fairly good athlete, but I wasn't a superstar and whatever and stuff like that.
[77.96 - 80.53] IRA GLASS: All right. So you didn't do everything you could.
[80.53 - 94.08] MAN: No, I didn't try. I just played like, well, hey, we're just friends. And then, when it was time to go to the Navy, I just left, took the coward's way out.
[94.08 - 120.46] IRA GLASS: But that experience changed him, he says. When he met his wife, he totally went for it. Didn't want to make the same mistake again. He and his wife were together for nearly 47 years, had children, who are now grown. And when his wife died eight years ago, after some time passed, he checked in with this woman from high school. Well, her husband had died. And so this man started flying to the other side of the country to visit her, where she lives now. He stays in the guest room at her house.
[120.46 - 144.74] MAN: So the visits there, I would visit her for a week or so, and we hung out everyday, and we just did natural things. And we just went places and what have you. But there was really no intimacy involved, realistically. We were just hanging out, and I believe she was having a good time. I was having a good time. You know?
[144.74 - 148.14] IRA GLASS: But you guys didn't kiss?
[148.14 - 164.62] MAN: Well, maybe only once or twice over those years and what have you. And every time we met, it was a friendly kiss on the side of the face, but it wasn't anything like a passionate, real kiss. And that happened only once, along the way, once or twice along the way.
[164.62 - 173.67] IRA GLASS: Now, you must have been testing the waters and saying things to figure out where she felt and what her feelings were, right?
[173.67 - 183.89] MAN: I was trying very hard to find that out along the way, Ira. And I was getting some mixed signals. I didn't-- I had a sense on the one hand, when it was all over--
[183.89 - 202.11] IRA GLASS: OK, those mixed signals, she'd hold his hand all the time. She never hesitated when he would call her and ask to schedule another week-long visit. But at the same time, she seemed very encouraging about him going out with other people, like weirdly encouraging. And she did not seem interested in discussing her feelings towards him.
[202.11 - 214.89] MAN: It seemed like any time a question or anything came up that related towards that or went in that direction, she tended to slide away from it a little bit.
[214.89 - 217.53] IRA GLASS: That does not sound good to me.
[217.53 - 228.48] MAN: That didn't sound good to me either. My feeling was that she didn't want you to ask this question. She doesn't want to have to give you that answer.
[228.48 - 230.58] IRA GLASS: Did you tell her you love her?
[230.58 - 231.90] MAN: Yes, I did.
[231.90 - 234.48] IRA GLASS: Has she ever said I love you back?
[234.48 - 237.09] MAN: No, no.
[237.09 - 240.84] IRA GLASS: Well, is it possible she just wants to be friends?
[240.84 - 242.87] MAN: Very good possibility.
[242.87 - 276.60] IRA GLASS: OK, ladies and gentlemen, I know what you're thinking. This does not sound promising at all. And, oh my God, what love struck creatures we all are, wandering around this earth, right? Here is a 76-year-old man, a father, a grandfather with the same logic defying feelings dominating him that a teenager has. He told me that back in July after years of wondering with this woman, OK, are we always just going to be friends? Is this ever going to be more than that, he finally told her, OK, look, we're going on a date. We're going on a date. It's going to be a real date. Are you up to have a real date with me? And she said yes.
[276.60 - 278.04] IRA GLASS: So how'd that go?
[278.04 - 285.22] MAN: It went well, but it didn't go any differently than all the other dates we went on.
[285.22 - 287.94] IRA GLASS: So nothing really changed?
[287.94 - 313.75] MAN: No. So realistically, if I want to be just honest with you and-- I don't know where this can go, what have you, but my feeling is that either she truly wants me to move on, or she's waiting for me to ask this question. Will you marry me? That's really where I am. And I don't know which one is true.
[313.75 - 323.62] IRA GLASS: But you know people, if somebody is interested, they let you know. If a lady is interested, she figures out a way to let you know, right?
[323.62 - 332.20] MAN: Yeah. Some people might say, well, hey, she lets you stay at her house. I mean, you stay there all week.
[332.20 - 337.24] IRA GLASS: Oh man, you are stuck on this lady. Oh my god.
[337.24 - 338.66] IRA GLASS: [CHUCKLING]
[338.66 - 339.38] IRA GLASS: nan
[339.38 - 362.42] MAN: Well, let's put it this way. That may be the case, but it doesn't change anything that I just want to know that, hey, I did everything I could. And that's what I didn't do first time. That's what I didn't do the first time.
[362.42 - 368.94] IRA GLASS: You know, what strikes me is that this is just very inconvenient for you, that you like her so much.
[368.94 - 371.69] MAN: That I like her so much? That that's inconvenient?
[371.69 - 387.00] IRA GLASS: Yeah, yeah, that you're having these feelings, that you're stuck on this lady, it seems like you're in the grip of this thing. You don't even have a choice. It defies all good sense. You know all the signs pointing against it. And yet-- and yet you feel like you have no choice. You have to ask this question.
[387.00 - 415.15] MAN: Oh, I do have to. In truth, I understand that. I do have to ask the question. My heart says resolve it. You know, just resolve it. And if her heart doesn't want it, then I don't want it with her. You know?
[415.15 - 437.60] IRA GLASS: Honestly, over the course of this conversation, I went from thinking that it was a terrible idea for him to ask this woman to marry him next week, to thinking he should totally do it. He totally convinced me that he needed to hear yes or no once and for all. And maybe he was going to get what he wanted, or maybe he was going to be set free, but either one of those was going to be better than just floating around her like he's been, wanting this thing to happen.
[437.60 - 458.68] IRA GLASS: And then, OK, we talked the next day on the phone. And I learned that a weird thing happened in that conversation that he and I had had the day before, which is we switched positions. He had completely convinced me that he should ask her, but I had completely convinced him that he should not, because she wasn't showing enough signs that she loves him, because it seemed doomed on its face.
[458.68 - 474.31] IRA GLASS: So the next day, Tuesday, this week, we got on the phone and he told me his new very pragmatic, very sober plan. He's not going to ask her to marry him next week. He's just going to tell her his feelings, and see if she's open to being in a real, actual, committed relationship.
[474.31 - 487.73] MAN: This opens the door to get started with a relationship. I'm not really saying that she would want to go there, but if she does, then the question would be, well, where do we go from there?
[487.73 - 511.58] IRA GLASS: So he flies to his fate this weekend. He's asking her Wednesday, he thinks. "The heart wants what it wants." Emily Dickinson wrote that. Though depending on how old you are, you might associate it with Woody Allen or Selena Gomez. Today on our program, people who get stuck on somebody, whether that's a good idea or not, whether they want to or not, people who get stuck, even when the signs are not looking so very good for them at all.
[511.58 - 2449.82] IRA GLASS: From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.
[2449.82 - 2468.92] IRA GLASS: It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, The Heart Wants What It Wants. What happens when you find that whether you like it or not, you're having feelings, big feelings for somebody who is giving you signs that it really might not work out? We first broadcast this show a year ago. We have arrived at Act 2 of our program, Act 2, My Love is Blue.
[2468.92 - 2497.56] IRA GLASS: Elsa Waithe is a stand up comedian, young, moved to New York City not that long ago. Two years ago, after the policeman who shot Michael Brown was not indicted for killing him, she felt like, OK, that is not right. And she decided to join the protesters who were out demonstrating about the decision and about police behavior. And at her very first protest, this thing happened she did not expect. She got a very inconvenient crush on somebody she had no desire to have a crush on. And of course, as we have heard this hour, that is something you cannot control.
[2497.56 - 2526.53] IRA GLASS: She talked about this on stage in a storytelling show about crushes. We have a recording from that show that is a little janky but it is totally audible with, as you will hear, a very enthusiastic audience. If you're listening online or to the podcast of our program, I want to say before we start, we have unbeeped a few curse words here in this online version of the program. If you prefer the beeped version of our show, maybe you're listening with little kids, you can get that it's thisamericanlife.org. Anyway, here's Elsa.
[2526.53 - 2556.60] ELSA WAITHE: And so now once we get to Times Square, we've met up with other groups. And at this point, it's massive. So we spread across the intersection, and we all sit down. And sure enough, the riot cops step up. And the riot police all have the face masks, the face guards. And a part of me is thinking this is very intimidating. And you can't see anybody's face. And they're really big, and it's just one stormtrooper sort of thing of very scary police officers.
[2556.60 - 2575.05] ELSA WAITHE: And at this point, you guys, I'm really nervous. I'm really scared because they've given a dispersal warning and people are getting flustered and people are starting to leave. And those of us who are sitting down, it's dwindled. There's also lots of cameras here, so I've made my stand. I don't want to get up, OK?
[2575.05 - 2576.86] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2576.86 - 2608.35] ELSA WAITHE: People are going to see that. And I'm just trying to find a zen place. I'm just trying to look around and just find something to focus on, and really all I'm seeing is my reflection in all of these face masks, until I get to one officer, who has not put her face mask down, you guys. And it was just the most angelic face.
[2608.35 - 2610.85] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2610.85 - 2615.19] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2615.19 - 2646.23] ELSA WAITHE: It was very delicate inside of this. And it almost didn't seem like she even wanted to be there. I was transfixed. And the sergeant, he says line up. And I realize that they're lining up in front of who they are going to arrest, and she's lined up with me.
[2646.23 - 2648.67] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2648.67 - 2654.55] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2654.55 - 2668.67] ELSA WAITHE: And he gives one more dispersal warning. He says you have 30 seconds to get out of the street. You were obstructing traffic. If you do not get out of the street, you are subject to arrest. And I says, well, her?
[2668.67 - 2671.11] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2671.11 - 2674.52] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2674.52 - 2707.78] ELSA WAITHE: The Sergeant gets one the megaphone and he says, OK, that's it. Whoever's here, round them up. And so she leans in and she says, you're going to have to come with me. And I realize I'm being filmed. There's lots of cameras. Flashbulbs are going off everywhere. And so I wanted to be really thug and gangster about it, you know what I'm saying? You know? I was like, in my mind, I said, "Yeah, you're going have to pick me up!" But I think what actually came out and was like, "Yeah, OK."
[2707.78 - 2710.21] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2710.21 - 2716.03] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2716.03 - 2734.14] ELSA WAITHE: She picks me up, and she turns me around. And she goes to put the zip ties, the flex cuffs on me. And it was really-- she put them on really tight, you guys. And I wanted to be upset, but I kind of liked it. I don't know.
[2734.14 - 2736.51] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2736.51 - 2740.32] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2740.32 - 2768.55] ELSA WAITHE: And here's the thing, you guys. I was part of the first 10 people to be arrested in New York City in conjunction with these non-indictments. They were calling us the Times Square 10. My picture was everywhere. In the morning, when I woke up, it was on CNN. It was on Yahoo News. And so all my friends back home, they've seen these pictures, and everyone's like, wow, you look really calm amongst all this chaos and--
[2768.55 - 2769.89] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2769.89 - 2772.05] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2772.05 - 2773.85] ELSA WAITHE: What was going through your mind?
[2773.85 - 2776.17] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2776.17 - 2780.65] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2780.65 - 2801.29] ELSA WAITHE: I wanted to tell people something really poignant, you know? I was thinking about civil rights and I was thinking about Dr. King. And I wanted to tell you that it was all those things. But really it was just like, "Holy shit, there's a lot of cameras! Her hands are soft."
[2801.29 - 2803.70] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2803.70 - 2831.47] ELSA WAITHE: Gosh. So they load us into the back of the paddy-wagon. Unfortunately, she does not ride with us. But when we get to the precinct now, I'm reunited with my arresting officer, because they have to take you through the booking process, OK? And so then they take your mugshot. Now, I'm ready for this. All the excitement from getting arrested has dissipated. Here's the real shit. I'm getting processed now, but you're partnered up with who arrested you.
[2831.47 - 2848.27] ELSA WAITHE: So I get her name now. This is Officer Laura. All right. So now I have her name and this is great. So she's taking me through the fingerprinting process, and they have to take your hand. They do it for you. They take your hand. And she's holding my hand.
[2848.27 - 2850.54] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2850.54 - 2852.83] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2852.83 - 2867.10] ELSA WAITHE: And pressing my fingers into the ink, and now we're making a finger picture and it's gorgeous. This is our first piece of artwork together!
[2867.10 - 2869.56] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2869.56 - 2874.97] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2874.97 - 2903.76] ELSA WAITHE: And now it was mugshot time, you guys. It was time for the mugshot. And I am determined. I am going to take a gangster mugshot, OK? I know nothing about this says gangster, but I'm going to thug up and take this mugshot, right? So we take it from the front. Boom. Take it from the side, boom. And then, you guys, surprise, surprise, your arresting officer gets in the picture with you!
[2903.76 - 2906.23] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2906.23 - 2910.17] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2910.17 - 2927.43] ELSA WAITHE: And we get to take a picture together! I was so excited! I was so strong in the first two pictures, and then she gets in for the third, and I was so amped I threw a thumb up.
[2927.43 - 2929.89] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[2929.89 - 2931.82] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[2931.82 - 2967.91] ELSA WAITHE: She didn't find that amusing. She slapped my hand. She's like, no gang signs! Can I get a copy of this for Facebook? No one's going to believe me! All right, so that's where all the fun stopped, you guys. They put me in the cell. I was in for 8 and 1/2 hours. But I left in the morning. I wasn't tired. I wasn't upset. I just had butterflies, cherubs, rainbows, unicorns. I wonder if I'll ever see her again. You know?
[2967.91 - 2996.54] ELSA WAITHE: But I finally got the gumption to go back out. I'm not going to let this silence me. I'm not going to let this scare me. And I had some down time. I'm going to go back out. And so I went back out, no friends, nobody to tell anybody I was back out. Went back to Times Square and I was out there taking laps around Times Square with signs, waiting for the crowd to get bigger. And you guys, I see what appears to be Officer Laura.
[2996.54 - 3014.84] ELSA WAITHE: And you've got to understand, I'm with some really anti-police people. So you really can't say shit to the cops, right? But I got [INAUDIBLE]. And I was like, "Officer Laura." And she turned around and it was her. And I couldn't contain my excitement. I was like, "Oh my God, it's so good to see you!"
[3014.84 - 3017.28] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[3017.28 - 3025.69] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[3025.69 - 3027.16] ELSA WAITHE: And I gave her a hug.
[3027.16 - 3029.12] ELSA WAITHE: [LAUGHTER]
[3029.12 - 3042.26] ELSA WAITHE: Which didn't win me points from anybody. Because the protesters weren't happy and neither were the police. And Officer Laura didn't remember me, you guys.
[3042.26 - 3044.74] ELSA WAITHE: [MOANING]
[3044.74 - 3045.73] ELSA WAITHE: nan
[3045.73 - 3049.87] ELSA WAITHE: So fuck the police. All right.
[3049.87 - 3064.68] IRA GLASS: Elsa Waithe, she hosts a monthly comedy night in New York called Affirmative Laughter. On Twitter, she is elsajustelsa. She has recorded a monthly storytelling event called Tell at the Bureau of General Service Queer Division on 13th Street.
[3064.68 - 3073.17] IRA GLASS: Act 3, Unbreak My Heart. So this last story starts in exactly the way you would expect if you were even half paying attention to today's program.
[3073.17 - 3076.74] JULIA LILLIS: I definitely 100% thought he was the one.
[3076.74 - 3090.81] IRA GLASS: That's Julia. A few years back, when she was in her 20s, she dated this guy who lived in England. She was in Los Angeles. She loved thinking about marrying him and moving to England and raising little babies with British accents who'd call her mummy. And then one day, she was at work.
[3090.81 - 3098.28] JULIA LILLIS: And we were on Skype. Not the video Skype, but the chat Skype, just typing to each other, like instant messenger.
[3098.28 - 3102.99] IRA GLASS: And he dumped her, not even on video. He text dumped her.
[3102.99 - 3120.00] JULIA LILLIS: And it really took me by surprise. He wrote, "This isn't working for me." And I thought he meant his computer or something. I had no idea he was talking about our entire relationship.
[3120.00 - 3123.90] IRA GLASS: Well, the wording leaves it vague, to be fair. The wording is very vague.
[3123.90 - 3131.21] JULIA LILLIS: Yeah, I agree.
[3131.21 - 3139.59] IRA GLASS: She couldn't concentrate on work anymore. Her life was wrecked. No more babies calling her mummy in the future. And as she drove home, sitting in traffic--
[3139.59 - 3147.33] JULIA LILLIS: I called 1-800-Expedia, and I bought a one way ticket to England that left in six hours.
[3147.33 - 3149.79] IRA GLASS: Maybe you should explain your thinking here.
[3149.79 - 3183.48] JULIA LILLIS: I really thought, OK I'm going to make this big grand gesture. I'm a big rom com fan. And I felt like this was my rom com moment in life. What would Bridget Jones do? You know what she would do? She would go to England right away. So that was the plan. I thought I'd show up at his house. It would be a surprise. And he'll see me and our eyes will lock. And if he sees me, he'll remember that we're perfect for each other and we should get married.
[3183.48 - 3194.63] IRA GLASS: So packs a bag. Overpacks, actually, because who knows how long she'll be staying. Maybe the rest of her life? Lands in England, gets off the plane, then it hits her.
[3194.63 - 3207.27] JULIA LILLIS: As I'm in the customs line, I start like crying and a little bit freaking out, what am I doing? And I think that was the first time I started thinking, what if it doesn't go as they think that it'll go? You know?
[3207.27 - 3208.44] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[3208.44 - 3212.85] JULIA LILLIS: When he sees me, he won't say you're the one.
[3212.85 - 3213.69] IRA GLASS: Yeah.
[3213.69 - 3225.62] JULIA LILLIS: So I started crying. And I approach-- I get to the front and I approached this customs agent, who was this adorable little British guy. He was maybe 20.
[3225.62 - 3239.91] IRA GLASS: He asks her, how long are you going to be in the country? Standard question. But this sets off a huge cry, because of course that is the biggest question in her whole life at this moment. The answer depends entirely on the boyfriend. She spills the whole story to the British customs agent.
[3239.91 - 3255.49] JULIA LILLIS: The whole story, the whole plan. My boyfriend dumped me on Skype yesterday. I bought a one way ticket to England. I'm going to surprise him. And I told him, you know, but he's the one. He just forgets I'm the one. And I looked at him. I'm like, "Is that crazy?"
[3255.49 - 3265.67] JULIA LILLIS: And I swear to you, Ira, he looked me straight in the eye, and with this adorable little British accent, he says, "You got to do what you got to do for love."
[3265.67 - 3267.96] JULIA LILLIS: [CHUCKLING]
[3267.96 - 3269.33] JULIA LILLIS: nan
[3269.33 - 3288.90] JULIA LILLIS: Which I thought was like, "Yeah, he's right!" I mean, come on. That's straight out of a romantic comedy, right? And I really thought at that moment, I am doing what I got to do for love. That's what I'm doing right now!
[3288.90 - 3298.35] IRA GLASS: She did not end up with the guy. When he sees her, he does not propose. He doesn't know. You are not the one. She flies home the next morning.
[3298.35 - 3305.49] IRA GLASS: Can I ask you when you look back on this, the thing that the British customs agents said to you, what was the line again?
[3305.49 - 3310.11] JULIA LILLIS: He said, "You got to do what you got to do for love."
[3310.11 - 3315.15] IRA GLASS: Do you think he's right, in retrospect?
[3315.15 - 3327.81] JULIA LILLIS: I think, yeah. You know, I think he's right. And I'm glad I did what I thought I had to do for love. Because it really put the nail in the coffin on that relationship.
[3327.81 - 3337.12] IRA GLASS: Wait, you think you did the right thing even though you also think, with the distance of years, that it was crazy?
[3337.12 - 3346.77] JULIA LILLIS: It was crazy. Don't get me wrong. But if I hadn't done all of this, I don't know. It would feel a little open ended.
[3346.77 - 3371.01] IRA GLASS: It's so interesting that this is what you're saying to me. Because we began this week's show with a 76-year-old man who on Sunday is flying across the country to tell this woman that he has feelings for her, and to see if she has feelings for him. And he knows, I think, in the back of his mind, that it's probably doomed, and he can't stop himself.
[3371.01 - 3376.23] JULIA LILLIS: Well, he's got to do it, though, right? He's got to do what he's got to do for love, Ira.
[3376.23 - 3382.77] IRA GLASS: No, I agree. I think you're saying it as a little bit of a joke, but I think he actually does. I think that that's the truth.
[3382.77 - 3384.33] JULIA LILLIS: Yeah, yeah.
[3384.33 - 3393.21] IRA GLASS: If you had any advice for him, what would you say to him, if you could send a message to him right now?
[3393.21 - 3432.69] JULIA LILLIS: It's funny, because I wouldn't even say it like you don't want to prepare yourself for the worst, because that's just going into it having a bad attitude. I think the way I went into it, going into it really thinking this is going to happen, this is my life and this is how it works out, I think that's the best way to go into it. And then just deal with whatever fallout happens.
[3432.69 - 3466.05] IRA GLASS: Julia Lillis, she now has a baby who calls her mommy, and a second one on the way, and a husband who does not have a British accent but apparently has other good qualities to compensate.
