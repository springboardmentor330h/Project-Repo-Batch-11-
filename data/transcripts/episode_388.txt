[0.53 - 8.24] IRA GLASS: Some kids are at a rest stop parking lot, in the middle of August, waiting to get back in the car. Logan, William and Kieran. A reporter approaches them.
[8.24 - 15.18] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: I couldn't help but notice that there's three of you guys, so the first question that pops into my head is, who's going to have to ride in the middle?
[15.18 - 17.21] BOY: Unfortunately, me.
[17.21 - 20.25] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And how come you're the guy who has to ride in the--
[20.25 - 26.63] BOY: Because those two basically, I don't know. They fight when they're in the middle. He doesn't even want to sit next to him.
[26.63 - 29.94] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: He's pinching your cheek right now.
[29.94 - 31.50] BOY: Pressure pointing, actually.
[31.50 - 40.73] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: So do you feel like this is always going to be your job. As you guys get older, you're always going to be the brother sitting in the middle, brokering the peace?
[40.73 - 44.46] BOY: Yeah. And basically, I'm the mediator.
[44.46 - 46.67] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: How do you mean?
[46.67 - 49.00] BOY: I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[49.00 - 51.72] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: How do you mean you're the mediator?
[51.72 - 62.04] BOY: I'm actually not sure what mediator mean, I just felt like saying it. I think it means a guy who keeps peace. Like keeping them from killing each other.
[62.04 - 64.82] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: They can use a guy like you in the Middle East, maybe.
[64.82 - 66.29] IRA GLASS: One of the little brothers signals for the microphone.
[66.29 - 84.01] LITTLE BROTHER: Get it? Middle East. Because he's in the middle and he's out east. Get it? Middle East.
[84.01 - 103.71] IRA GLASS: There's nothing particularly notable about this rest stop. It's one of thousands all over the country. The kind of place where you'd stop for 10 minutes on a holiday weekend, run inside, use the restroom, by a burger or a coffee. Head back out on the road. But if you stayed for more than 10 minutes, you might end up talking to one of these kids. Or to one of the couples who are dropping off children at college, like this reporter did.
[103.71 - 106.61] MOM: --the last kid off to school, so now we're the new empty-nesters right now.
[106.61 - 108.51] LISA POLLAK: How do you feel about that?
[108.51 - 110.77] MOM: I'm cooking things that I've never tried.
[110.77 - 113.04] DAD: And I'm eating things that I've never tried.
[113.04 - 116.74] IRA GLASS: There's some folks on the way back from a family reunion, might complain about traffic.
[116.74 - 120.84] MAN: --and suddenly a clown truck, filled with clowns, caught us off.
[120.84 - 126.45] IRA GLASS: Or there's this guy, whose entertainment on his weekly four hour drive isn't the radio or the CD player.
[126.45 - 132.66] DRIVER: Well, truthfully, so none of the police folk out there are listening, I usually read the newspaper on the way up. Or a book.
[132.66 - 133.85] LISA POLLAK: Are you kidding me?
[133.85 - 135.58] DRIVER: On the way up.
[135.58 - 138.20] LISA POLLAK: And you've been doing it for six or seven years and you've not had an accident?
[138.20 - 138.71] DRIVER: No.
[138.71 - 146.04] LISA POLLAK: That seems to me to be pure luck.
[146.04 - 163.57] IRA GLASS: There's a family driving six hours to visit their dad in prison. A young couple looking for a place to have their wedding. Two brothers on their way to compete in the rodeo. A 16-year-old standing inside the rest stop, nursing a tea, taking a break from her own family. She's on an eight-hour car trip with her dad, her grandma, her sister, and a couple brother. She explains to a reporter.
[163.57 - 182.15] TEENAGE GIRL: Well, it's very noisy, you could say that. Because everybody's arguing, or talking about sports. We were just having an argument on who's better, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson? And Mike Tyson won. My dad nearly stopped the car to argue and say, "No, Mike Tyson is better. So it was just very hectic.
[182.15 - 188.86] IRA GLASS: Coincidentally, a little later, Mike Tyson's name comes up again, in conversation with a prep cook named Ozzy, who works at the rest stop.
[188.86 - 192.68] OZZY: Sometimes I see movie stars. I see Tyson in person.
[192.68 - 193.44] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Mike Tyson.
[193.44 - 210.52] OZZY: Mike Tyson was here. He has a tiny voice. "Hi, young man. Can I get ice cream?" You know? I see Mario Cuomo. I see this old lady who got a lot of plastic surgeries.
[210.52 - 211.21] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Joan Rivers.
[211.21 - 213.09] OZZY: Yes She was here, too.
[213.09 - 227.20] IRA GLASS: Poor Joan Rivers, that two strangers can get her name across simply by saying, "the old lady who got a lot of plastic surgery."
[227.20 - 255.14] IRA GLASS: Nine of us came to this rest stop with tape recorders on a weekend in the middle of August, the time of year when over 10,000 people pass through this rest stop each day. We thought that, for once, we would not leave after just 10 minutes. We'd stick around and find out who all these people are. Where they're going. What they're thinking about. We found love stories, and hard core partiers, and inexplicably angry people. And all kinds of others. We bring you those stories in this special hour of our show. For this holiday weekend, when so many of us are on the road.
[255.14 - 307.82] IRA GLASS: From WBEZ, Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.
[307.82 - 312.29] ROBERT WOODHILL: I think we have a very strong weekend as we get into the end of summer.
[312.29 - 325.16] IRA GLASS: This is that general manager, Robert Woodhill, a friendly, upbeat guy who carries a folded piece of paper that he pulls out and unfolds and refers to constantly through the day, which has a list of sales figures for every half hour of the day.
[325.16 - 338.82] ROBERT WOODHILL: All it simply is is it's my half hour reports of last year on this day, so I can compare my sales to last year and see where we're at. We do it usually, like, 11 o'clock. And then every hour or so, we take a quick reading just to see where we're at.
[338.82 - 341.05] IRA GLASS: And explain, when is the crazy time?
[341.05 - 359.30] ROBERT WOODHILL: Today, it'll be probably from like 12 o'clock till 7 o'clock. Very solid and steady, and then tomorrow morning it will pick up again. And I think as we're getting to the end of summer-- there's a big race in Saratoga this week, people have booked their rooms for Lake George. And it's the end of summer. People want to go and go on vacation. So I think we're going to have a good weekend.
[359.30 - 379.92] IRA GLASS: We were there taping on Friday and Saturday, two weeks before Labor Day. Just two weeks ago. Because those are the biggest days, in the biggest month here. In August, the rest stop makes a fourth of its money for the whole year. And it's crucial that Robert makes his goals this weekend, because it's built into the rest stop business that there are a couple months every year when it just breaks even, or loses money.
[379.92 - 386.36] IRA GLASS: Also, he wants to do better than his rival. His rival. A rest stop in Maine, run by a guy named Andy Tucci.
[386.36 - 400.25] ROBERT WOODHILL: Anabac north, usually, and I are neck and neck. We never place any wagers, but, you know, they're Red Sox fans, we're Yankee fans. And we go back and forth on that as well as discussing who is going to have the record sales for the day.
[400.25 - 402.15] IRA GLASS: Who won last weekend?
[402.15 - 413.84] ROBERT WOODHILL: Andy. Andy beat me red like a lobster, if you want it. That's what I told him. He beat me both days, but I think I'm going to get it back this weekend. I hope this week, the Yankees sweep the Red Sox and then he'll be really quiet.
[413.84 - 431.93] IRA GLASS: Robert was fully staffed for the rush, he had his best cashiers on. And now he just needed the crowds. The big summer weekend crowds.
[431.93 - 452.94] IRA GLASS: We chose this particular rest stop because a couple years ago, I came here on the way to a wedding and I noticed that a couple of the college students working at the Starbucks were speaking Polish. When I asked, they said, yeah, they were from Poland. Here for the summer, on a special Visa program called the J-1 program, where they live in the United States and work for three months at the rest stop. And then get to travel for a month in America before flying home.
[452.94 - 465.21] IRA GLASS: And it seemed like such a crazy thing to fly all the way to America and then be stuck behind a counter in the middle of nowhere for the summer. I wondered if they felt cheated. I wanted to come back and find out.
[465.21 - 471.19] SANDY: I'm Sandy, and I'm from Taiwan. And I work at Starbucks in Plattekill Travel Plaza.
[471.19 - 494.74] IRA GLASS: There are no Polish students this summer. It's mostly Taiwanese and Ukrainians working in Plattekill. Sandy's name back home is Moche Cho. She's a college junior, an English major. This is her second year doing this summer work program. Last year she was one of hundreds of foreign students who get jobs at Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio. But this year, she wanted to see a different part of the country. And signed up for this location because of two magic words: New York.
[494.74 - 503.95] SANDY: I love New York. Last year, I went to New York City just three days. So this time, I want to stay in New York City more.
[503.95 - 508.90] IRA GLASS: And then, when you got here, were you surprised how far it was from New York City?
[508.90 - 517.36] SANDY: Yes, very surprised. Yeah. So, actually, I'm a little regret about I choose this place, yes.
[517.36 - 536.72] IRA GLASS: She knew the rest stop wasn't in New York City, she just thought it would be a little closer and easier to get to. Without a car, everything's a hassle. So she hasn't seen New York at all this summer. The only place she's gone is some outlet stores. When she's not a work, she hangs around the apartment with five other students, all women, who came over from Asia this summer to work at the rest stop.
[536.72 - 543.65] SANDY: When we have day off, we will go to a supermarket to buy grocery. Yeah.
[543.65 - 544.14] IRA GLASS: That's it?
[544.14 - 549.81] SANDY: Maybe go to a restaurant to eat something.
[549.81 - 552.73] IRA GLASS: What's the best thing that's happened this summer on your trip?
[552.73 - 565.20] SANDY: This summer? So far I didn't meet happiness thing in this trip, so far, no.
[565.20 - 568.38] IRA GLASS: Wait, you haven't had much that's been so good this trip?
[568.38 - 571.04] SANDY: No. So far.
[571.04 - 593.28] IRA GLASS: So this seemed, frankly, a little sad. A bunch of students quietly tolerating their summers, counting the days until they could finally travel the country. Cooking food they don't eat, like hamburgers, and drinks they'd never heard of before arriving here, like Frappucinos. All for people who have cars, at a place that's all about cars, on the side of the highway, but without cars of their own. I felt bad for them.
[593.28 - 597.25] IRA GLASS: And then I started talking to the Ukrainian students.
[597.25 - 598.38] IRA GLASS: And how's it going?
[598.38 - 615.00] JANE: Very good, I think. I really get a very big, huge experience here because I like this place and I want to come back here. It's really true. I'm happy that I am here.
[615.00 - 633.66] IRA GLASS: Evgenia Trekasa to goes by the name Jane or Angelina here in the States. She's 18, entering her junior year of college. It's her first time away so long from her parents, and she misses them terribly. But it's also very exciting. She says that in the first week or two in Plattekill, she and the other Ukrainians felt stranded, same as the girls from Taiwan and Hong Kong felt.
[633.66 - 656.52] JANE: Because we don't have a car, we can't drive. We just can take a bus, so that's why. But then we find friends that when we have a day off, they always can take us, like say, it's OK, we'll show you beautiful places. So when we have a day off, we always go to somewhere. We never stay at home.
[656.52 - 668.60] IRA GLASS: What happened is that the Ukrainians befriended a couple of the American teenagers who work at the rest stop, and those teenagers introduced them to other young people. And before they knew it, they had rides to the mall, to Six Flags Amusement Park, to New York City.
[668.60 - 672.78] ADELAIDE: My name is Adelaide Giron, I'm 19. I work at Roy Rogers.
[672.78 - 682.15] IRA GLASS: Adelaide is a big, cheerful, fun-loving guy, and probably the American who's gotten closest to the Ukrainians. In two years of working at the Roy Rogers at the rest stop, he's seen lots of foreign students come through.
[682.15 - 684.53] ADELAIDE: I think think group has definitely, by far, been my favorite.
[684.53 - 685.23] IRA GLASS: Why?
[685.23 - 708.64] ADELAIDE: I felt like the other groups before, I've gotten attach to them. But this group-- I think it's, I'm in college and they're in college. And we drink and I drink and they drink. And it's a fun experience. I just recently got my license, about two years ago. Actually a year and a half ago. Before that I was driving illegally, so I really couldn't drive all over the place. But now that I got my license, like [BLEEP], I'm driving everywhere.
[708.64 - 723.82] ADELAIDE: So I hang out with them, I take them shopping. At night, we go swimming at this lake. Trespassing. Who cares, though? Just having a good time. We're young. The cops showed up one time. We had alcohol on us. It was a pretty bad story.
[723.82 - 736.88] IRA GLASS: For a while, he says he was going over to their apartment three times a week. Fridays, Saturdays, and Wednesdays for parties. Parties he taught them how to throw. Here's, um, one of his students in this matter, Peter Molov, one of the Ukrainians.
[736.88 - 740.35] IRA GLASS: What's your favorite thing that you've done so far since you've been here?
[740.35 - 769.96] PETER: Favorite thing? Probably the parties. Parties. They're a lot different than our country. If we want to have parties, we just go to the club in our country, in Ukraine. Go to the club. Loud music and stuff. But since we came here, we get to know other Americans, and they said, let's have a party. Well, OK, let's go to the club. Why to the club? Let's do it at home. OK. We got to home, they showed us games they play.
[769.96 - 777.77] ADELAIDE: Beer pong. Introduced them to my beer funnel, they'd never seen that before. We showed them flip cup, we showed them how to I play flip cup.
[777.77 - 779.22] IRA GLASS: I don't even know what this.
[779.22 - 783.60] ADELAIDE: Really? it's good buzz getter.
[783.60 - 786.73] PETER: It is fun. A lot of people play, so it's really fun.
[786.73 - 789.55] IRA GLASS: And you didn't have beer pong back in Ukraine?
[789.55 - 792.29] PETER: No. I never knew.
[792.29 - 795.13] IRA GLASS: Will you be taking that back to show your friends back home?
[795.13 - 801.21] PETER: Oh yeah. We even want to buy beer pong table, special for it.
[801.21 - 803.99] IRA GLASS: I'm not sure they're called a beer pong table.
[803.99 - 818.07] ADELAIDE: They're pretty good for not knowing what beer pong is. We just introduced them to beer pong two months ago, and yet they're better than me. We actually have tournaments going on sometimes, and the Ukrainians end up being on top most of the time.
[818.07 - 824.65] DASHA: It's impossible to drink so much as Americans do. Americans really drink very much.
[824.65 - 831.98] IRA GLASS: This is Dasha, another 19-year-old from Ukraine. She said most of the parties here in America, in their apartment or out by the lake, went until dawn.
[831.98 - 846.46] DASHA: At 6 AM, 7 AM. And then the most fun is then when you work from 9 AM and you don't sleep at all. Like one day, I just slept 30 minutes, I woke up and went to work.
[846.46 - 849.60] IRA GLASS: That was the most fun?
[849.60 - 852.66] DASHA: As for me. I was dying at work.
[852.66 - 854.95] IRA GLASS: Fortunately, she works at a Starbucks.
[854.95 - 875.08] IRA GLASS: The Plattekill Rest Stop has employed foreign students for nearly a decade. They're hard workers and easier to schedule into shifts than American teenagers, who are always needing time off for family vacations and sports practice and other activities. There's a group in the summer, and then smaller groups in the winter and spring. And the Plattekill Rest Stop is a close knit enough place that people cry when they leave.
[875.08 - 898.72] IRA GLASS: One of the managers told me she still emails kids from Brazil and Peru who worked here years ago. At least one marriage has come out of this, between an American worker and a Bulgarian girl. Though all the managers of the rest stop agreed that they like the Ukrainians, they're good kids, but the Ukrainians are the rowdiest group with the most issues they have ever had. Hands down. Probably because the Ukrainians are the first group that were friends back in their home country.
[898.72 - 915.06] IRA GLASS: They came to Plattekill for a summer adventure. "They're having too much fun," one manager told me. Fireworks after 2 AM, complaints from neighbors, the police have come out a few times because of the noise. Robert, the general manager, has no idea where he's going to find them housing if their landlord evicts them.
[915.06 - 937.03] ROBERT WOODHILL: It's been a little bit of a rough summer with them. They're college kids. And I think the thing is, they forget that they're not living in the dorms. They live in an apartment complex where there's families and kids and little kids. They just have to be more respectful at times. It's not like we don't want them to have a good time, you gotta make sure you draw the line someplace and say OK, maybe 1 o'clock is late enough.
[937.03 - 943.12] ROBERT WOODHILL: And, you know, the people are going to work because it's a Tuesday, and you just got to be good neighbors.
[943.12 - 962.94] IRA GLASS: As it turned out, everything came to a head the night before we arrived to record with an all night party that Adelaide says was their craziest ever. A party that was not thrown by the Ukrainians. It was the very first party thrown by the girls from Taiwan. Total turnaround for them. Adelaide says, before this, he and the Ukrainians had only invited them to one party.
[962.94 - 970.93] ADELAIDE: And they really don't drink, so they got drunk off a couple of beers and we just-- they couldn't hang, so we just didn't invite them anymore.
[970.93 - 986.73] IRA GLASS: But now, they threw this party, a goodbye party for one of the girls who was leaving early, and they partied with the best of them. Everybody dancing and making noise. After the second beer run, there was a late night beer fight with people pouring their drinks on each other. As usual, all this bothering the neighbors.
[986.73 - 988.28] IRA GLASS: Then what was it? They complained to the landlord?
[988.28 - 1003.44] ADELAIDE: Yeah. The landlord doesn't like me or my other friends hanging around there. He actually refers to me as a big, crazy Mexican that walks around. So I don't know. I don't think I'm a big, crazy Mexican at all. I'm a gentle giant, really.
[1003.44 - 1005.39] IRA GLASS: And so then Robert had the talk with everybody?
[1005.39 - 1007.68] ADELAIDE: Yeah. He had a talk with everybody.
[1007.68 - 1014.77] ROBERT WOODHILL: It was time to play the heavy-handed Dad and just to make sure that they get the full message that this can't go on.
[1014.77 - 1031.27] DASHA: And that we shouldn't have any more parties here. We should be quiet because if there will be one more party, they will send us home. They will break our contact with Plaza and then there will be no more students in Plaza the next year.
[1031.27 - 1033.97] IRA GLASS: And what do you think of that?
[1033.97 - 1043.49] DASHA: I don't know. I don't really care if they will have any other students next summer. Because I won't be there.
[1043.49 - 1048.00] IRA GLASS: The American kids also got a warning from their boss. Again, here's Adelaide.
[1048.00 - 1058.90] ADELAIDE: Just to stop going over there, the landlord doesn't want me on his property. He sees me or my car, it's getting towed at my expense. I'm going to get charged for trespassing.
[1058.90 - 1061.15] IRA GLASS: And so what are you going to do?
[1061.15 - 1075.43] ADELAIDE: Well, I'll probably still go over. [BLEEP] it. There's really nothing-- if they say anything, I'll just be like, OK, it won't happen again, officer. And, of course, it will happen again.
[1075.43 - 1081.12] IRA GLASS: And do you worry that you could get the Ukrainians in trouble in a way that they'd get sent back early?
[1081.12 - 1090.87] ADELAIDE: I hope not, but if they do, it's all a good time. And I told them that if anything happens, I'm deeply sorry. But whatever happens, happens. There's nothing we can do.
[1090.87 - 1108.74] IRA GLASS: And that, everybody says, is the last big party of the year. But no matter. It was still a great summer. I asked Evgenia if she ever felt jealous of all the travelers she saw pass through the rest stop. People on the way to vacations while she was stuck working. And she said never. She'd come so far to get here.
[1108.74 - 1126.87] JANE: They should be jealous of me. Because I'm here.
[1126.87 - 1133.90] LISA POLLAK: Inside the rest stop, right when you enter the lobby, between the bathroom and the food court, is this room full of racks of brochures.
[1133.90 - 1137.73] IRA GLASS: Lisa Pollak is one of the gang of nine reporters that we had at Plattekill.
[1137.73 - 1160.17] LISA POLLAK: You know those brochures you'll see in the lobby of a discount hotel? The ones advertising local attractions that inevitably, no matter where in the country you are, include a water park and underground cavern tour? It's that. Floor to ceiling. This is the New York state information center. It, confusingly, is run not by New York state, but by a private company that charges businesses to display their pamphlets here.
[1160.17 - 1177.22] LISA POLLAK: The manager of the center is a guy named Lenny Wheat. He also stands behind a counter, offering travel advice to the lost. When I talk to Lenny, he gets this look on his face, almost like he feels a little sorry for me. Because I think I'm in the middle of nowhere and he thinks I have no idea what I'm missing.
[1177.22 - 1182.46] LENNY WHEAT: Right here, at the next exit alone, you have best rock climbing in the country here.
[1182.46 - 1183.40] LISA POLLAK: Seriously?
[1183.40 - 1195.17] LENNY WHEAT: Yeah. It's the Napa valley of the east around here. We have the oldest vineyards, the oldest winery. One of the best wineries. You have the best hotel resort spa in the United States in the area here, too.
[1195.17 - 1196.68] LISA POLLAK: Wait, how do you know it's the best?
[1196.68 - 1204.67] LENNY WHEAT: That's according to the Mobil Travel Guide and Day Spa Magazine. I got one of the best dude ranches in the country up here by New Paltz, too.
[1204.67 - 1205.29] LISA POLLAK: No you don't.
[1205.29 - 1209.95] LENNY WHEAT: Yes. Rocking Horse Ranch Resort. Great place to take a family.
[1209.95 - 1216.81] LISA POLLAK: By the time Lenny tells me about something called the Catamount Adventure Park-- largest adventure park in North America, according to the brochure--
[1216.81 - 1219.11] LENNY WHEAT: There's 120 things to do there.
[1219.11 - 1237.87] LISA POLLAK: I am so overwhelmed by superlatives that I just take his word for it. Lenny knows this area. He's a local. Lives eight minutes away. And he used to drive for a messenger service, so he's an expert in giving directions. I found it especially impressive when he told travelers the exact number of miles between highway exits by memory.
[1237.87 - 1245.28] LISA POLLAK: But Lenny actually ended up in this job by accident. His neighbor used to work here, and Lenny would visit him from time to time to help out.
[1245.28 - 1271.98] LENNY WHEAT: And he was feeling ill one day. And I was like, he says, you think you can stay here and do this? And I'm like, sure, why not? I mean, I know my way around. I know the roads, so. And he had some issues, diabetes and stuff, and wound up taking timeout and stuff. He recently passed away and stuff. But, you know. Kind of like, sometimes you feel like what you've done in your life-- when it comes together, it's like you were meant to do something, you know?
[1271.98 - 1274.30] LISA POLLAK: So you're saying it kind of seemed like it was meant to be?
[1274.30 - 1276.93] LENNY WHEAT: Yeah, sometimes it feels that way.
[1276.93 - 1299.18] LISA POLLAK: I hung out with Lenny for a couple hours. I saw him cheerfully field dozens of information requests. Everything from where to buy beer-- nowhere at the rest stop, but try New Paltz, there's a lot of college kids there-- to how to get to Maryland-- crucial first step, turn around. Maryland is south of here, you are headed north. When anyone wanders in to browse, Lenny pounces.
[1299.18 - 1300.86] LENNY WHEAT: What's your destination of today?
[1300.86 - 1302.54] LISA POLLAK: "Lake George," the guy says.
[1302.54 - 1307.57] LENNY WHEAT: OK, can I get you anything for Lake George? We just got in the Fall Events guide, too.
[1307.57 - 1308.27] TOURIST: Sure, if you want to.
[1308.27 - 1313.32] LENNY WHEAT: Anything for Washington county, on the other side of the lake? Anything on hiking?
[1313.32 - 1313.96] TOURIST: No.
[1313.96 - 1316.26] LENNY WHEAT: Waterways? Whitewater rafting?
[1316.26 - 1317.32] TOURIST: Waterways.
[1317.32 - 1318.92] LENNY WHEAT: Waterways, OK.
[1318.92 - 1330.23] LISA POLLAK: Even though all these places are paying to advertise here, Lenny gets genuinely excited when he's pitching them. If he doesn't believe the Plattekill Rest Stop is the gateway to vacation gold, he sure fooled me.
[1330.23 - 1338.34] LENNY WHEAT: And if he didn't know it, in Karo, there's bear statues all around the village, and there's treasure hunt going on with that. OK?
[1338.34 - 1339.02] LISA POLLAK: Here's another one.
[1339.02 - 1344.49] LENNY WHEAT: And that is also the best concert facility in the world. Loggins and Messina's playing tonight.
[1344.49 - 1345.15] MAN: Who?
[1345.15 - 1346.03] LENNY WHEAT: Loggins and Messina.
[1346.03 - 1348.55] MAN: Messina the comedien?
[1348.55 - 1349.97] LENNY WHEAT: No.
[1349.97 - 1350.91] LISA POLLAK: And one more.
[1350.91 - 1352.85] LENNY WHEAT: And the world's largest kaleidoscope there, too.
[1352.85 - 1354.42] MAN: Oh, beautiful.
[1354.42 - 1372.55] LISA POLLAK: At a time when people plan their trips on computers, and drive to them using GPS, it's a little surprising that a place like this even exists. I actually watched Lenny pull out a magnifying glass for a guy having trouble seeing a map. By the time I left, Lenny had me almost convinced that what he has to offer is better than the Internet.
[1372.55 - 1390.40] LENNY WHEAT: You can see here, in 10, 15 minutes look through the pages, and see most everything every county might have to offer you. You know how long it would take you to find all that on the Internet? You turn the page, you got shopping. You turn the page, you got your fishing, your antiquing, you know.
[1390.40 - 1396.41] LENNY WHEAT: How you doing, guys? Where you going to?
[1396.41 - 1420.28] IRA GLASS: You know, you don't really go on a long car trip with strangers. Usually you're with people who you know really, really well. And being confined in a car together, in a tiny space, staring ahead at the road, it's one of the nicest places to talk. Have a long, long talk. One woman told us that she actually plans things to discuss with her husband and her kids when she knows that they're going to be in the car for hours.
[1420.28 - 1431.98] IRA GLASS: Another woman, this mom named Elizabeth McMann, was driving from DC to Albany wit her nine-year-old. It's a long drive. And the son decided that he was going to use the time to get to the bottom of some things.
[1431.98 - 1458.88] ELIZABETH: He's been on this whole Q and A thing. Where, mom, who do you like better, your sister or your brother? Uncle Jenny or uncle Chad? Or how long would you cry if I died? Or would you rather be married to your boyfriend or to daddy, who's-- we're divorced. It's been kind of weird. So that stimulates some conversation. He just asked, for example, mom are you really Santa Claus?
[1458.88 - 1475.37] IRA GLASS: The reporter who talked to that woman was Jonathan Goldstein. He mostly has stationed himself outside the rest stop, in the parking lot by the picnic benches. Somehow everybody Jonathan talked to seemed to be enjoying their time on the road to the max.
[1475.37 - 1495.28] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Stan is sitting on the bench in front of the parking lot. Unlike everyone else you see, people looking to eat, looking to get to a washroom, Stan looks perfectly at home, smoking a cigar like he's got the world on a string. Like hanging out a rest stop is the best part of any vacation. He's waiting for his girlfriend, who he likes to call--
[1495.28 - 1497.25] STAN: The war department.
[1497.25 - 1499.02] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And, by which, you mean?
[1499.02 - 1512.41] STAN: It's my girlfriend. The war department, or the wife is the war department. Get with it baby, let's go baby. You know, it's always-- the sky is very clear and blue today. That's not blue. That's not blue, it's not clear.
[1512.41 - 1513.92] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Have you guys been arguing a lot in the car?
[1513.92 - 1528.79] STAN: No, we never argue. She told me to say that. This is me. See this, under the thumb. Yes, dear. Yes, dear. That's me, right there. Yes, dear.
[1528.79 - 1548.34] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And yet, in spite of Stan's take on couplehood, one, perhaps, modeled on Warner Brother cartoons of the 50s, it looks like there's still a never ending line of people all too eager to sign up. Case in point. A group of four women come striding across the parking lot in the midst of a bachelorette party.
[1548.34 - 1553.86] WOMAN: It's a surprise, because it's a bachelorette party. We're taking her away somewhere she's never been before.
[1553.86 - 1555.72] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And how do you feel about that?
[1555.72 - 1560.14] BACHELORETTE: I feel like I need to know where I'm going pretty soon.
[1560.14 - 1562.37] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Do you even know in what direction you're heading?
[1562.37 - 1563.97] BACHELORETTE: North.
[1563.97 - 1565.41] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And that's it? That's all you know?
[1565.41 - 1573.96] BACHELORETTE: Well, the only thing I know is that I need flip flops, a whistle, and something else. Flip flops and a whistle.
[1573.96 - 1578.57] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Now does that really come into play, or are you just messing with her mind at this point?
[1578.57 - 1580.84] WOMAN: It's very important. It's very important to the whole evening.
[1580.84 - 1583.69] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Flip flops and a whistle. I'm thinking some--
[1583.69 - 1585.56] WOMAN: And comfortable clothes.
[1585.56 - 1605.93] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: All right, now I'm going to ask you guys-- I'll ask you to step over there. I'm going to ask these guys what they got planned. I won't tell anything. By the time this airs, it won't make a difference. So you're just going to go stand over there. I'm sorry. Because now I'm going to get the scoop. All right. Just crowd in here. All right. So flip flops and a whistle, what's that all about?
[1605.93 - 1616.73] WOMAN: It's all crap. It's complete crap, we're making the whole thing up.
[1616.73 - 1619.09] JACK: My name's Jack, man.
[1619.09 - 1620.21] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And where you coming from?
[1620.21 - 1624.81] JACK: I'm coming from [BLEEP] Boston, heading to West Virginia.
[1624.81 - 1626.75] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: What's your last name?
[1626.75 - 1631.88] JACK: I ain't getting into that right now. No last names on this. I've been drinking.
[1631.88 - 1651.48] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: As it turns out, Jack is not the one driving. He's traveling with a couple friends back from [BLEEP] Boston, where he's dropped off his four-year-old, who he spent the summer with in West Virginia. Jack has four kids in three different states. Each of their names are tattooed across his upper torso. Jack is on his way home.
[1651.48 - 1656.47] JACK: Got lost a couple times, you know, so. Took us, like, 12 hours.
[1656.47 - 1658.64] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: So, how long was he with you?
[1658.64 - 1661.13] JACK: Probably like three or four months.
[1661.13 - 1664.07] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And you only get to see him during the summer?
[1664.07 - 1673.75] JACK: I get him for Christmas. You know how the women are. They don't want to pay for all the Christmas presents and stuff. You know what I mean? They all make sure the kids are with me for Christmas.
[1673.75 - 1677.93] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And you saw his mom, too, when you pick him up and drop him off?
[1677.93 - 1683.61] JACK: Oh yeah, I still got the big red marks on my back where she tried to beat me up.
[1683.61 - 1684.35] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Are you kidding?
[1684.35 - 1703.50] JACK: No man. I'm for real. Don't bring your new girlfriend to your ex-wife's house. That's all I got to say. That baby's mama drama stuff, you know. She's on crutches. She broke her leg a few weeks ago. She tried to beat me up with her crutches. You know.
[1703.50 - 1705.40] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Your new girlfriend's in the car with you now?
[1705.40 - 1720.86] JACK: Yeah, man. That's the pretty blonde over there in that black car. You walk over there, you'd be surprised, though. Her and my buddy driving, we call him Hot Wheels. He's a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, so, you know, we nicknamed his ass Hot Wheels.
[1720.86 - 1724.76] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: I walk across the parking lot to a big, black, rusty car.
[1724.76 - 1726.94] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Jack told me they call you Hot Wheels?
[1726.94 - 1733.49] HOT WHEELS: Yeah, cause I'm always in a wheelchair. Tore my foot off.
[1733.49 - 1734.76] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: How did that happen?
[1734.76 - 1746.72] HOT WHEELS: Car crash back in 2006. Hit a wall at about 100, what do you expect? You don't even expect to walk away from something like that.
[1746.72 - 1749.34] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And you are? You are in the back seat here?
[1749.34 - 1750.13] KRISSY: Krissy.
[1750.13 - 1752.22] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: You're also from West Virginia?
[1752.22 - 1753.12] KRISSY: Yes.
[1753.12 - 1754.07] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And how old are you guys?
[1754.07 - 1755.50] HOT WHEELS: I'm 21.
[1755.50 - 1756.27] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And Krissy?
[1756.27 - 1757.69] KRISSY: 24.
[1757.69 - 1759.21] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Do you do much traveling?
[1759.21 - 1763.97] KRISSY: No. Not at all. I'm a stay at home mom.
[1763.97 - 1765.77] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: How old are your kids?
[1765.77 - 1768.32] KRISSY: I have one who's nine.
[1768.32 - 1771.78] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: So you don't get a chance to travel very much?
[1771.78 - 1774.14] KRISSY: Right. It's been a long trip.
[1774.14 - 1775.67] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Is this the furthest you've been?
[1775.67 - 1785.44] KRISSY: Yes. Went to New Jersey once before, but, other than that, this is definitely the farthest and longest.
[1785.44 - 1789.66] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: And have you've been in a lot of parking lots like this? A lot of rest stops?
[1789.66 - 1795.95] KRISSY: Actually, no. I think this is probably the first rest stop I've ever come to.
[1795.95 - 1797.74] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Not in your life?
[1797.74 - 1801.36] KRISSY: Yes.
[1801.36 - 1803.54] JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN: Really?
[1803.54 - 1819.99] KRISSY: I don't just live in West Virginia, I live in West Virginia. And I don't ever go anywhere.
[1819.99 - 1857.48] IRA GLASS: Coming up, Love in the Middle of the Night. And much more. That's in a minute. From Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues.
[1857.48 - 1861.79] ROBERT WOODHILL: I'm still waiting for Andy's report back, let me see if he sent anything back.
[1861.79 - 1880.81] IRA GLASS: 3 o'clock. Friday. Robert, the general manager of the rest stop, checks his BlackBerry for an email from his rival, in Maine. Andy Tucci. Noon to 3:00 was supposed to be some of the busiest hours of the year for Robert, but he does not look happy. He's not hitting the half hourly goals in that piece of paper that he carries around with him.
[1880.81 - 1904.83] ROBERT WOODHILL: I am down a bunch from last year. About $3300 behind last year and $600 behind last week. Which is not a normal thing. So, it's a little cause for concern right now. So right now, we're not sure why. There doesn't seem to be a lot of traffic problems. We can make it up-- in an hour and a half we could make it all back and be right where we're supposed to be.
[1904.83 - 1915.72] IRA GLASS: Every couple of hours when I check with Robert, this is what he says, "We can still make it up. The rush still can come." Robert is optimistic. Mostly.
[1915.72 - 1918.08] IRA GLASS: I wonder how it's going in Maine.
[1918.08 - 1926.52] ROBERT WOODHILL: I haven't emailed Andy yet. But I'm afraid to email Andy right now. I'm sure it's going very well. I mean, maybe that's a good thing I haven't heard back from Andy.
[1926.52 - 1930.39] IRA GLASS: It's starting to get a little overcast outside.
[1930.39 - 1934.62] ROBERT WOODHILL: So, what, are you wishing for rain here?
[1934.62 - 1937.48] IRA GLASS: Actually, he tells me, rain isn't always bad.
[1937.48 - 1955.72] ROBERT WOODHILL: If it rains at the right time, people get backed up in traffic, then they got to stop. Because now they've been in traffic a little longer, so. Perfect timed rainstorms would be nice. And maybe not too hard. I think that'd be good. Because people will get out of their car and walk in a light rain. But they don't want to walk in a downpour. If it's a downpour, they don't come out of the car.
[1955.72 - 1958.87] ROBERT WOODHILL: We'll keep our fingers crossed. Still got a lot of night to go, so.
[1958.87 - 1960.21] IRA GLASS: Fingers crossed.
[1960.21 - 1962.48] ROBERT WOODHILL: You're killing me, man.
[1962.48 - 1966.47] IRA GLASS: Within 25 minutes, the skies literally blacken.
[1966.47 - 1968.78] IRA GLASS: [THUNDER]
[1968.78 - 1985.17] IRA GLASS: And it is the wrong kind of rain. The kind that includes tornado warnings one county over. The kind where you do not run from your car across the parking lot to buy a nice sandwich or a hot coffee from Robert. The kind that if it could just please one person on this earth, and that person was in Maine.
[1985.17 - 1992.33] ANDY TUCCI: I would say, probably, by his last email, we're probably right in the same boat. Right in the same area.
[1992.33 - 2004.20] IRA GLASS: Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Tucci, Robert's rival. General manager of the Kennebunkport Travel Plazas and, his day, actually, wasn't going great either. Yet.
[2004.20 - 2011.30] ANDY TUCCI: Yeah, I just shot him an email letting him know that we'd be busy later on after the Red Sox game.
[2011.30 - 2013.35] IRA GLASS: I see. Oh, you think you can make it up later?
[2013.35 - 2019.79] ANDY TUCCI: I think so. They'll be a lot of people on the road later on, celebrating. Well, at least Boston fans will be.
[2019.79 - 2020.93] IRA GLASS: Celebrating, huh?
[2020.93 - 2023.01] ANDY TUCCI: Celebrating. Absolutely.
[2023.01 - 2026.46] IRA GLASS: Now, later on, does he have anything going on?
[2026.46 - 2032.55] ANDY TUCCI: You know, I don't really believe he has a whole lot going on down there tonight. You know, the Yankees being on the road.
[2032.55 - 2034.87] IRA GLASS: So it's looking pretty bad for him?
[2034.87 - 2044.40] ANDY TUCCI: I would say so.
[2044.40 - 2067.57] IRA GLASS: At one point, finally, one of the concession stands, Nathan's Hot Dog, does get a real rush, with a line that extends to the middle of the food court. This is where speed becomes crucial. Robert says that if people walk into the rest stop and see a line, and if the line doesn't seem like it's moving, they'll walk out without buying. So his staff has to pour it on during the rush if they're going to make their goals and, of course, beat Maine.
[2067.57 - 2072.32] IRA GLASS: Sean Cole went behind the Nathan's counter to watch the action.
[2072.32 - 2075.39] SEAN COLE: Every now and then during the rush, Nathan's runs out of food.
[2075.39 - 2077.08] HEATHER: Wow, there's only one corn dog.
[2077.08 - 2092.39] SEAN COLE: Heather Rafertee's working one of three cash registers. One corn dog is a problem since a customer's been waiting a long time for two. They prepare as well as they can here, but there's only so much food you can cook in advance. Heather has to grab parts of other people's orders just to keep the flow going.
[2092.39 - 2096.83] HEATHER: I'm taking one of your large fries. You're waiting on others anyway.
[2096.83 - 2112.62] SEAN COLE: It's like putting together a puzzle where a lot of the pieces are exactly the same shape. And it would be easy if it wasn't so hard. People are fanatical about Nathan's and workers joke about it. They feel like saying, "You know, Roy Rogers has food too." Luckily, Heather's break is imminent.
[2112.62 - 2117.11] HEATHER: In four minutes. Four long minutes.
[2117.11 - 2125.02] SEAN COLE: Four long minutes later, she clocks out, and snakes through the maze-y hallway in the back. On her way out the back door for a smoke, she walks up to another worker--
[2125.02 - 2125.72] HEATHER: Alex.
[2125.72 - 2142.22] SEAN COLE: And gives him a quick passing smooch, which made me feel like I was really behind the scenes. Alex is Heather's boyfriend. About four months ago, they had a kid. A little boy. I ask what it's like to live and work together, but Heather says they don't. She lives with her parents right now. And the baby.
[2142.22 - 2158.28] HEATHER: And Alex lives with his family. We're still together, definitely. We plan on moving in together at some point, it's just that right now money tight, and this was kind of-- as much as I love my son, he was kind of a surprise, so. But eventually, down the road, me and Alex will move in with each other.
[2158.28 - 2160.90] SEAN COLE: And you're thinking of getting married and--
[2160.90 - 2172.17] HEATHER: I'm hoping so. We've been together for two years now, so I'm definitely considering it, but. He's 20 years old. He just turned 20 in June, so he's still young, so.
[2172.17 - 2172.61] SEAN COLE: And how old are you?
[2172.61 - 2174.15] HEATHER: I'm 21.
[2174.15 - 2184.11] SEAN COLE: Heather and Alex are a mixed couple. She works at Nathan's. He works at Brioche Duree, the pastry and sandwich shop at the rest stop. This has led to a little inter-restaurant tension in the relationship.
[2184.11 - 2191.15] HEATHER: He's like, well, I worked this shift. And I'm like, well I worked this shift and it was busy like this. And he's like, well, it was like this. We get into debates.
[2191.15 - 2192.34] SEAN COLE: Over who is more busy?
[2192.34 - 2196.77] HEATHER: Yeah. And which one's more crazier and which one's more harder, so.
[2196.77 - 2206.58] SEAN COLE: I've not been privy to these debates, and I don't work at the rest stop. But no one's fanatical about Brioche Doree. Nathan's is way harder.
[2206.58 - 2219.17] IRA GLASS: Across the lobby, all the way across on the other side from Nathan's, over in the Travel Mart, another one of our reporting team, Gregory Warner, was there when cashier Clara Dragon started her shift.
[2219.17 - 2238.11] GREGORY WARNER: First thing Clara does on her shift, before she rings up a sale or even opens her register, she picks up a three-foot cardboard display of Purell hand-sanitizer and sets it down on one side of the cashier's counter. It's a simple maneuver that blocks and redirects the flow of customers. Without it, she'd get bombarded from both sides.
[2238.11 - 2247.09] CLARA DRAGON: Because they'll come over here ahead of the other people and it causes an argument. So I barricade it so that they know they got to go over there.
[2247.09 - 2250.36] GREGORY WARNER: This stack of two ounce Purell--
[2250.36 - 2266.83] CLARA DRAGON: Keeps them from standing here and cutting the people off. Everyone says I'm crazy, but I do it immediately when I come in. Because it saves arguments. You don't want to rile them up, more than they already are.
[2266.83 - 2276.81] GREGORY WARNER: Clara grew up in a rough part of Astoria, Queens, and spent her youth staying out of the way of trouble. At Plattekill she's worked nine years, as waitress, and then cashier.
[2276.81 - 2285.66] CLARA DRAGON: I was a waitress in Bob's Big Boy. And when they shut that down, and they opened this and I jumped in here.
[2285.66 - 2286.77] GREGORY WARNER: So, um--
[2286.77 - 2292.17] MAN: Ask her if she voted for Barack Obama and if she thinks he's a good president or is he a [BLEEP] meatball.
[2292.17 - 2297.07] GREGORY WARNER: A tall guy with a sunburn and the pink polo shirt wags a Butterfinger bar.
[2297.07 - 2302.24] MAN: Ask her. She'll tell you. Do you think Obama is going to give you free health care? And do you think you deserve it?
[2302.24 - 2315.24] GREGORY WARNER: Clara looks up at the angry man. She wears bifocals and shimmery eye shadow. She doesn't say anything. She just smiles. It's a smile so genuine that the man can't help himself. He smiles back.
[2315.24 - 2316.70] MAN: Well, I don't like the Democrats in general--
[2316.70 - 2327.29] GREGORY WARNER: The guy continues talking politics, but less belligerently. Clara still doesn't say a word. And by the time he collects his change, he's halfway apologizing. Clara hasn't spoken.
[2327.29 - 2333.30] MAN: You know what? We were stuck in New York, man, bad traffic. You have a good day. Excuse my language.
[2333.30 - 2340.87] CLARA DRAGON: It's all right. That's an example of what we deal with. And you've got to smile.
[2340.87 - 2343.41] GREGORY WARNER: That's an example of what you deal with?
[2343.41 - 2380.25] CLARA DRAGON: Yeah. Not all the time, but sometimes. They're battling the roads or this heat or traffic, especially. They're coming in fuming. They're even rough with their families. You know, so. You just say, oh, I'm sorry. I rush to get them out so that they don't have to be any longer than possible. I only had one run in with someone, a while back, who got on my goat and I yelled back at him. Which we're not supposed to do, but he just got me.
[2380.25 - 2382.61] CLARA DRAGON: I was doing a fax for a truck driver.
[2382.61 - 2384.65] GREGORY WARNER: There's a fax machine under the cash register.
[2384.65 - 2414.36] CLARA DRAGON: And my head is down and all of a sudden I hear, "You're very rude." I pick my head up and he says, "You're very rude." He says, "You're doing whatever you're doing down there," he says, "you're not paying attention to me." I said, "I'm doing a fax for someone, it's important." "No, it's not," he says. "I don't give a heck what you're doing down there. I'm going to report you," he says. "And it's going to make my day." I couldn't take it. I says, "You do that if it makes you happy."
[2414.36 - 2418.18] GREGORY WARNER: That's it. That's the one time she yelled at a customer.
[2418.18 - 2420.65] CLARA DRAGON: You have a good night.
[2420.65 - 2435.49] IRA GLASS: After midnight, only a few businesses are still left open in the rest stop. There's a gate blocking that room with all the New York State pamphlets, but a promotional video plays inside, in the room, behind the gate, all night long.
[2435.49 - 2439.69] IRA GLASS: [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[2439.69 - 2448.44] IRA GLASS: Two people from our team of reporters, Jay Allison and Nancy Updike, stayed up for the midnight to 8 AM shift. Here's Nancy first.
[2448.44 - 2456.24] NANCY UPDIKE: Between midnight and 8 AM, the first question isn't where you going, but why? Why are you awake at a rest stop when it's--
[2456.24 - 2457.36] WOMAN: 2 AM.
[2457.36 - 2458.42] NANCY UPDIKE: Or even--
[2458.42 - 2463.43] MAN: What, 4 AM, I believe. Yeah. 4 AM in the morning, so.
[2463.43 - 2467.03] NANCY UPDIKE: Notice they're both laughing. It's funny. But seriously.
[2467.03 - 2469.45] NANCY UPDIKE: Is this where you intended to be at 2 AM?
[2469.45 - 2472.81] WOMAN: We had no idea what time we would be here, actually.
[2472.81 - 2475.33] MAN: We didn't make any plans, actually.
[2475.33 - 2479.78] WOMAN: We figured we would drive until we got tired, and then hopefully find a place.
[2479.78 - 2483.62] NANCY UPDIKE: We'll call those people the non-planners. And then there are the planners.
[2483.62 - 2493.05] WOMAN: That's the way my son likes to drive, with no lot of traffic on the road. So that's why we on the road this time in the morning.
[2493.05 - 2498.33] NANCY UPDIKE: And then there are the people Jay's talking to, the bad planners.
[2498.33 - 2515.81] JAY ALLISON: Over at one of the tables, Sebastian and John are getting their last hot meal before they switch to granola. They're headed into the Adirondacks, to start hiking at dawn, and they're in a good mood, laughing a lot and talking, maybe a little nervously, about bears.
[2515.81 - 2520.43] JOHN: Bear bell? I'm all right. Dinner bell for them.
[2520.43 - 2524.85] SEBASTIAN: I'm here, I'm here, come by.
[2524.85 - 2526.52] JAY ALLISON: Are you worried about bears?
[2526.52 - 2529.45] JOHN: Well, they say they're pretty active up there, so.
[2529.45 - 2536.58] SEBASTIAN: You see them all over. Especially when you have food around you. They come visit you, definitely.
[2536.58 - 2543.95] JOHN: You got to watch out for them. Can't keep no food. That reminds me, I forgot the bear canister at home.
[2543.95 - 2547.21] JAY ALLISON: Wait, so you forgot to bring the thing that you put the food in--
[2547.21 - 2555.18] JOHN: Yeah. It's a bear canister. You put all your food in, anything with odors. You seal it up and you stick it about 100 yards from your tent.
[2555.18 - 2556.99] JAY ALLISON: That's a good idea. Where is that, in your apartment?
[2556.99 - 2563.89] JOHN: Yeah. [LAUGHING]
[2563.89 - 2575.20] JAY ALLISON: Out in the parking lot, Tony and Debbie Longo are lost, and it's Tony's fault. The thing about Tony is, he's not supposed to get lost. He's a New York City homicide detective.
[2575.20 - 2582.10] TONY LONGO: I don't know how I missed that exit. I don't know how I missed it. Big sign. Tappan Zee Bridge. There it was.
[2582.10 - 2584.31] JAY ALLISON: When you're a cop, you're not supposed to make mistakes.
[2584.31 - 2588.90] TONY LONGO: Not the direction. The direction thing has to be down pat. I lost control.
[2588.90 - 2594.70] DEBBIE LONGO: I really, I hate my whole family right now. They didn't want to leave in the morning. God forbid we leave in the morning.
[2594.70 - 2596.42] JAY ALLISON: Next time you'll leave in the morning.
[2596.42 - 2597.39] TONY LONGO: Oh, we'll leave in the morning next time.
[2597.39 - 2599.58] DEBBIE LONGO: Next time we're not coming.
[2599.58 - 2609.31] JAY ALLISON: It's after three in the morning, and they've been lost for hours, and Debbie Longo says she's not a happy camper. But you can tell she is.
[2609.31 - 2617.87] DEBBIE LONGO: There's the soft serve. And it's not taking my money. I don't care anymore. I don't care. I'm going to get fat and I don't care. I'm going to blow up like a balloon, and you'll have a big fat wife.
[2617.87 - 2625.81] TONY LONGO: That's OK. But we stay happy.
[2625.81 - 2649.97] NANCY UPDIKE: Isn't there some truism about, if you want to test your relationship, go on a long drive together. What I'm saying is, I'm expecting a lot of grouchiness here at the rest stop, during the graveyard shift. Instead, I keep seeing couple after couple walk up to the glass doors of the rest stop, and reach for each other's hands, right before they walk through. Instinctively. Like, here we go, you and me.
[2649.97 - 2655.19] NANCY UPDIKE: Couples of every age. 20s, 40s, 60s. What are your names?
[2655.19 - 2656.81] EDETTA: Edetta.
[2656.81 - 2657.77] PETER: And I'm Peter.
[2657.77 - 2671.67] NANCY UPDIKE: Edetta and Peter are on a five-hour drive to pick up their kids from summer camp. Their first time at camp. In other words, a Parenting 101 trip. Unexciting, long, and happening at an inconvenient time. But listen to them laughing.
[2671.67 - 2675.38] NANCY UPDIKE: Did the kids want to go, or did you say, you're going?
[2675.38 - 2681.08] PETER: We kind of made them go.
[2681.08 - 2687.61] EDETTA: And our oldest left for college, exactly for the same time, so. It works well.
[2687.61 - 2694.22] PETER: Free time for ourselves and they had free time for themselves.
[2694.22 - 2698.68] NANCY UPDIKE: It's, at this point, that I blurt out the most obvious, and inappropriate, question.
[2698.68 - 2702.99] NANCY UPDIKE: What did you do with your free time? Which they handle admirably.
[2702.99 - 2705.82] EDETTA: We really had time to connect.
[2705.82 - 2712.55] PETER: Had some romantic dinners. And spend time together.
[2712.55 - 2716.33] NANCY UPDIKE: When was the last time you had time to do that, before this?
[2716.33 - 2717.78] PETER: 20 years ago.
[2717.78 - 2719.71] PETER: [LAUGHTER]
[2719.71 - 2722.88] EDETTA: Right behind the van.
[2722.88 - 2728.57] NANCY UPDIKE: And there's more giddiness inside the rest stop. Another couple, Lisa and Marcus.
[2728.57 - 2733.66] LISA: Did you see me? Giving him little kisses and telling him how cute he was when he walked in?
[2733.66 - 2752.47] NANCY UPDIKE: Lisa and Marcus, as you can tell, are in deep. They're looking at a map on the wall of this half-closed rest stop, on their way up to Lake Champlain to go camping. It's the middle of the night. They've gotten lost already. Not sure where they are going to sleep. But the two of them cannot stop smiling. I can feel endorphins radiating from them in waves.
[2752.47 - 2757.01] NANCY UPDIKE: They met salsa dancing, less than a year ago, and love is making them ambitious.
[2757.01 - 2761.07] LISA: We are planning on maybe moving to Argentina.
[2761.07 - 2769.83] MARCUS: And we started already dancing tango here, in Philadelphia. So we want to become professional tango dancers, and that's a joke.
[2769.83 - 2774.48] LISA: No it's not.
[2774.48 - 2789.25] NANCY UPDIKE: Outside the rest stop, Katarina and Johnny are sitting next to each other on a bench. Not a bench in a beautiful park. A bench looking out on a highway, in a parking lot. Of course they don't care. In fact, they seem not to have noticed at all.
[2789.25 - 2791.00] KATARINA: We are going to Montreal, Canada.
[2791.00 - 2792.23] NANCY UPDIKE: You're going to Montreal?
[2792.23 - 2795.80] JOHNNY: We're coming from New York and we're going to Montreal.
[2795.80 - 2814.60] NANCY UPDIKE: Johnny's finishing up his residency, but he's not sure he even wants to be a doctor. 35 years old, with more than $200,000 in school debt. But he doesn't want to talk about that. He's on a road trip with his girl. He brushes off my questions, leans into the microphone, and steers us back to what we should be talking about.
[2814.60 - 2830.02] JOHNNY: [SINGING] Love me tender, love me true, never let me go. I love that guy.
[2830.02 - 2847.30] NANCY UPDIKE: But, even at a rest stop that's fizzy with love, there is heartache. As I'm standing outside, a man asks what I'm doing. So I ask what he's doing. We end up talking for a while. His name is Dan. He's driving back to upstate New York after a day in New York City.
[2847.30 - 2850.00] DAN: Spent some time with my boys.
[2850.00 - 2850.99] NANCY UPDIKE: How old are they?
[2850.99 - 2854.54] DAN: 19 and, oh my god, 23.
[2854.54 - 2856.56] NANCY UPDIKE: How often do you see them?
[2856.56 - 2867.72] DAN: Not often enough. I'm trying to make it more regular because I just got divorced, like a year or so ago. They are staying with their mom, so I'm seeing less of them. Probably get to see them like once a month.
[2867.72 - 2871.16] NANCY UPDIKE: How's the divorce for them?
[2871.16 - 2879.92] DAN: I don't really know. It seems to be OK for them, you know. It's a little weird, still. You know, we still try to do things together and--
[2879.92 - 2881.22] NANCY UPDIKE: You and your ex-wife and the kids?
[2881.22 - 2887.61] DAN: No, I don't do these things with her anymore. Last year, my son's 18th birthday, we went sky diving together.
[2887.61 - 2888.37] NANCY UPDIKE: All four of you?
[2888.37 - 2895.00] DAN: Yeah, all four of us. She wanted her boyfriend to come, and I was like-- I actually called him and said, don't come.
[2895.00 - 2896.20] NANCY UPDIKE: You called him?
[2896.20 - 2900.30] DAN: I called him. Left him a message. A very polite message. I was like, Michael, please don't come.
[2900.30 - 2902.39] NANCY UPDIKE: You know him? You have his number.
[2902.39 - 2925.88] DAN: Yeah. I knew him, yeah. It was a tough thing. She wanted him to come and go on my son's 18th birthday. Really, it was just too weird. It's a very weird thing, you know. Trying to be friends with your ex. And then you can't really be friends. And then when you have this other girlfriend. It's just such a difficult thing.
[2925.88 - 2943.26] DAN: She didn't want me to go to the house to pick the boys up. And then, you know, one week we're having a good conversation and the next week something like that comes up, and you're like [GASP]. You have the thing, you want to call that person and yell at them, and talk to them about it, but you don't have that relationship anymore.
[2943.26 - 2949.84] NANCY UPDIKE: That's a hard moment. When you realize, right, we don't have that relationship anymore.
[2949.84 - 2953.67] DAN: I tried to go to counseling and stuff, and tired to get her to come back.
[2953.67 - 2956.10] NANCY UPDIKE: She didn't want to go to counseling?
[2956.10 - 2968.14] DAN: She went with me one time, but then, she wouldn't stop seeing this guy. This other guy she was seeing. So that kind of-- I made her pay the co-pay, and we left.
[2968.14 - 2969.48] NANCY UPDIKE: This other guy, Michael.
[2969.48 - 2997.88] DAN: Yeah. Instead of trying to work stuff out with me, she was trying to work stuff out with him, so. I do think about it a lot. I beat myself up for, you know-- where did I go wrong as a father? As a husband, or whatever. I'm basically 45 years old, and I figure half my life is over, and I'm really trying to figure out what to do the next half.
[2997.88 - 3020.08] NANCY UPDIKE: I know this is just a rest stop. But really, some kind of love force field is in effect here tonight. Because guess what? Dan has a new girlfriend. She's at the rest stop with him, just doesn't want to talk into a microphone. They met through a singles group and they've been together long enough that they've started meeting each other's kids. It's still complicated. But wow. It feels great.
[3020.08 - 3030.89] DAN: I just told her tonight, I don't know what I would without somebody else in my life. It's just-- I found a woman that really loves me, and I'm just, like, so over bowled by that.
[3030.89 - 3031.79] NANCY UPDIKE: Like miracle.
[3031.79 - 3045.52] DAN: Yes. It is. I'm optimistic about the future. Very optimistic.
[3045.52 - 3050.87] JAY ALLISON: In the parking lot, when I first saw Stevie G. from a distance, I thought he was naked.
[3050.87 - 3054.80] STEVIE G.: Right now, I'm de-kinking the muscles in my buttock.
[3054.80 - 3061.53] JAY ALLISON: Then he kicked one leg in the air above his head and I saw he was wearing little white gym shoes.
[3061.53 - 3064.82] STEVIE G.: It opens up the fountain of youth in the front of the hip joint.
[3064.82 - 3089.67] JAY ALLISON: And then he jumped into a pool of light, and I saw he actually had on some tiny black nylon shorts. Stevie G. teaches body work, pilates, yoga, massage and such, and he's stopped at this rest stop to stretch and move. It's hard not to notice though, that while Stevie is working out in the parking lot, he is simultaneously smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.
[3089.67 - 3097.86] STEVIE G.: It's what I am, you know. Unfortunately, I'm polluting my lungs. They're doing well, you know. I clean them out on a daily basis.
[3097.86 - 3100.26] JAY ALLISON: How do you clean them out?
[3100.26 - 3115.62] STEVIE G.: Usually a mixture of running and steaming and meditational breathing. And not swallowing what I cough up. I always spit it out. Like I have a little cup, I can spit out all that-- I never swallow it.
[3115.62 - 3127.47] JAY ALLISON: Our conversation, by the way, is happening next to Stevie's vehicle, which figures largely in his life. It's an old yellow school bus he got up in Woodstock to start a volunteer service program.
[3127.47 - 3137.42] STEVIE G.: Picking up the drunk people, like, going into the bars and finding the ones and saying, all right, who looks really bombed, offer them a free ride home.
[3137.42 - 3154.53] JAY ALLISON: But now Stevie G. has a larger vision for the bus. He wants to build a health center made of school buses. Before he leaves the rest up, Stevie G. gets out a big foam roller and takes it to his favorite spot for a final stretch.
[3154.53 - 3192.98] STEVIE G.: All right, we got all of the big 18-wheeler trucks on one side. We got all the smaller cars over here, on the other. We are on 87 highway. This is where I think it's the cleanest. You just got to watch out to see if the dogs have been here. Abracadabra. Scoop that belly, burn the jelly, America. You've got to get off of your fat one, and do something good. Something good like the solid oak would. Get out there and help others. And especially, help yourself, to be your best. So that you are not a cranky old fool that we all got to pull up the hill.
[3192.98 - 3203.60] JAY ALLISON: Stevie rolls all around the sidewalk, with truckers looking down at him from their cabs. He doesn't notice. When he's all loosened up, he picks up his roller and heads back to his vehicle.
[3203.60 - 3204.36] JAY ALLISON: [ENGINE STARTING]
[3204.36 - 3214.30] STEVIE G.: Oh, it sounds good. That's my baby. Take care.
[3214.30 - 3215.80] JAY ALLISON: Take it easy.
[3215.80 - 3237.11] JAY ALLISON: Stevie G. coughs up some phlegm, spits it out, and heads off for Woodstock.
[3237.11 - 3260.04] JAY ALLISON: It's morning. English sparrows are congregating like crazy in the trees just outside the rest stop doors. Standing out in the parking lot, nine-year-old Brian Belco looks kind of like a bird, actually. His eyes are bright, his arms are stiff at his sides, and held out a bit like wings. And when he speaks into the microphone, he bobs his head forward, like he's pecking at it.
[3260.04 - 3262.72] BRIAN: We're going fishing up in Swanton's Mine.
[3262.72 - 3264.79] JAY ALLISON: Yeah? What are you going to catch?
[3264.79 - 3268.07] BRIAN: Bass, pike, pickerel, perch.
[3268.07 - 3270.52] JAY ALLISON: Sounds like you've done this before.
[3270.52 - 3276.59] BRIAN: Yeah. But the tradition started with my family started with my great-grandfather.
[3276.59 - 3277.72] JAY ALLISON: Is that right?
[3277.72 - 3297.71] BRIAN: My great-grandfather was a great fisherman. He really liked fishing, so-- so he went up to Lake Champlain. And some of the cabins were built right over the historic battlefield of the war in 1842, the Battle of Lake Champlain.
[3297.71 - 3299.96] JAY ALLISON: You're a student.
[3299.96 - 3302.81] BRIAN: This is my first radio interview ever.
[3302.81 - 3304.76] JAY ALLISON: Really? You did great.
[3304.76 - 3307.28] BRIAN: I know. I'm really, really excited.
[3307.28 - 3308.12] NAN: Say goodbye.
[3308.12 - 3308.95] BRIAN: Bye.
[3308.95 - 3314.06] JAY ALLISON: Bye. Have a great vacation.
[3314.06 - 3337.03] IRA GLASS: And with a new day here, we have just the time for one final note before we go. Final tallies from the battle between the rest stops in Plattekill and Maine. At the end of the afternoon, after our two days in Plattekill, I can report to you that business never really picked up for either rest stop. And, after two days, on Saturday afternoon, Robert told me he only had one consolation for the weekend. He beat Andy.
[3337.03 - 3366.09] ROBERT WOODHILL: I'm the king for the day. I beat Andy, and the Red Sox got smacked around and massacred by the Yankees. The unfortunate thing is being king for the day when you miss your sales by $7,000 isn't so good. And everybody was down. It was a bad day for everybody. Maine. Andy set out a quick note, not hitting his numbers at all. But, you know, we're ready for next weekend. Still got two more weekends to go. I still think they're coming. In this business, you've got to be positive.
[3366.09 - 3396.53] IRA GLASS: When I left, he was around $12,000 down for two days. 7% or 8% lower than where he needed to be. But, all this rain, he said, could make for really beautiful leaves upstate come the fall. A lot of people could get on the roads for that. To look at those leaves. He could still turn this around.
[3396.53 - 3398.53] IRA GLASS: Our program was produced today by Sean Cole, myself, with Alex Blumberg, Jane Feltes, Sarah Koenig, Lisa Pollak, Alyssa Shipp, and Nancy Updike. Our senior producer is Julie Snyder. Production help from Aaron Scott, Seth Lind is our production manager. Our music consultant is Jessica Hopper.
