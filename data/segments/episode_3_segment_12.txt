I was told to contact you if I wanted to get in touch with Yona Lu in order to book Duki. What do I do next? MRS. MATTOON: Book Duki, OK. You're going to book Duki. IRA GLASS: That's the whole idea. I want to book Duki for the show, for an interview. MRS. MATTOON: Well, I'll just talk to Yona Lu about it. She says OK, it's OK. IRA GLASS: Will Yona Lu want to discuss terms or something? MRS. MATTOON: She doesn't talk. IRA GLASS: So what's going to happen? All right. Should I call you back? MRS. MATTOON: You could call me back.
