BENTON HARBOR: What's that? WOMAN: A napkin-folder in a nouveau Italian-Chinese restaurant specializing in pizza and light salads. Takeout available. Mmm, I'm hungry. BENTON HARBOR: Wednesday morning, 9:30 AM. My Chicken Alarm goes off a half hour late for my geriatric counseling appointment. Tire still flat. So I take the convenient number 18 bus. And that leaves me off only 28 blocks from the counselor's office. COUNSELOR: I have one word of advice, Mister. Get out. BENTON HARBOR: Excuse me? COUNSELOR: Get out. BENTON HARBOR: OK, I'm a few minutes late. COUNSELOR: What? You're 30 years too late. Get out. BENTON HARBOR: Oh, you mean get out, not get out. COUNSELOR: May I suggest a small, desert, superhero retirement community.
