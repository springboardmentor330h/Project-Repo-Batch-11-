I mean, there's really not much else to do and, so-- CANDIDO TIRADO: One morning. CARMEN RIVERA: There's a beautiful prehistoric town, and we start kind of connecting and talking about the history. One morning we're eating breakfast in a beautiful restaurant that's built into the rock. And it's a very clear day. And we're on the patio. And you can see Sardinia. And it dawned on me, wow, we're two Puerto Ricans from the Bronx and we're here and we see Sardinia and this beautiful day. And I look over to Candido and I'm like, wow, I'm really glad I'm sharing this with him. CANDIDO TIRADO: I was feeling the same way. CARMEN RIVERA: So Sunday morning was the seventh day.
