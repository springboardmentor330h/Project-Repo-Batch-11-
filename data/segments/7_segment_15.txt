IRA GLASS: I wonder how long you're going to feel this way, how long you're going to be this interested in quitting. EVAN HARRIS: I don't know how long I'll be interested in quitting. I think maybe what you're suggesting is that I'll get it out of my system and I'll be over it and it'll be done. But as I said before, I have quit everything. I don't, in a very literal way, have anything to quit anymore. I have no city. I have no boyfriend. I have no home. Not that those are the only things in life. I mean, I suppose I could quit smoking or quit eating things that are bad for me. There's a lot of little quits that I could execute which I might do just to tide me over. But the thing about quitting is that it runs on a cycle so that now or soon-- not quite yet-- but soon, I'll be building more things up which I will quit.
