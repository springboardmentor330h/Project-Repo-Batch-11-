I said, "Uh, what are you guys called?" He said, "We're the Space Station." "Well, where do you guys broadcast from?" "Carol City." I said, "Do you, like, have a license or anything?" And DJ Funky One started laughing really hard, and he said, "Yeah, yeah. We got all that , man." And then he hung up on me. Carol City was at the very north end of the county. It had originally been a white, suburban subdivision, but eventually, it was where city planners tried to get the rising black population of the '60s to move to when the city needed new slum land as far away from downtown as possible. These days, it's a seedy, menacing residential sprawl of little homes and gang graffiti known widely as a place where kids from white, suburban subdivisions go to buy drugs. I rode up there, but I found no more graffiti clues to the station's whereabouts. Later, with a car radio, I found that you couldn't even get the station that well north of 125th Street, which is about 60 blocks south of Carol City. So I think that DJ Funky One was probably lying about Carol City.
