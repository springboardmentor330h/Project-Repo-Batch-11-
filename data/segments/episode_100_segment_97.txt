There was no boat, no Swedish women. You were ahead of your time. Thank you. In a certain way-- you're trying to get freedom for your homeland-- do you view this kind of speech, which, I have to say, Howard Stern is often criticized here in the States for the things he says and the way he is. Do you view this as being, in a certain way, what freedom is all about? Yes, obviously, that is freedom. It is irreverent, but it is freedom. It is honesty.
