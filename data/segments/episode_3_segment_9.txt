And the rationale for that is what? DANIELLE: It freaks Duki out. IRA GLASS: It freaks him out, though-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten? DANIELLE: I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good-looking and strong, and that he's really smart and has a lot of friends. DANIELLE: He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him that. I say, "Duki, give me a break. You're just stuffed." And he's like, "No way." IRA GLASS: Now I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this show.
