IRA GLASS: Maybe you remember the book A Clockwork  Orange, the book and the movie. They're about teenage boys who love ultra-violence, commit murder, do all sorts of horrible things, speak to each other in a very stylized language. IRA GLASS: At the end of that book-- the movie actually doesn't end this way, but the original British edition of the novel does. At the end of the book, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. And it's not because he thinks it's wrong. And it's not because any of the punishments and treatments that he's received have worked on him. IRA GLASS: He gives it up because he's bored with it. It's just not that interesting to him.
