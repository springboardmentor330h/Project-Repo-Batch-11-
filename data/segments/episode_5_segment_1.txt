But not this one, because from WBEZ in Chicago, it's Your Radio Playhouse. I'm Ira Glass. IRA GLASS: Wasn't that very Saturday Night Live? I got so excited when I did it, you could barely understand the call letters, I bet. Just in case you missed, they were from WBEZ. That's so management doesn't call me up. It's important to them. IRA GLASS: Anyway, tonight on our little radio show, civilization and its discontents, and the people who are discontent with the discontents. And if that doesn't make any sense, just stay with us. Just stay with us. Coming up in our program, stories from Larry Steeger, Iris Moore, Cheryl Trykv, and more, more, more. IRA GLASS: So anger, anger is an inherent part of the current conservative revolution.
