Yeah. All right, here we go. This is a clip, he's talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I said, Fred, let's go chase Arnold into the bathroom and tell him how great we think it is that he's doing Conan The Barbarian. We went in there and he's like, "What?" "Hey, boys." "Hey, boys, please. Thank you so much for nice compliment, but please." "Sorry to bother you, Arnold." "That's OK, boys." Yeah.
