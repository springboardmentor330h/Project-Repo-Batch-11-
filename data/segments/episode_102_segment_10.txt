So I go get Candido, in the back yard studying chess. CANDIDO TIRADO: I carry my chess books with me. CARMEN RIVERA: He has a chess book. CANDIDO TIRADO: My chess board. CARMEN RIVERA: But, you know, we're happy so I don't feel like a chess widow anymore, so it's OK. So I go tell him we have to leave. CANDIDO TIRADO: So we pack. And as we're packing-- and I know something's going to happen because we have to have that blow up, you know? We go outside, and there's a black cloud right on top of the house. And it starts to rain on top of the house. It wasn't raining any other place. There was sun all over the place, except on top of the house.
