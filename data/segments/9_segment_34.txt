IRA GLASS: We have now arrived at Act Two of our program. In this act, Julia gets diagnosed with cancer herself. And one thing that's interesting about these tapes is that once Julia Sweeney actually gets cancer, the stories get less dark. They are less tragic. There is less trouble in them. This next tape is from May of 1995. This is actually the worst sound quality of any of the tapes we're going to play for you today. IRA GLASS: And just one quick word for public radio listeners who perhaps do not watch as much television as many Americans do. SNL-- she refers to SNL. SNL, in this context, is Saturday Night Live. JULIA SWEENEY: So about a month ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.
