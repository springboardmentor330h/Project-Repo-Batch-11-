Can you say something besides losing your job that you want to forget, that happened to you this year? MAN: This year? Well, I just out of jail. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Did it help you in any way, being in jail? Like, straighten up your head? IRA GLASS: He was quiet for a second. His girlfriend shook her head, no. CLAUDIA PEREZ: It didn't help you? Are you still stubborn? MAN: Right. The jail ain't for getting you straight. It just makes you worse. CLAUDIA PEREZ: What do you plan to do for '96? MAN: I don't know.
