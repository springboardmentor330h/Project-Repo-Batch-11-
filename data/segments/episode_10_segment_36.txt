So my ex-girlfriend is reading. And there, in the third paragraph, one of the sexperts turns out to be my mother. IRA GLASS: SHIRLEY GLASS: Hello. IRA GLASS: Hey, Mom. SHIRLEY GLASS: Yeah. IRA GLASS: It's Ira. SHIRLEY GLASS: Yeah. IRA GLASS: So I'd like to do a little interview. SHIRLEY GLASS: OK. IRA GLASS: OK. So Mom, can I read to you a quote from an article? SHIRLEY GLASS: Of course. IRA GLASS: OK. Here it is. "Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement. You could stimulate yourself while he watches or let him participate by moving his hand to where you want it." SHIRLEY GLASS: Yeah. IRA GLASS: That's you being quoted in Marie Claire. SHIRLEY GLASS:  You're kidding.
