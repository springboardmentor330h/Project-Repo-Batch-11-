PETER: No. I'd have to be truly sorry in my heart, or it wouldn't save me. CALEB: That is a very rigid attitude. PETER: What do you mean? I can't just pretend to have remorse. CALEB: You haven't even tried. I mean, the Pope's a very nearsighted, distracted old man. If you buried your face in your hands and pretended to sob, I'm sure he'd buy it. PETER: It's not a question of fooling the Pope. CALEB: You know, I'm starting to think that you don't really want to help yourself. PETER: How did I get here? Why are we playing poker in Italy with a demonic little boy whose grandmother is dying in the next room? PETER: PETER: What was that? PETER: CALEB: A peacock. PETER: Huh. What's that a symbol of? CALEB: Pride.
