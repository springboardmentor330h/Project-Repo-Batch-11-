She gets this kind of ice-cold stare, and she gives you this side long glance that makes you feel like you're about the size of a pea? IRA GLASS: Yeah. DUKI: That's what she does. She not as critical of me. IRA GLASS: Is there anything about the life of a duck that perhaps you could tell our radio audience that we might not know? I'm sure that you know much more about it than we do. DUKI: No, not really. I'm kind of an unusual duck. I'm not really in touch with the whole duck scene, you know? IRA GLASS: You're not in touch with the whole scene, yeah.
