IRA GLASS: And you think you can go to hell for getting a computer on somebody else's credit card? FRED: I don't know. I hope not. I really hope not. It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying. I'm afraid if there's something I've done which just is like the straw on the camel's back, that's going to be what's going to do it. IRA GLASS: How big is this worry? Will this keep you up at night? FRED: Yeah, maybe for a couple minutes. And then I just sort of put it out of my mind, you know? IRA GLASS: His share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult's perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. I didn't think you could do eternity in hell for $800.
