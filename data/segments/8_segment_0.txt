MAN: What's the French electrical supply like over there? PAUL MCCARTNEY: It's good actually. All the equipment's great. IRA GLASS: Well, now that we can look at 1995 from the safe vantage point of 1996-- we're no longer inside 1995-- I want to point out that at this point, no one in American life seems bigger than life. Not the president, not Michael Jordan, not Courtney or Madonna.
