I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, Quitting, stories of people who quit everything in their lives that they hated and what happened to them afterwards. IRA GLASS: Coming up, writer Sandra Tsing Loh, Lisa Buscani, and others. Stay with us. IRA GLASS: So Evan Harris and her friend and coworker, Shelley Ross, were at this job and they started talking about the letter Q. And it was the kind of conversation you can only really have at a job that does not require total concentration. So you're sorting mail, you're frying burgers, you're doing whatever. And so they're talking about the letter Q. IRA GLASS: And again, remember, this is the pivotal conversation in a person's life. They're talking about the letter Q and they get to talking about where it should be in the alphabet. And in their minds, Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is, with the hoi polloi of the alphabet.
