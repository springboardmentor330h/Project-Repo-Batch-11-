I have no idea. But when I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, "Oh yeah, my main partners are married men." I said, "Well, you have to think about your own responsibility to the family then, I imagine." IRA GLASS: All these different fathers who contacted you, did any of them say, I'm sorry, I did something that hurt people and I'm sorry? SUSAN BERGMAN: Well, no. Because there's a lot of talk trying to defend the position that's just newly being articulated in their lives. And I understand that they're building their ramparts or whatever. IRA GLASS: That position being, I was right to at least clear up this lie. SUSAN BERGMAN: Finally, I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual.
