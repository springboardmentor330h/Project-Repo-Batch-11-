I believe in damnation, though. PETER: How can you believe in damnation but not sin? CALEB: Predestiny. Take me. I was born damned. I'm cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. I knew I was damned the first time I heard the word. DONDI: Your Calvinism relieves you of the responsibility for improving yourself. CALEB: Shut up, kid. CALEB: DONDI: Ow! PETER: What are you doing? DONDI: It's all right, GI Joe. I am strong. CALEB: Yeah, Pete. The kid can take it. Now give me three. PETER: How many, Dondi? DONDI: Four. PETER: You can't have four. The most you can have is three. DONDI: OK. I'll take two. PETER: And two for the dealer. CALEB: 5,000. DONDI: Call. PETER: Call.
