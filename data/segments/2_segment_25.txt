CALEB: Is that it? You betrayed somebody and then didn't feel any remorse? Is that what all those pregnant pauses during the poker banter were about? PETER: Well-- CALEB: How can you say you don't have any remorse when you're practically tearing your hair out worrying about going to hell? PETER: But being afraid of punishment isn't the same as remorse. Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you've done, not just worrying about being punished for it. CALEB: And you don't feel sorry at all? PETER: No. CALEB: Even though you recognize that what you did was wrong? PETER: That's right. CALEB: You know, Pete, you're a very complex guy. PETER: Thank you. WOMAN: They went to sea in a sieve, they did. In a sieve, they went to sea. In spite of all their friends could say, on a winter's morn, on a stormy day, in a seive they went to sea.
