And maybe-- George talks about the burden that he felt that he thought that whites didn't share. And yet I think that in some small way, I feel that burden too, because I don't want to live in a world where we can only live in harmony if we live separately. It just doesn't feel right. IRA GLASS: Well, Laura Finnegan and Karen Hutt of the First Unitarian Church here in Chicago, thank you both very much. KAREN HUTT: Thank you. LAURA FINNEGAN: Thank you. KAREN HUTT: It was fun. KAREN HUTT: IRA GLASS: Well, earlier in our program, we heard a story by Claudia Perez about the year on 26th Street. And we thought that we would end our program with her as well. In reviewing what the year was like in her neighborhood, she also talked about what the year was like in her own life. And she said that her family has actually been pretty sad this year, because a cousin who everybody loved was shot last November, though she didn't want to talk more about that on the radio. IRA GLASS: And this September, she said she had a kind of turning point in her life. She's 18, and she goes to an alternative high school called El Quarto Ano.
