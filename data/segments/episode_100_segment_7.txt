Well, actually, I've been doing a lot of cool things, like being in a band. And I've been writing a lot. But the real reality of it is that I ran out of money. So I'm answering phones, and I waitressed for a while. IRA GLASS: And do you listen to the radio on your job? IDA HAKKILA: I actually tuned into some internet stations. There was a station that I really liked in Calgary that was-- they didn't even play good music, but the people just seemed real. IRA GLASS: Wait, you got onto the internet, and you had to search on the internet for a radio station in Calgary? IDA HAKKILA: I actually went all over every single thing that they put on Yahoo. And I listened to every single station that existed.
