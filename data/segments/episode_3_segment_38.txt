Be listening tomorrow for another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crimefighter the world has ever known. CHICKENMAN: Bock bock bock bock! MAN 1: Chickenman! WOMEN: He's everywhere, he's everywhere! IRA GLASS: More Chickenman. That all-new episode, coming up. IRA GLASS: In the meantime, my friend Verta tells this story. Verta, Vertamae Grosvenor, is a National Public Radio commentator, host of an NPR show called Seasonings. Anyway, back in 1970, she published a cookbook. And she was interviewed about it on television by Barbara Walters. IRA GLASS: And as Verta tells this story, OK, she's on TV, making fried chicken for Barbara Walters. And at some point, Barbara Walters asks her, "How do you tell the chicken's done?" IRA GLASS: And Verta tells her, "You can tell by the sound." Ms. Walters gives her this look which says, basically, "Give me a break," and quickly cuts to a commercial.
