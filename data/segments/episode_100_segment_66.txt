Mr. Novak, let me jump in right quick, if I may. When you say it's kind of a problem, the "it's" in that sentence presumably stands for slavery. So if slavery is kind of a problem-- No, I didn't mean that. OK, what did you mean by that? I meant it's a logical problem that we wouldn't have-- One more thing about the scientific way of making radio-- it is weirdly democratic. Every song is chosen by polling.
