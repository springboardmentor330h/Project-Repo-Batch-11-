PETER: I was looking down from the highest window in the tower. And just how you do-- you know, you try to tap into the place in yourself where you have truly apologetic feelings, because you want to be sincere. You don't want the letter to sound phony. PETER: Except I realized, I discovered that there was no such place in myself, that where that place should have been, there was just an empty hole. And it was frightening. It was like staring into the abyss. CALEB: Go see the Pope. Ask for absolution. PETER: But you have to be repentant. I'm not repentant. CALEB: You could just act repentant. That's what ritual is all about, going through the motions.
