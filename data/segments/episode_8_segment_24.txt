CLAUDIA PEREZ: He held the baby, his wife took her two-year-old daughter's hand, and they walked away down 26th Street in the snow. CLAUDIA PEREZ: IRA GLASS: Claudia. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Yes? IRA GLASS: We should explain what music this is. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Well, this is a tape we bought at the discount mall. It's called Tracks are for Kids. IRA GLASS: The box of it looks like the cereal box, Trix are for kids, with the little bunny. CLAUDIA PEREZ: It's a mix tape. The song here is just to give you a little taste of what the Latinos in the South Side and everywhere else listen to. IRA GLASS: OK, doesn't this music sound more vital, more alive, than the certain music of a certain group of aging baby-boom '60s era-- you, you, beloved listener, you be the judge. IRA GLASS: WOMAN: John and Paul, you recently produced a record by the Silkie. JOHN LENNON: Yes. PAUL MCCARTNEY: Yes. WOMAN: Do you think you'll do any more? JOHN LENNON: Yes. WOMAN: Do any of you go to church? RINGO STARR: No.
