WOMAN 9: Hi, can I help you? REBECCA PERL: Hi, I'm supposed to be admitted. WOMAN 9: Oh, OK. What's the name? REBECCA PERL: Rebecca Perl. WOMAN 9: Perl? REBECCA PERL: I think of it kind of like a pregnancy, like having a child, like the birth. I mean, no one can tell you what it's going to be like. You kind of know it's going to be awful, or that's what a lot of people say. But nobody can really tell you what it's really going to be like, and everyone's experience is really different. And it's just sort of like, you don't have a choice. You're just going to do it. It's just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it's the same thing. It's like this momentum, and it's just going to happen, and I'm going to do it. I mean, it's scary, but I'm just going to do it. REBECCA PERL: My room looks like you could wash it down with a hose, like a vet's examining room. It's an awful mustardy yellow. It overlooks a graveyard.
