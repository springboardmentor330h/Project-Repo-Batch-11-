IRA GLASS: Did you ever feel angry at your parents for putting you in this situation? KAREN HUTT: Yeah, I was very angry about it. But I'm really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. I'm smarter for it, I think. But I was angry at the time. IRA GLASS: Angry in what terms? KAREN HUTT: I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me. IRA GLASS: Did you feel used? KAREN HUTT: I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, "First Black Integrates the School." The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that's integration-bound.
