When Terry imagines what it'll be like when the kid is five, he sounds an awful lot like June Cleaver. TERRY: Making cookies and going to PTA meetings and volunteering for being a chaperone, going to the zoo. Being a kindergarten volunteer. Helping kids cut and paste and keep things out of their mouths. DAN SAVAGE: But Terry doesn't see this as being the mom. This is being a dad like his dad was. TERRY: Well, in my family, I mean, my dad did everything. My dad cooked, he cleaned. He made pies in the summer. He built houses. He reroofed garages. But he also helped with homework. And I feel like I'm doing the same amount of work my father would have done. I kind of feel like I'm sort of following in the footsteps of my own father. DAN SAVAGE: Terry's following the footsteps of his father and I'm following in the footsteps of mine.
