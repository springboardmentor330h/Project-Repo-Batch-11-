IRA GLASS: And they would only communicate through the duck? MRS. MATTOON: Well, Danielle didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duck. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention all she had to do was rev up the duck. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny. DANIELLE: In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, this is probably completely really sick. But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings. It's not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it. IRA GLASS: What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Duki? DANIELLE: Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki.
