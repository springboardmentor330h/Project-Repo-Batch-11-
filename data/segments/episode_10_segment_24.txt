There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community. There is an acceptance of lying because it was needed to survive. And honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it. IRA GLASS: I suggest to him that he's the one who lies, by staying in a straight marriage, and not telling his own children he's gay. He says he's not really lying to his children. As he explains it, there's no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you're gay. When they're 5 or 10, it'll make no sense. When they hit adolescence, it could be confusing, a kind of burden, as they sort through their own sexual identities. IRA GLASS: If his children ask him directly he says, then he'll tell the truth. And he says, they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. JERRY WALTERS: If you want to know something, you will ask the question. If you don't ask the question, either you know the answer or you don't want to deal with the answer.
