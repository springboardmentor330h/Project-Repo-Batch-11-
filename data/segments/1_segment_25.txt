IRA GLASS: OK, let's do. RECEPTIONIST: OK, hold on, please. RECEPTIONIST: IRA GLASS: This is the story of my childhood right there. Dad is a little too busy to talk. But there's the recording of Frank Sinatra when needed. IRA GLASS: SHIRLEY GLASS: Hello? IRA GLASS: Hey, Mom. SHIRLEY GLASS: Oh, hi, Ira. IRA GLASS: How you doing? SHIRLEY GLASS: Fine. Can you hold on a second? IRA GLASS: Sure. IRA GLASS: This is what it's like with my parents. They're so busy. Call them. Put on hold. Baby, what's your hurry? IRA GLASS: When I call my little sister, she works at Disney, and so there's Disney music playing on the hold system. But there's a lot of Disney music.
