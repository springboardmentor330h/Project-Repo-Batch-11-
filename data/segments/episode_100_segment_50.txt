These are the offices of a company that V103 hires called Strategic Media Research. Every day, young women in 10 windowless rooms get on the phone in the late afternoon and early evening and call radio listeners. It's targeted research. For V103, they only call the listeners that V103 wants more than any others. These are 35- to 44-year-old African-American women. They go for women rather than for men for a very simple reason, Tony Gray tells me. Women are more likely to actually fill out the Arbitron diaries, which ratings are based on. In most cases across the country, the stations target females because you know you can rely on the women to fill out the diaries. So they get these women on the phone, and they hook them up to a computer which plays them brief clips of 30 different songs over the phone.
