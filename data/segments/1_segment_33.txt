So we commissioned him to do a little piece about his experience. And here it is. LAWRENCE STEGER: Title. Road. Treatment. It's shot entirely on video, mostly handheld. Shaky, out of focus, bad color. Overblown color actually. Sort of the way colors are separated on an old television console, yet still has all the outlines of the images repeated. The outlines of the images, the silhouettes, repeated over and over, ad nauseam, and fading into each other. LAWRENCE STEGER: Can I get this microphone adjusted a little, so I don't have to lean over so much? IRA GLASS: Yeah, sure. Just pull that. LAWRENCE STEGER: Check one, two, three. Sound better? Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. LAWRENCE STEGER: Synopsis. The story concerns Luke, gay, white, Midwestern, late twenties. Follows Luke on the day that he is informed of his HIV positive status. Luke cops a stance of cold, brittle, not unlike the Harrison Ford narration on Blade Runner, but there's a hint of vulnerability to Luke. LAWRENCE STEGER: Have we got the Harrison Ford or the Rutger Hauer voice?
