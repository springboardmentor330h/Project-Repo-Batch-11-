BENTON HARBOR: Anything else? DUPONT CHOPPER: Yes, you're ugly. BENTON HARBOR: That's my Chicken Mask. The beak and, you know, the feathers. DUPONT CHOPPER: Uh-huh. Well, don't look at small children or animals. Anyway, that's the health story. But I don't think you have to alter your lifestyle, unless you are a crimefighting superhero of some kind. DUPONT CHOPPER: DUPONT CHOPPER: Want to buy one of my tapes? BENTON HARBOR: 12:00 noon. I return to the Chicken Cave. And there, in the chicken mirror-- augh!-- I see something horrible. No, not my ugly face, my own mortality. I ask myself why it never stared me in the face before. After all, I've been fighting crime and/or evil for over 30 years, pursuing it down streets and allies and sewers and other picturesque places. And my mortality never came up even once.
