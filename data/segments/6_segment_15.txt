Outside the building, the trees were green and leafy. But in this room, it was Christmas, even to the several Jews and heretics. A few people stepped outside to smoke or make phone calls. And in a way, I think they really missed out. Maybe they could just hold Christmas inside their heads by re-reading old catalogs or paying bills. But for most of us, these little exercises really helped. The teacher had us start each class with a carol. CLASS: PLAYING GENE LARKIN: And we all shaved ice, wrapped empty boxes as gifts, and sent fake, funny checks to charities. One day, he even brought chestnuts into the class and roasted them, right there, on a small, charcoal grill. CLASS: PLAYING GENE LARKIN: He made a chart of what each magazine paid per word and read us a few examples of their previous holiday stories. PLAYING TEACHER: It was grueling work, but I did it.
