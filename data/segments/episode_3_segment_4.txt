IRA GLASS: Now it is not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle pretty much would dominate Ashley. Danielle always got her way, except, except when Duki was around. IRA GLASS: And basically what would happen is Ashley would channel-- that's kind of an anachronism to use that word in this context-- but Ashley would channel Duki's voice. She would speak as Duki. She would produce the Duki-like voice. And Duki was sarcastic and selfish and bossy. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks. DANIELLE: Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki's hands. IRA GLASS: Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley's personality. DANIELLE: Ashley's very considerate. She's very considerate and kind and thoughtful, and very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy or if someone else doesn't feel good.
