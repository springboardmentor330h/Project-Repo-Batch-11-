It's open 24 hours. It's the place where everyone goes when they get a hunger attack. I usually stop by at 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. They have good tortas, the best tortas. I won't eat tortas from anywhere else. If I'm on a diet, I'll just drink a licuado de fresa instead of a torta. IRA GLASS: It's a noisy, friendly place with bright orange booths, a loud jukebox and the blenders going nearly nonstop, making licuados. At one table was a guy with short hair and a big black and white Adidas jacket sitting with his girlfriend. He had a bad year. MAN: It ain't been good, man. I got fired from my job. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Why'd you get fired? MAN: Because I lied on my application. Because when they ask you, have you been convicted of felonies, I put no.
