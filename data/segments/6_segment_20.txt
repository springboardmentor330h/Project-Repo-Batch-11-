PLAYING COACH: Just a team member and a benched one. PLAYING TEACHER: Remember people, you're all just types. Now, let's get out there and make some money. PLAYING GENE LARKIN: He never asked what we were working on, never assigned us any homework, or shared any of the holiday stories he had written. He lead by example and taught on the sheer strength of his character. Over the weeks, I came to think of him and the other students as family. They started getting on my nerves in little ways. But I couldn't hate them, because, as time passed, we grew to resemble one another, growing out our nails and wearing identical wind-breakers. PLAYING GENE LARKIN: The teacher noticed the change and discouraged us from talking about our stories, for fear of inciting the sort of jealousy that often results in bloodshed or small fires.
