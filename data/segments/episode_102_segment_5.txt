DISHWASHER PETE: I guess I didn't have much more to say than anybody else on the bus. DISHWASHER PETE: Um-- DISHWASHER PETE: All these years I've boasted of being some sort of hardy Greyhound passenger, impervious to all those things that many people complain about. The seemingly never ending rides, the annoying passengers, the claustrophobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and it's no big deal. I sat across the aisle from people having noisy sex and it didn't bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me. DISHWASHER PETE: On the bus to Phoenix, I found myself wedged between the window and a guy who took up way too much of my seat.
