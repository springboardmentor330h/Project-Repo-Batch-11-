CLAUDIA PEREZ: Over near the pet store, the staff of CJ's Clothing is almost all teenagers. One boy is 17, originally from Mexico, from Michoacan. He works but doesn't go to school. This year he met this girl in Mexico who lived in Chicago. He liked her and followed her over here. Eventually, it didn't work. But he stayed here, and now he is making money to help out his family. MAN: CLAUDIA PEREZ: He says he misses his family in Mexico, but if he was there, he says, he'd just be doing drugs instead of making money to help his family. IRA GLASS: His little cousin Ricardo is his interpreter. He translates everything for him. Ricardo had a couple of exciting moments in 1995, like when he helped the police catch a thief at the discount mall. The officers were just standing around watching videos on a store TV, when Ricardo told them that a lady was stealing one of those club things you use to protect your car. But overall, Ricardo summed up 1995 in one word. RICARDO: Bad. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Bad? Why bad? RICARDO: I don't know. Boring. CLAUDIA PEREZ: Boring? Why has it been boring?
