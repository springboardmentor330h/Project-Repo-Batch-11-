They have beautiful furniture, and this is the stuff people in the neighborhood want to buy-- the people with money, and the people without. IRA GLASS: And whatever you've heard about the terrible shape of the nation's retail economy, 26th Street is doing fine. According to the Chamber of Commerce in Little Village, in 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year.

ROSSI SALESMAN 2: There's a definite transformation in the area. All the property's becoming worthwhile. All the empty vacant lots, they're putting new houses there, new construction. So this is becoming a vital part of the city.
