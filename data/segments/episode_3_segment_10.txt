So a few weeks ago, I contacted Danielle's sister, Ashley. And I asked her if Duki could come on the air. IRA GLASS: And I didn't get a call back. I got an answer back by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I would have to call someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mom. And when I talked with Danielle, I asked her about this. IRA GLASS: I've been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu? Do I have that name right? DANIELLE: Yona Lu, yeah. I think she's acting as his agent. IRA GLASS: Yona Lu is-- DANIELLE: She's a hedgehog. IRA GLASS: Anything special that I should say to Yona Lu? DANIELLE: I don't know. She's drives a pretty hard bargain. MRS. MATTOON: Hello? IRA GLASS: Hey, Mrs. Mattoon? MRS. MATTOON: Yes.
