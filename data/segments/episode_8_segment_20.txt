I've seen robberies. That was just a typical robbery. I mean, it could be dramatic to somebody else, or the person that got robbed. But to me, it's just an everyday occurrence for me. So it doesn't phase me anymore. Or as far as people getting shot and killed. I'm used to it. CLAUDIA PEREZ: But something did happen to him that was more dramatic than a robbery or a shooting. MAN: Just dramatic-- I bought a brand-new home. Well, I guess it's not dramatic, but-- CLAUDIA PEREZ: It's good. That's my dream, is to have my own house. I never had a house. I always lived in apartments. That's nice. MAN: Well, I guess, hard work, and-- it's on the Southwest side of Chicago. And it's a split-level home, like a suburban-type home. It's a nice home, side drive, four bedrooms, two-and-a-half-car garage. Expensive.
