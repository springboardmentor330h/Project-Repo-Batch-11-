We told a Chicago playwright named Jeff Dorchen what K-Rad, Fred, and Mr. Warez said about hell and about sin and about their own relative badness in this world. And we asked Jeff Dorchen to write an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. So here's what he came up with. CALEB: I'll call. DONDI: Me too. CALEB: Three 10's. PETER: Full house, aces and eights. CALEB: Ooh. What do you got, kid? DONDI: Four diamonds. CALEB: You got nothing. PETER: See, if you had some where the numbers matched, or if they were in order, and there were five of them. But that, what you have there, that's nothing. CALEB: My grandpa used to call that a kangaroo straight. PETER: My dad used to call it a Klondike. DONDI: Klondike wins the game. CALEB: No, Klondike doesn't win the game. Peter wins the game. Full house wins.
