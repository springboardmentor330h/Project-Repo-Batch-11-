IRA GLASS: LISA BUSCANI: Part two, Love. LISA BUSCANI: When we started, he and I, I was thin. My face was a diamond, all clean walls. Nothing held me back. Not my clothes, not my lack of money. I was weightless but I had control, like astronauts after they learn to swim properly in space. LISA BUSCANI: Our conversations used to overlap and dovetail and interweave, and occasionally we'd stop to breathe. Great pictures of limitless futures, expensive and unfettered. That's how we talked it. I tried to break my visions down to see how to make them happen and he just made his bigger, which is one way of doing it, I guess. LISA BUSCANI: When we made love, we knew how to forget ourselves. That, I'm convinced, is passion. To kiss him so hard and hold him so hard that the act itself is forgotten. And all that is remembered is skin and hair and warmth.
