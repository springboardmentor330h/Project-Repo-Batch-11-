REBECCA PERL: Of course we did have our moments. TOM JENNINGS: If you get upset at me and want me to leave, just tell me to leave. REBECCA PERL: I don't want you to leave,  But this is not about you, so just keep your ego in check. TOM JENNINGS: I'm not talking about my ego. Don't sit there and just sulk and glare at me. Just tell me to leave. REBECCA PERL: All right, I will. REBECCA PERL: I just kind of want him to take care of me. And I think he really has sort of, in a lot of ways, or he is learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do it, just kind of take care of me. I think it's really hard for him.
