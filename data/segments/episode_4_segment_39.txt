Let me see you buff." He had me polish everything from the antenna to the license plate before handing me my pack and driving away. DAVID SEDARIS: I got a ride back to the interstate and another that landed me 20 miles beyond Charleston, West Virginia. It was around 4 o'clock, and I hoped I might catch a long ride that would take me through to Ohio. It was cold, and my hands were chapped from watching that lunatic's car. My fingernails shone from the wax.
