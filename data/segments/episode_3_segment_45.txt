VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: Oh, but did I tell you this one? I have something to tell you about chickens. IRA GLASS: All right, yeah. VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: The chicken and the rooster had a fight. The chicken knocked the rooster out of sight. Rooster told the chicken, "That's alright. Meet you in the gumbo tomorrow night." VERTAMAE GROSVENOR: nan IRA GLASS: Well, the fabulous Vertamae Grosvenor from a studio in Washington, DC. More fun a-comin', writer David Sedaris in New York City. And of course, have we mentioned-- I can't remember. Did we mention the new Chickenman episode, the first one since 1969? Did we mention it? All right. Stay with us. IRA GLASS: DAVID SEDARIS: July 19, 1992. This afternoon, at the 26th Street Flea Market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name.
