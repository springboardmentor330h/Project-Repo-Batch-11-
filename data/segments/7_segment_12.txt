And it could be a big idea. It could be the laws of supply and demand, or Fundamentalist Christianity, or structuralist linguistic theory. Or it could be a small idea. The need for everybody to do aerobic exercise on a regular basis, or the danger of fluoridation, or CIA conspiracies dating back to the Bay of Pigs. IRA GLASS: Who amongst us has not had a conversation on a train, or a plane, or at a party, or an in-law's house, where some earnest-faced person, full of evidence and theory, expounds at length on an idea like, if everyone on the earth would just stand on his or her head for an hour a day, there would be world peace? IRA GLASS: And if you talk to Evan Harris for a while, she'll tell you about the great quits which have driven world history, how, in fact, all the wars and strife of the millennia are, in fact, better understood as a series of quits. And as some people will do when they become obsessed with a single topic, she sometimes delves into quitting issues that are so esoteric, so erudite, that it would be hard, I think, for anyone else to not just understand them, but to care about them. IRA GLASS: For example, she was trying to figure out a system for how to rate the importance of various types of quits. She actually created a mathematical model to do that that she was working on. And during our interview, she repeated several times that quitting had a life of its own, a life separate from any of the quits that you might make or I might make or other people make. In her mind, it seemed that quitting-- was almost like a living thing, separate from the actions of human beings. EVAN HARRIS: Quitting itself has an identity, and your particular quit, one quitter's particular quit, fits into the world and all the other quitters in the world. And you have to remember that your quit is going to influence another person's quit, potentially. The point of quitting is to move in the world and to get bigger and bigger as a person.
