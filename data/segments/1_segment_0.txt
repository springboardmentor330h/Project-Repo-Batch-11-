IRA GLASS: Joe Franklin? JOE FRANKLIN: I'm ready. IRA GLASS: It's Ira Glass here. JOE FRANKLIN: Oh, you're the emcee on the show, Ira. IRA GLASS: I am the emcee on the show. Yes. JOE FRANKLIN: Oh great. Ira? I-R-A, Ira? IRA GLASS: Ira, I-R-A. JOE FRANKLIN: Oh, great. Now hold on one second, Ira. Don't go away. Hello? . Call me after 3 o'clock. I have great news for you. Ira. IRA GLASS: Yes. JOE FRANKLIN: So listen, Tony. If the phone rings, take it in the back. And then come out and tell me who it is. Just say, Joe's being with a camera crew. Just for about 10 minutes. We'll do about five minutes, 10 minutes, right, Ira? IRA GLASS: That's right. IRA GLASS: Well, one great thing about starting a new show is utter anonymity.
