In the summer, people come to 26th Street and cruise around when they're bored. CLAUDIA PEREZ: You come here, cruise for a while, kill time, see who's around, pick up some liquor, and go to the lake. I talked to this girl in the record store about why girls come down here to cruise. GIRL: To check out the guys, I guess. CLAUDIA PEREZ: There's a lot of cute guys. And sometimes it's sad because they're gang-bangers. But they're the finest ones. GIRL: Even if you don't want to really socialize or hang around with them, at least you'll take a look at them. You just get this tingly feeling inside. CLAUDIA PEREZ: You can't pass on 26th Street without noticing Rossi Brothers.
