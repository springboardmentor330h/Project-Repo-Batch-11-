Who is it? Well, no, good news, 6 o'clock. IRA GLASS: Well, Joe Franklin, thank you very much for being with us on our premier show. JOE FRANKLIN: Ira, I'm going to be a listener and a fan. And let's always be in touch. JOE FRANKLIN: IRA GLASS: All right, Your Radio Playhouse. All right. I'm making eye contact with you right-- wait, how does Joe put it? Wait a second. JOE FRANKLIN: Look right in the eye. Eye contact is everything. IRA GLASS: I am making eye contact with you right now. That is just how much I have already learned. OK, so the thing about new beginnings is that there are the ones that we actually undertake and then there are the ones that we just wish for. And the ones that we wish for pretty much outnumber the ones that we really undertake.
