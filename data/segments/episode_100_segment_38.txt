Mrs. Anna E.  or Leekis--  of Lowell, wife of Charles E.  Calling hours are at the-- no, this is another one. I'm sorry. She's evidently already been buried, Mrs. I could not turn the stories off, whether it was assistant city manager Virginia Dolloff getting fired because she hadn't done enough to stimulate growth along one part of lower Middlesex Street, or sewer commissioner Tom Moran who, now a candidate for selectman, was worried that his sewer experience might peg him as a one-issue politician, or the account of Representative  breaking his leg. But the story that had me spellbound for 10 minutes was a long and treacherous account of the annual meeting of the Dracut Water Supply District. It was rich in character and subterfuge, a mini Shakespearean drama.
