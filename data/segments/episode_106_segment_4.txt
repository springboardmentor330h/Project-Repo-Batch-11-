So suddenly the whole project of moving went from being a near disaster to being a delight. And every time we moved Sara would run downstairs to see whether they had, in fact, brought some of their stuff over, because they had to do it in several different trips, right? SARA WESCHLER: Yeah. LAWRENCE WESCHLER: And each time, it would turn out that they had brought some stuff over, right? SARA WESCHLER: Yeah. LAWRENCE WESCHLER: Parenthetically, it was fairly easy to know what they had because it had all been in my pockets, as I'd been picking it up over the many months of the correspondence. I had a whole shoebox full of stuff that Sara had been leaving for the Borrowers, so I just kind of transported little sprinklings of it each time we moved some of our stuff over.
