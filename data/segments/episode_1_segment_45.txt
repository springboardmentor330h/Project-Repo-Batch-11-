Everything has to be perfect and exact the way it's heard. And everything has to be like that. There's no going against the grain. ED RYDER: And here, in the world, people are a little different. They don't concern themselves so much with that, as much as how are you entertaining us? How are you helping us to feel better about ourselves? How are you making us feel better?
