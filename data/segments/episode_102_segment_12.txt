As we walk down this straight, narrow road I started thinking about the soldiers in World War II when the war was over. And they were going home and they had won the war. And Carmen and I are walking-- CARMEN RIVERA: We looked at each other, and we talked about that, this war that we'd just been through. And it just felt so peaceful and-- CANDIDO TIRADO: So right. CARMEN RIVERA: I fell in love again. It was really beautiful. CANDIDO TIRADO: Thank you. CARMEN RIVERA: Thank you very much. IRA GLASS: Carmen Rivera and Candido Tirado told their story during an evening of traveling stories held by The Moth. They're playwrights. Both of them have plays running at the Spanish Repertory Theater in New York.
