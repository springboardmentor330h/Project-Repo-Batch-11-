DONDI: Of course. Gentlemen, the game is Chicago low. Ace, no face, sevens, follow the queen. PETER: Wait a second, Dondi. Caleb, could I talk to you alone for a second, over there, by the window? CALEB: Sure, Pete. DONDI: I will go fetch us some delicious ginger ale. CALEB: Good idea. What is it, Pete? Think the kid's trying to hustle us? PETER: No, I just wanted to talk, that's all. CALEB: What's the matter? PETER: Nothing. Just I'm afraid of going to hell. CALEB: What? Why? PETER: I just don't think I'm a very good person. CALEB: That's ridiculous, Pete. You're a very nice guy. You write letters. I never write letters. PETER: Yeah, but what if you do something bad? How bad does it have to be? I mean if-- do you have to-- if you feel like it's bad enough to damn you, are you damned? I mean, if you don't feel any remorse?
