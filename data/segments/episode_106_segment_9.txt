LAWRENCE WESCHLER: IRA GLASS: The house is crawling with them. IRA GLASS: Lawrence Weschler is the author of Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders and Calamities of Exile. Sara Weschler just graduated from elementary school this week. When we spoke she said that she would be listening to our radio program this weekend in the car. SARA WESCHLER: I don't want us to listen to it at the house. Because if there are still Borrowers in our house, I don't want them to hear that and think that they can't trust me. Because it's right now, I'm like telling their whole story. So I feel like I'm sort of betraying them, you know? And I just like wanted to make sure that they knew that, you know, if I actually did meet one, I wouldn't tell anyone. I would never tell a single person in the world.
