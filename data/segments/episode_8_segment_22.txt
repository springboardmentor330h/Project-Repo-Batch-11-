Everything's been nice. We've got nice blessings this year, you know. We've been together for a long time. We've already been together for four years. And they say they don't last, young couples, so we've really been lasting together. So that's real memorable. IRA GLASS: He's 22 and she's 21, Mario and Alice Ramirez.
