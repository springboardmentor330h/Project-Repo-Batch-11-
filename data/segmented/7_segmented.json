So during the position preparations were, I mean, this is just me thinking back, but I'm sure that the Biden team did the same thing, which is to come into the White House very, very prepared with a short list, a medium list, a long list, and to the extent that some of these folks, again, return to Judge Jackson. second circuit, and U.S. District Court judged Michelle Childs a favorite of Congressman Jim Clyburn. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the nominee will receive a prompt hearing and be confirmed with all deliberate speed with some Democrats telling reporters that he's aiming for a time frame similar to the Amy Coney Barrett nomination, which was done in about a month.

So if the White House wants to move this quickly and the Senate is on board, I mean this could be... down in a month or two. So obviously once the nominee is announced, I think Biden said today, the nominee will be announced before the end of February. They do the thing where they meet with senators for a bunch of conversations before the confirmation hearings begin. What are those conversations usually ? And do you have any tips that you'd give to the nominee specifically before her conversation with Joe Manchin and Kiersten Settler?

What issues do you think will get a lot of attention based on both the people who are potentially on the short list? and just the political legal environment that we're in right now. I mean, it's so it sounds dry but administrative power I think is really an important question. So this , this Supreme Court in right now in a fairly low profile way, but I feel we my co-s and I are trying to spring from the rooftops about it, but whether we're talking about actually curtailing the federal government's abilities to respond and meaningful to the COVID pandemic or being to hobble the environmental protection agencies, ability to actually meaningfully respond to climate change. I mean, these are gonna be hugely pressing legal questions, but this administration, per future administrations, and Justice Breyer was very supportive of the power of the federal government to address hard problems in creative ways and of administrative capacity. And I think that's actually really, really critical. that any nominee be on the record as supporting, because that's going to be so important going forward. I mean, I also think criminal justice issues, justice prior was fairly moderate in certain respects. And we do have a chance to change the court somewhat by putting forth a nominee who is more protective of the rights of criminal defendants, less generally deferential to police and prosecutors than justice prior sometimes was. And it's also, Justice Breyer was, because very much a compromiser on issues of religious liberty and religion in the public square and so it might be possible for the White House to put up a nominee, one of these three that we've been talking about, who might be more concerned about excessive entanglement of government and religion and more concerned about protecting equality interests if they come into conflict with religious exercise about claims.

I think that, , and maybe three of them dissenting in all these cases that we're talking about. Now, the abortion case will probably come down by the end of the term, but look, abortion might be illegal in 26 states by this summer, right? this is, we're in a crisis moment. And so, and this won't be the last case, there will be more cases on abortion and contraception care. And so I think that having a liberal block of this all women, maybe speaking with one voice, is going to be really, really important, maybe in particular in focusing the public's attention on the court, which I really think that the court, the public has been insufficiently attentive just how much this court is working to change at a break-knit pace. And so I think maybe this could change that dynamic. You've talked about some of the issues where the nominee, the central nominee, may differ obviously the nominee won't shift the ideal. I'm wondering about the inter-court dynamics. I read that Breyer was considered a pragmatic liberal who did a good job of finding compromise, arguments that may have helped sway John Roberts in some cases the one, , the verdict of a cold Obama pair. Do you agree with that and do you see the inter-court dynamics changing at all with this nominee? I think every nominee fundamentally changes the dynamics on the court so I think it's almost inevitable that there'll be some change and I do think that no prior was more and less effective.
