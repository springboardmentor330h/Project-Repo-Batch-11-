Therefore the she-held, Jesus answered, said, Martha and Martha, they are careful and troubled about menacing.

Unless you go here and then that's not the okay. So we will not serve God joyfully if we don't spend time at Jesus' feet. Think about this. Ritualistic, cold service is not what the Lord seeks. He's not looking for people who just go through it. If you remove relationship from service, that service is not honoring or pleasing to the Lord. So even in our day-to-day service, we... We have the Lord, the Lord wants this personal relationship. He's not just a God who looks out upon billions of stars that is part of him, but he also sees us and he wants this relationship with us, even in our personal service that we have with him. So the Lord wants us to serve him, as we serve him, with a heart that is warm and loving.
