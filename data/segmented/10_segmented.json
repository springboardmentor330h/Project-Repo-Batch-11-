And one of the things that the president has really- struggled with because of that structural deficiencies that Democrats have immediate is grabbing the nation's attention and one way to do that is to just is the brakes of eggs right has some conflict and this speech will get way more attention because you went directly after dropping the key and giving in a very good speech that just was an implicit subtle implicit White House Council group contrast just going out for the present piece. 13 times in the speech was was a smart move. I also think we should say HatTrack doesn't apply to the president so that's in terms of the president's speeches. Yes, yes, president could say what he wants.

And I think that there was a lot of times tonight where he probably more times than his staff would , that he went off script.

All of that are offered by people who most likely have not seen him give a speech in three years.
