Well here's how I know that that's not going to happen because it's probably going to be his budget because the last time he was president he put cuts social security and Medicare in his budget every single year he was president.

That hasn't happened for almost a century. And so why would you believe it would happen now? But then after doves, those ads started becoming more effective. Because once Republican extremists take something away, that this seems, everything's on the table. You're going to take constitutional rights away from people. And so that you saw people more open-s Horizontal human rights\uc219ischenab circumstantial rights under time fell some concessive And while abortion was the topic in the most as of 2022, not for behind that, we're a cut social security medicare, particularly in Arizona or Mark Kelly and that Super PAC sport hearing ran a ton of ads against Blake Masters on that. The second thing that's really important about how you talk about this is the reason that Donald Trump Republicans want a social security medicare is not just that they think it should work to be dying as he government and they think we have. Joe Biden and Donald Trump have now won enough delegates to clinch their parties nominations, and it was quite a week for the presumptive Republican nominee Trump floated Medicare and Social Security Puts that he's now trying to walk back, promised to pardon the January 6th insurrectionist on the first day of his second term, a group that includes convicted felons who violently assaulted police officers, and Trump also visited his number... and some Darwinian hellscape where only the richest survive. It is because they need to pay for another $2 trillion tax cut that they are planning to pass at the end of 2025. The Trump tax cuts provide for Ben Shapiro. Yes, they use tax cuts every time they're in the past. And then you just keep working and not retire.

It's really fascinating because I write message box newsletters on a lot of topics and I wrote on the Social Security one and you can almost feel just the difference in engagement in an open rate which means something else is security and something on the democracy or abortion. And part of the reason, I think this is a bias in the press that's almost economic, which is when you look at these polls, the things that are most concerned to the more politically engaged college educated upper income scale voters are, specifically, Democrats are democracy, abortion, those are things which are incredibly important issues, but those are the people who are subscribing to their time. People who are watching MSNBC and CNN, people may be listening to this podcast and it is on the issues with people who are less politically engaged, this matters a lot, so you need a lot of repetition to get it in front of them. And the upper income thing is a real issue there too, because it's people who are not lying awake at night thinking, am I going to have to wait and retire at 75 or 80 because I don't know. I'm gonna be able to get some skin on your head. I mean, that is a real, real issue. Or we physically able to keep working. Yes, right?

And I totally understand the argument that prominent public figures saying the word abortion could help lessen stigma around getting an abortion, which is a very important thing to do. But one thing I would urge everyone to remember is the abortion rights movement. didn't win in red states Kansas and Ohio and Kentucky by speaking only to people who favor no restrictions on abortion. They won by persuading people who some people who are uncomfortable with abortion or even personally opposed that politician shouldn't get to make that choice for people and look now we have an 81-year-old Catholic eye as president who's never been a... personal fan of abortion, but opened his state of the union by promising to stake his political capital on guaranteeing access to abortion nationwide. And to do that, he's going to need to convince people who feel the same way he does. And that is just democracy, that is how we accumulate the power necessary to make sure that we don't just have a president who says the word abortion, but a president the ability and the power to actually make abortion legal in every single state of the country.
