  "text": "But this point, our Christmas meeting has this positive attitude. Just frankly, facts will not be possible. What am I talking about from talking about man in this nature? One boys story. Every weekend, 17-year-old Christmas meeting raids up into needy bodies along with shop, wooden confapsion, and nylon sandbags and who proceeds to fill 20 sandbags, 50 pounds each. One. I think. I'm going to the sandbag holder and I tied the top sandbag and I carry it over to the sandbag wall and stack it or it needs to be stacked and that's about it. I mean it's not a whole lot to it. During this work full day, Chris made a 5-p2 sandbag wall. It's not much. This building is what on the end strip piece. strip, it's barely wide enough to stand on, and Mason next state part in Virginia. The shorter is eroding at the rate of 2 feet a year, so fast that the ground is collapsed underneath the trees and the edge of the beach. For half a mile, this huge 60 and 70 foot trees have toppled over into the water one after another, because the ground putting it upright is gone, it's complete devastation. And there, in the middle of it, this crisis tiny sandbag wall. You have a name for this wall. Yeah, it's the sandbag law. He's been at it for a month and a half, and it's just a correction of what it needs to be. He's trying to pick this one small stretch of beach with his cap, this half way that's about to be eroded out of existence. As well as just 30 feet long, and that's probably, I don't know, third or maybe a fourth of what it needs to be. And... ...crisis definitely. That's December 19th. That's my team. First, Chris is doing this project. It's one of the requirements to become an eagle scout. This fear. By the time he finishes the sandbag wall, he will be too old to be a scout. Much turn 18. You're out of scouting. You must be good. Best friends. Have fun. Well, slightly yum. Usually I'm frustrated when the friends at noon for a while they tell me to help out but they don't always show up but that's that's I understand and it's things that rather do on Saturday than doing Eagle Project won't but it is my Eagle Project and no one else is looking out there Keep it with this story so if  just get a big mission in your head we're just gonna make it happen no matter what. Right. Well yeah, Christopher Columbus was one of them. . So yeah, I've heard a lot of this. I'm pretty sure, , I'm one of those people. I can do this. Do you feel  this is one of those things? Yeah, yeah. Well, not as big as those. It's just diagonal length. Now, whatever I set my mind to, I'm definitely capable of doing. And I know I can do it. I'm Cal. Yeah. Who said this to me over and over a different ways? And I have to say it's an outsider. Unless he gets his entire boy scout troop in there helping out, it is really hard to see how he's confused as well. But when you're up against nature, trying to do something so... much bigger than you are. What does it mean you say? So positive attitudes 90% of it right there. I  to think I'm pretty positive about this. 90% of it's already done. The worst is already behind me and it only gets better from here. You let down Dude bounce You said you were so confident you sure are saying it a lot. Well I always have to tell myself these things because sometimes they get unsure. And if I were letting you down in my head it will just multiply. It doesn't die. It will just multiply. And we keep that out of my head. I just have to keep on saying the right thing. , oh yeah, you're almost done. Welcome to WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International. It's a American life my request. Today on our program, people competing with nature in contest they might not win. Act 1, running at your analogue. We have the latest installment in Scott Carrier's 12 year quest to chase and catch an animal that runs 40 miles an hour. I quit. Act 2, children derail and network television show. The true story of how 208 euros. of the most controlled settings known to man. A late night network touch-up in this case, Tonno de Barriance. Stay with us. At one. Burning up your analog. The human's diminutive of anager is so complete the most of us never get into a competition where we cannot come out on top. Let's go, Pair. story about somebody trying to do something that seems on its face impossible and about why he'd want to and about how he tried to keep positive attitude. It's also partly a story about how humans became humans, but the moment that we became IP of this moment that we stood upright on two feet and separated from the apes. For 12 years, Scott wanted to prove that we stood on two feet as a species, to mine. 1963. The hunt begins at dawn. My brother pulling me out of bed onto the floor. Come on, come on. I'm tired of my shoes and he's out the door. Outside the fog is missing after grass. I'm looking for my brother, but I can't even see the car in the driveway. Then he comes running from the back yard. I jumped and ran and catch up with him across the street and the manneders back yard. And he says, some sheep sleep in the daytime. And go out to night to eat. If we hurry, we can catch them before they go back. back in the ground. I believe it, I have no idea how he knows these things, but he does. He goes out and runs to our neighbor's yards and catches wild animals with his bare hands, meaning lizards, turtles and snakes. He wraps them in his shirt and brings them back and engages in our basement so he can study them for science. He's seven years old, I am six. her running around behind it, and when I lose him in the fog, I followed the tracks he leaves him to do on the grass. I catch up to him, and he's down in his hands and knees crawling through the chinopopocious in front of the Gucci's house. He says, there's a guard snake in there, I saw it, right in front of me. He's crawling around, breaking branches, and I hear the front door open, and there's our neighbor, Daisy Gucci, and her bathroom. She looks 10 feet tall, and 900 years old, and says, what's going on out here? I said, There's a snake in the bush. She says, there's no snake in my bush. You boys get out of pain now. She starts for us with a broom. We take off from. We don't need to run that far. It's not  she's going to come after us, but we keep running anyway. We jump the fence at Fingerholt's house and we're on the golf course, heading toward the going. My brother says, I think I figured out a way to run and not get tired. It's all and how you breathe. Yes, she may have ran over the going down the... the river and back and I didn't get out of breath. I think I can run as far as I want. the Indians, I said, yeah,  the Indians. We have everything we need. The wilderness is unfolding in front of us. 1982. My brothers and master's student in the biology department at the University of If you talk, and he works in Dr. Dennis Bramble's laboratory, in the basement of the building, he's asked me to help him with an experiment. He shows me the inside of the lab's freezer full of dead animals. Road kill, he's picked up, and ranimal sees how to kill himself for science. He's studying to be a vertebrate or a phologist. For the experiment we walk over to the football stadium, which is empty except for us. He passes a styrofoam cup over my mouth. The cup has a wireless microphone. He straps another microphone to my right ankle. Then he says, okay, run around the track run a mile I run poor laps and it's not easy. I'm at a shape and smoking too much It tell my brother I'm sorry, and he says that's okay. That's why I asked you we need data from bad runners Ask him what he's doing and he says we Then is tonight or studying how animals breathe when they run who quadruped scala animals  horses and dogs and cats, they have to inhale every time they stretch out and they strike in the next day when they come forward with their back legs. It's because of the way their diaphragm is connected to their backbone, but in humans, our diaphragms don't have that connection, and we can breathe in whatever pattern we want to or need to. So why is that important for interest to you and say? He says, humans are really good endurance runners. I know I can outrun the dog and I think I can maybe outrun a horse. on a hot day. So for some reason we've evolved this way and maybe the way we breathe might have something to do with it. Why can we run farther than just about any other animal? Well, how do you explain by ask? And he says, I think by peopleism might be an adaptation for endurance running and that maybe our earliest ancestors could run down big game without using any weapons at all. I found ethnographic accounts of primitive people who are able to do it. who are in Mexico, could run down deer. The average in East Australia could run down Kingaroo, the ghost shoots, the Navajo here in the west, and said, do I have been able to run down Ponghorn Antelope? I tried it last summer, and this is an Antelope in my own, just for an hour or so. And they basically ditch me. But I want to try it again. I could use some help if you want to do it. I say, you want to try to run down and Antelope? And he says, I don't know what we can, but I think we should try it. 1984. In the summer, my brother and I go to Wyoming to try to run down the analog. The idea is not to run faster than the analog. Only cheese can run faster than the Honghorn analog, but to run longer and farther and heat of the day. My brother thinks it will take about two hours, and then the analog will overheat and collapse. If you drive off the interstate and down the dirt road for a few miles. and it's a wide and open high-desitable sagebrush, drizzable mountains and every direction and their analog everywhere. Compares and clusters and families by themselves. He stopped the car and started running after three, a buck and two doves. They run very quickly but for short distances, and then stop and stare at us until we catch up and then we take off again. Sometimes they run a quarter of a mile, sometimes a half mile. My brother is a much better runner than I am, and I'm way behind looking out the sagebrush and rattlesnakes and cactus, tired already, but laughing. It's a lot of fun, a lot more fun than running down the street, or even up in the mountains. I keep my brother in sight, and although I sometimes lose the envelope, I can tell the running is broad art clockwise, and so I aim to cut them off and it works. I catch up with them, even ahead of my brother, and they stand there, and let me get with him 50 yards of glue. I don't have big black eyes. Eyes, the size you'd see in the horse. They look at me  they know exactly what I'm proposing from the knot and least bit worried. They look at me and I stare back and this goes on for maybe a couple minutes. I don't know. I can't say because something happens. It's  being hit the ties or  being abducted by aliens who take me to another planet or what they do things to me that can't remember. Because they bring me back to the exact... same place, and only a few seconds of the laughs. Then, suddenly, the envelopes jerk and fly off running. They turn and see my brother coming up already and sweating. He chased them over another little hill, and on the other side, they're now eight of them. So we followed the eight for a little ways, and then they split into three groups that all go in different directions. He can't tell which group has even one of the envelopes you started chasing. They all look so much alike, especially from the distance. So we choose two dogs and follow. and they run over another little hill and on the other side all of a sudden there are 20 of them running as a herd. Following this herd is  following the school of fish, they blend in flow and change positions. There are no individuals but a mass that moves across the desert  a pool of mercury on a glass table. They split again, burst into five pieces and it's just too confusing. We can't tell whether we're chasing out. to run for two minutes or 20 minutes for two hours. I catch up with my brother and he says, man, you see him run? They just zoom in that gun. I ask him how we're going to get around how they group up and split  that. And he says, I don't know. I've been thinking about it and I don't know. What do you think we should do? I ask him and he says, I think we should try again. Let's go find some more. And so we did, we chased them on and off for two minutes. But basically they just ditch us every time. My brother is calling away to get a PhD at a big university back east. The campus is flat surrounded by trees. They no longer thinks about chasing hell low. He studies lizards now. I stand Salt Lake, pacing my life by changing traffic lights, the blinking turn signals, bouncing checks. I have no desire to participate in the market economy or the democratic process. I have no goals or ambitions, other than to someday go back to the desert with my brother and try again to run down an analog. I have a plant and I'm trying to follow it, but it's hard, it's a hard plant to follow. I'm trying to get a shape, trying to lift. a primitive man. Sometimes I feel  I'm not succeeding at either one. I've had a lot about primitive cultures and I use that term primitive in the sense that it means original or primary. From maybe 99% of human history or few million years humans were hunters. They didn't get up and go to work each morning. That started with civilization, and civilization is nothing but a heartbeat of recent time, 10,000 years of the most, the hell with that. I want to... I wake up naked alone in the desert, on each sand, drink piss, and pass out screaming from some burn and spider bites. But I know it won't work, and I know it won't happen. Either because I'm a coward or an eagle, or it's just not possible at all for anyone. Even if I were to wake up naked and alone in the wilderness, I'd still wake up thinking and making sense of myself in the world around me and modern English, and there's no way I can get around there. I don't stop with choosing not to participate. of a part in any way I can think of. My life is to  it. I think maybe that's why she wanted to marry me. But now we have kids and she sort of changed her mind. I try to get in shape by running in the mountains and skiing across country. I smoke marijuana and eat LSD and go out and try to go farther and farther and at best eventually. get lost and deeply humbled and almost died trying to make it back. This is my training. And at times, I thought I'd be pretty cool when I'm out there. I feel  I've made the right choice and then I'm learning a lot and getting stronger. But most of the time, I'm not out there. Most of the time I'm down in the city, slavening away and feeling depressed. Perhaps my best success so far is realizing that I can get lost and almost die without leaving home and that the best test of endurance is just... or cysts, or rather to incest from day to day, and believing that it is possible to run down the analog and that it must be done, and that I and the one who must do it. 1992 I read everything I can find in the University Library that's been written on which really is an all that much. There is still somewhat mysterious and unknown animals even for the scientists who study them. According to Stan Lindstedt, the biologist living in Flagstaff, Arizona, the pronghorn or the best endurance athletes in the world. They metabolize oxygen at a rate three and a half times high and even the finest human runners. They have twice as much blood and their hearts and lungs are three times the size of the mammal of comparable weight. They can run the equivalent of a marathon 40 minutes. It can easily... maintained a speed of 40 miles an hour from more than 60 minutes. They had nobody fat whatsoever. In 1850 there were 60 million out of open North America, but they were nearly wiped out along the buffalo. They're about a million left today. They said to have 10X vision, which means that on a clear night they can see the rings of Saturn. They made me sagebrush, but also rabbit brush, salt sage, winter fat, for-wing flat brush. The fireweeds summer cycles. We try and learn with these plants a look . 1993 I found an old ethnography dated 1935 on the tar of Mar, one of the tribes my brother said can run down big game. And he's right. It seems that they at least used to do. This is a passage from the book. The tar of my keep the deer constantly on the move. Only occasionally does he get a glimpse of his core, but follows it unarrowing through his own candy ability to read the tracks. The Indian chases the deer until the creature falls from exhaustion, often with its hooves completely worn away. It stems ruddled by the man, or killed by the dog. But then, of course, this was written by a couple of anthropologists who didn't actually go out to hunt the Indians, and so the report is basically here saying, it's no way to... know what it's actually true. There seems to be no doubt that the tar who are crazy about running. Another afternoon of death found describes these races they have, where a group of men from a village, eat pay-o-de and smear themselves with white grease, and run as a team tossing leather ball the size of hacky sack, down trail with the toes. They run for three days, close to 300 months, and the winning team gets to sleep with all the available women with a lot of leverage. This is the way I want to. 1991. My brother spent five years in Ann Arbor, Michigan, trying to get a PhD. And it seems  the whole thing is killing. He's developed a hard condition, probably in particular, for evaluation, which means that the upper and lower chambers beat us simply chatted. This blood doesn't circulate. It happens only for... surgery and it happens only when it's really tired or extremely tense and nervous. when he runs the floor, right before he has to defend his dissertation, he suddenly could use he has to sit down, sometimes he passes out. I've written a letter to his advisor and I've come to Hanok to handle him. Dear Dr. Render, I assume that you're aware of my brother's heart condition, you probably even believe you understand the pathology involved. Maybe perfectly clear. My brother. dies while under your supervision, you can kiss your own sweet-ass goodbye. I drive into town in the Sunday night and adores to the biology building law. I've been here a couple of times before and I sort of remember when my brother's lab is located. So I take a guess until a rock at a window and it's his and his lab on a table is a three-foot monitor lizard lying perfectly stiff. except for an occasion with Blink of an eye. Too tiny why is the dangling out of its rib cage. He's anesthetized and implying that electrodes into its inner cost of muscles, muscles along the rib cage. He puts the lizard in his box and takes him to the basement where he's built along runway, plywood, and two-by-fours. He has another lizard down there, and he takes it out of the cage and holds it puts it on his shoulder, and it jumps from there through three feet of air, and lands on the wall sticks to the inner block  spider neck. He ached it off the wall and put it at one end of the runny. Watch how it's backbone moves when it runs. He said, if any touches its tail can blast off down the track. It's backbone waves  a plucked guitar string. My brother says, I thought that lizards probably can't breathe when they run, but the way they bend  that would make it impossible. And do they ask? Nope. Looks  they can't run and breathe at the same time. So why is it taking you so long? Why have you been doing this for five years? He says he's upset some people, some dinosaur people. He says he's happy to go back and do all of his experiments all over the weekend. I ask him why the dinosaur people are upset and he tells me, but I don't understand what it is. I tell him I'm going to Mexico to run down a deer with a tar in the mark. The town could be  science to actually record how they do it. That would be the first and only record the first hand experience. And so he says there's no way he can go. No way can leave his work. He doesn't even seem interested. And I drive out of town without delivering the letter and thinking, Now it's just me. Now I'm in this alone. It's got to carry your heads to Mexico, trying to find out the envelopes with native peoples there in a minute. And pop up video international. Why not open to this? This is American Life in my last seat, we're going to program this scene from the beginning of the stairs. I'll program today, people who do that on nature, who are possibly at this. We return to Statenary Street, I'll just go up your quest for me. 1994, I'm always ready to go. I have a map, never remember I was. I have an English star from my dictionary that I keep checking out from the University ingo linear driver. I'm ready. If I can only get the money and if I can only get the time, but I never do and it never happens. Now all of a sudden the tarimara comes to salt rate and our staying in my house. Therefore, men between 25 and 35 years old and they're here to run in a hundred mile race through the Wastatch Mountains. I'm in the process of tearing the house apart, I call it, and there's no electricity because I'm redoing the service in that way. You don't even have a wire from the pole, but this is a good thing. think something that will make the tar humara feel at home, they don't have electricity, they only have outhouses. The manager is a back country tour guide from Tucson, Arizona. He tells me his brother who had raised money and get media attention for their families back home, where all started in the day. The tar humara are wearing their traditional clothing along white shirts, out of the waist back, out, and pair of sandals cut from his truck tires. They appear to be healthy enough, but I can't really tap. This sign. They look mainly at the ground and they move around my house as a unit, even at the bathroom. They look more frightened than I'm learning. We enter outside where they see more comfortable and afterwards I asked them through a friend who speaks Spanish if they've ever run down a deep. And they say, no, they're disappeared and they don't know why, but they're gone. Pass them if they know why. other old retired Marl who did do it and they say yes they know it was done they heard stories and that the technique was to chase them for two or three days taking turns and trading off and even sleeping and tracking them down to start again in the morning eventually the day would stop and let them put a rope around its neck and then they'd kill it. Two days later three of the four retired Marl finished first second fourth in the race all running 100 miles up and down. to the mountains in less than 21 hours. 19. 95. When I drive across the desert, I look for an all-op stand by the highway. One time, on my 80s, my homie, I saw three of them out around the freight train. On November 3th, north-western Nevada they were at East Pippoff Middle-Reven, the midnight middle of the East Alabama Defense Administration Sunday 7 December,right后 Winter, when Lord Water delivered. In the Δone secure an慘ene and Meeting. At the Lyd Damn, the low time, where flooding rose, the most風 energy, the most outroof, the evidently tremendous amount of rising yearning among other conditions. cuddle, there have been more than 2100 grows wzing when their sustainable properties vary. for running alongside my tie. If you out ahead and cross the road  a river flowing 60 miles an hour, again in my own evening night, I saw what looked  the cluster of luminous engraves along the road, and then realized that it was animal bodies, whoop of them, hanging out and watching the traffic  a driving moving. And then in the great Salt Lake Desert I saw a lone male stand motionless in the staring while 4 of 16 fighter jets flew over the tent and then waited the bomb hit. I've been watching that lone male for a couple of years now. He's part of a small herd, maybe 12 to 16. I can always find a place called Puddle Valley, and no marins land just swest of the great salt lake, just east of the Bonneville soft flats, just south of the hill at four space farming range, and just north of the dugway proving ground, where the army has biological and chemical weapons. As one paved road that runs up the valley, and they are open nearly always standing alongside the road, but not right on the asphalt itself. The walk slowly away if I stop and get out of the car, but otherwise they just stand there and look at me when they are dirty on its way. I've been thinking that this herd would be a lot easier for Chase because they are so few of them. And then I've been watching the long nail on hopped, I think I could recognize in a distance case it tried to group up and split by one step before. His horns are more shaped  a heart than the others and he has a brown line on his chest grows around  a question mark. I call him a lone male. He's the only seeing ones with the others And this was in the fall when he was writing with two goats going from one to the other with a hard arm kicking up dirt pissing the sh** marking plants with the sink-bring his teeth Once really spring I saw him through my binoculars from half mile away He was looking right back at so I melt down little clip. So my head was just below his line of sight. I waited for 10 minutes or so, and then stood up slowly with Pete. He was standing there looking at me. But much closer, maybe only a quarter of him ran away. So I sat down and waited some more. They came to with that 100 yards. So I laid flat and weighed and I could hear him in the sagebrush, barking me  a shark cock. He came real close. Less than 30 yards away. And I stood up. up and he didn't take on. Just stood there and bark at me, scratched the dirt with his front wing, then slowly worn it up. There are two dominant theories of human evolution, and neither theory involves running. Both theories basically say that humans stood upright, so they'd be able to use their hands to pick stuff up. tools or weapons or food or infants. There's probably some truth in that idea, but I just can't believe that it's a whole story. I can't believe that running is a part of it. For one thing, tools don't show up in the archaeological records until two million years after homies first walked up right. If my brother's right, one of the reasons hominets stood upright. One of the reasons human separated from heaps and became human is that standing upright gave him more endurance and more endurance as well. run for chasing game. This seems true to me at a basic level that's how I'm doing to explain. When my brother and I were out chasing how I was, it felt different, more fundamental than anything I'd ever done. I felt connected and a whole, as if I had nothing, nothing is everything I need. 16 2017. Heck of two years. passing paperbacking for the 3D IRS, I formed a nonprofit corporation to raise money for a trip to visit the Seri Indian in Mexico. The Seri's live-on and near-Tibro and I was in the C4Test, just inside the Baja Peninsula. Unlike the Tar Humaar, they said to have been able to run down dear. But the Seri's are said to be even more wild and more inclusive and more ineffective by civil authorization. A real purpose for the expedition and send it out to a lot of foundation. government agencies and that one was fine. But now the American Express Company out of the blue has given me a corporate gold car with no apparent credit winner. So we're leaving. In two months someone from the American Express Company will call and fire about a payment before two months is such a long time. The inconceivable car in the driving south into the Sinole and further developed. welcome. A little black for my brother to come along and he's just been hired by the University of Utah as a professor in the biology department. He came to town five dogs, 15 surgeon fish, four five food alligators and two agwants and he's busy setting up his laboratory and preparing his lectures. So I've asked my friend, Pray and King to come and split. Pray and subest runner I know. He's 43 years old, probably passed his part, but a decade or two. who was a virtual wonder of a low-bick capacity during running and skiing, collapsing all previous notions of priming and space in Rocky Mountain. For instance, once ran back and forth across the Grand Canyon in the South room, down to the river, and up to the North room and back, distance 42 miles, with more than 22,000 feet of elevation in seven and a half hours. I've always thought if anybody could catch an arrow, it'd be crazy. Üvaso Br liking to sendo. because they're out of school for the summer and holding up now 9-11. They come along for the adventure. It's a long drive down there, 1000 miles, and it's hot and clean. The two sun, hotter stills across the boarding to Mexico. You drive into her and see her on the west of the ocean. It's simply the hottest place I could ever imagine. Police are having a good time to do. I keep picking them at my tires and my radiators and I'm blowing up at my car which has over 250,000 miles on it. It's just not gonna make it. We're gonna be stuck in the middle of a dozen. I keep picking, I've made a big mistake. So I spent 12 years being obsessed with a foolish notion that I pushed it to the point of absurdity and now we're all going to pay for it. Big time. The crating seems to be that way. and I'm a kid's oblivious to everything that the heat and the strange desert. Sun-baid and full of sub-weir on some ways of cacti holding big ice cream at. Girl having good current and I try to relax and let things have that cooking out. There's a small fishing village called Pinta Chewake, composed of the sea of protest with about 200 people all-series. They live in Cinderblock rooms committed by it in Baby Blue with the doorless window either open or missing off together. And the yard is separated by fences made from branches and sticks and worn out fishing nerves. We drive slowly through the houses, stop at the beach. Five or six women come around us and start speaking to us in seren. Trying to sell us some necks to make them. and brightly-creditshells, beautiful dark red iron with sculptures of dolphins, sea turtles, and guants. We buy a few of these, but they clearly want us to buy them off. We tell them later, maybe later, that we don't have a lot of news, that they're adding, putting things in our hands, poking us in the ribs, making it clear we have no use of value to them, other than us. After what seems  quite a long time, we're going to have a lot of fun. After what seems  quite a long time. time where sort of rescue from the women by a man who comes over and introduces himself as a nesto moline fishermen and a tourist guy. This 50 years old and speaks excellent spanish. It's very calm and soft spoke. The nice change from the women. This is his been the college and press career asana. And he tried talking to him in English and he understands but he always answers and spans. He told him that we've come because we're interested in learning about how to the Syrian and beer. I would  to find something to take us over to the ice. He says no one lives on the island anymore, that the Mexican government has turned it into a national heart, but he can take us over to visit. And as far as hunting goes, the Mexican government also prohibits that, but that he's well acquainted with the old ways, as he's the grandson of Francisco Molina, guide to the great Charles Shelton, the American hunter who visited the Serium 1921. I've read Shelton's account and beat him up to book along with me, and I get it out of the car and this though shows me the photograph. the grass in his grandfather and sister. His red book knows the passages where children described how impressed he was with the ancestors knowledge and strength of the hunter. From a maze by a rock, we've been here for less than an hour and already we found the next little guy in the country. The meaning is. More than once. More than once. More than once. More than once. You are in the textbook. Three years ago we were almost extinct. La persona, Colvénis, La Colvénis. In the evening we sit with Ernesto and Naviche, and he tells us they, yes, it's true. The series of one time before they had arrived. But run after deer until they dropped from Zosti. The young hunter will be given a special dream to a three types of plants who would say which one. But it was a power proof, sometimes, to give it a strength and fortune. And then the hunter will go off and track the deer alone. Once he found the deer, he would start running after. in a series of chases. In the first chase, the deer would be frightened but run very quickly and far away. And a third-grade skill and knowledge to follow. Never losing sight of the animal. Making sure you still follow the same animal and that this was critical and very difficult. To make sure it was always followed in the same one. Eventually the hunter would catch up with the deer and run again. This time we're slowly in the last of the distance. One or two or three kilometers. And again, the hunter must make sure that he did not lose. side of it and that it was the same image. The deal would stop again the rest and the 100 would catch up with it and this time the third time the deal would realize that the 100 was stronger and the deal would become the story because although the deal is very smart that's a half real power to the human being. Eventually the deal would be completely fatigue being down and sometimes it would fall, knock it up, sometimes the 100 would kill the rock. This was the method to set the technique that was used. and as well. We asked him if he's ever done this, hunted this thing, and it says no, that his grandfather Francisco could do it, but then when he does, the technique got into it. We asked him how he knows for sure that it was done this. He says that both his father and his grandfather told him about it, and that they were both great hunters and knew very well the ways of the truth. But that now there are much fewer of you than that, again, the government doesn't allow them to hunt. He says that there are two elders in the world. Montana's brothers who also know about it and that was talked about mom actually . There's a lot of health care, there's Mary, although her big words were that hot. The next day we interviewed Queen and she made Montana. They say they're about 64 and 70 years old, but they don't know for sure. It's neither one can remember the month or a year they were born. They speak and say translated by Queen Sun. They tell us basically the same story as the next one. that the hundred were chased the deer three or four times and we take about two and a half hours and then a deer would collapse. Creating an accident if there are any runnin' in the world, anyone would  to try this again here and they say no, but they no longer run that everything is changed. Ask them if it's better and please says no, not a lot, it was better before that they used to do everything as a fan that the whole community was a fan and that they shared everything in cooperation. But now there's a lot of argument, picking more  every man from the south. In the morning and in the snow comes by our camp on the beach with his boat ready to take us across the channel to Timberman. Takes about an hour to get there. The land had lunch and then created my love our water bottles, had out the mountains for looking to do it, leaving the kids with me. We run and walk and meet back and forth through the vegetation, which is all nearly weak for some form, and not there's nothing much of shade for protection from the sun. It's so hot and bright and dry. It's hard to believe anything and anybody can survive it more than a few hours. We run and walk in our mid-and-a-rounder side, seeing deer traps and deer scat, but no deer. After a few miles we get to the footman and climb a small peak when we about five hundred feet high. Knock up. to the top of the note, right 2003, higher, maybe 10 miles in distance, dark red, and ragged volcanic rock, completely bare and forbidden,  pictures and back remarks. We talked about maybe trying to climb, but now it's clear we've never made it the key to the dood. Coming up with here, we both got stabbed, shins by cacta, crating that so bad, but my legs on. lmao! topple! hard to run, they are on the collapsed. All you had to do is a stiff. Squills are  a porcupine. A couple of inches long into the bar. It makes a new deep and deeper. I start pulling them out and gloves running down in my socks. The skin is swelling up with hot, and I'm a bit biograph. As we're sitting there, we realize that just next to us is a small clear-down circle. Ring by a low wall of rock. I'm up in the room, but maybe it's a campsite. And there's some broken pieces of pottery really thin with the ink from the John Bukeri water. You can see out across the channel for mainly in the north and south, maybe 100 miles. Perfect place to sit and wait for inspiration. We sit in silence for a while and I'm trying to believe that we're doing the right thing that we're doing what we've come here for, but really honestly I want to go back the idea. Let's drive home. No fun. hot and burnings of oil and I don't care about hunting anymore. Coming down here, I was thinking that maybe the series were still  they used to be, and that maybe we could find the last surviving wilden around the planet, but that was foolish, just a dream or a delusion. And I've just woke him up and the whole thing was disappearing, front of me. There are no more primitive patterns left anyway. It's a dead thing. Surviving only is a story in a few old people's heads. In one their gone will be gone. Moss forever. It now seems ridiculous to try to run down that on earth. I tell Crayon that maybe this is it that this is as far as we should go. That's time to go home. He agrees. We start back. 19, 1997. On Sunday, in July, I'm eating dinner at my mother's house in Salt Lake, and I mentioned to my brother that, Prady and I are going after the desert, west of the late next week, to try chasing hell over the day. I tell him Prady was inspired by the series that he's been running a lot since we got back, and I feel  I've played if I didn't go with him, just go out one more time, try it. I tell my brother this, without any conviction, without expecting him to be interest. Dr. Myst Pray. He isn't to us. He says he wants to go. He had other plans for the changing. He even seems hurt. I wouldn't think about him, but he- And I said, yeah, okay, good. Let's do it. Does he make any sense of... It does start off in that time, huh? Yeah,  a-  a-  a-  a net. So everybody stuff is the same place. Yeah, and we are 5 of- my brother, Peyton, myself, and our friends, Calvin and Bryan, we were also excellent runners. We can't have any hillside overlooking the valley. Why? and miles and bayonets, not a tree in sight, is bring by Mount's maybe 1500 feet tall. It's still a clock, 100 degrees, and we're trying to decide on a strategy. Don't we want to head him towards that little mountain? I think we should try to head him. You're going to be good, man. Yeah, because they're a max duo too. Pretend I know how the seri chase dude. They told us, but now, now that we're used to the information, we need him on our best brings it up. Somehow, that's the scene too. fly. But we end up doing this. We drive down a road in two clouds and find the lone man standing on 30 feet off the road. We drive by  we're not interested. Stop by the mile away and get out and argue some more about how we're gonna do that. Then we get back in the cars and drive back to the lone man and stop on opposite side to the bird and then pile out of the cars and start chasing. It runs due west and we spread out the long line. It keeps going again. because cranes are much faster running than any. My brother stays behind it and I start running more hoping that the analog turn clockwise and I'll be able to play more. I run and sometimes stop and look and see the analog cranes in my brother. Still going wet. I run and stop and don't see anything. I take out my dinner. The same power looking at the ellipse and search around and find the sea of white spot. Go and not. It's quite asked if you are not letting pass. Just a white spot swimming through the rocks either love the sagebrush as can to the south See great small eat it. You pursue farther behind another be my brother They're heading north so I turn east run about a half out and I come back to the hiding Stop looking out see my truck to my hometown road no analog No people I stand there for a little while. Hey, what do you want to do? And then I just see It jumps off the road and down into a sandwall. Just see its atmosphere and white hair. The animal. It started after realizing that the others are far away and it's up to me. The animal is run from almost an hour and covered maybe 20 miles and 100 degree feet. I've run maybe a quarter of this distance and I have water on my back that I've been drinking for. If there is any human advantage to write for my brother, if I can maybe, I should certainly have it in the moment. This is the moment I can make it go. got both exhilarates and sick and sick. I learned thinking this is it. He did just what I thought he would. This is the whole thing right now and I left. I left and right and it is for sure the best thing I've ever done. I have everything I need. The wilderness is unfold and fun. Speak, Ethereum, Cons360. O, theagom. Oh! Oh lo. In the area there are 4 coins. Oh, come on! All... I'm getting forwarding down I'm getting forwarding down I'm getting forwarding down Oh, now you're always in our way of talking Oh, now you're all Oh, do let your guard down Don't live forever Oh, now you're always in my way of talking Oh, now you're always in my way of talking That too, natural disaster. Now the story of two men battling the forces of nature in one of the most antiseptic and photembrion means possible, studio for late night pop show. On August 8th, show late night with Conan Abarion, but that's what I consider in the event, the single most interesting hour of evolution this year. It was daring, less ended, was in experiment. there's studio audience with eight euros. And it got so chaotic that it times kind of in a brand literally had to tell the audience to pay attention to what was happening on stage. A typical moment in the show, kind of a tell-a-very adult joke, kind of a normal top show, man-hunter, or J, or a economy. And then you can pause it, and you can just leave it with it. It's television because nobody even in room knew what he was talking about. And then you can just pause it, and then I guess it'll pause it. off somewhere and then the kids would scream and they would clap. It was almost  a critique of a pop show. And then if you're at a bunch of regular notebooks, they would throw in a joke  this. Finally, last thing I'll mention before we get started kids, Barbara Streisand, you all know her from Yanto, right? Yeah. Barbara Streisand has asked the E networks gossip show not to call her babden. That's right, but she does not want to be called babden anymore. Yeah, the only problem. Now they've started calling her poopy head. I thought I could be a ghost. That's just... Andy Richter is the co-host of Late Night with Kennon of Brian, who set on stage out of the Bink through the whole memorable, nearly out of control hour and he says this about poopy. When we're planning, , we're sort of ordering jokes, , putting them in order or little bits of comedy for a sketch. There's no B1 that will feature the words, , dumbass. ass, or burns, or boobs, we'll say, yeah, people laughed that. So it's just, , it's  a children's just a little easier. And it's less sensual. Now Andy, we're putting this interview that I'm doing with you into an episode of our program about people battling natural voices beyond their control. And one thing that I think made this particular hour of television that we've did, such amazing TV is that watching it anyway. I always had the sense that the entire things felt  any moment they could tumble out of control and I wonder is that the way it felt on Sningwich? Probably worse. Probably felt worse. What we made is we had what we called the Board of Monsters which was a noise in H.A.O. The Board of Monsters is coming and then we showed we had a way to take of this big monster that we created coming down as darkness. Darkly glitz hall away. and they can be slowly. He's still here! He's still here! And they had to scream and applaud to get them off through to go away and not come in and get us. Which we thought, well the kid will be frightened of the monster and so that we'll pinch them into screaming and applaud it. Which is just another, , it's another applause  him. But we didn't realize that kids wanted the money shot. They wanted to see that, man. They wanted to come in. So they wouldn't scream? And they, well, they would scream, but we had to introduce the word boring to their lexicon. So after the monster didn't come in, they cared because they wanted to help by cheering and that's what they'd been asked to do. They keep them on speaking. Yeah, but, but then when it didn't come in, they were kind of mad and they started chanting, boring, boring. And on stage  what are you thinking at that point? Well, I was seriously thinking just doing large crack walls Right, I would do anything I can yes, exactly. I would  hold down my pants and dance Especially when it's with children you think what are they ? If they had allowed me to defecate I'd probably Right there's you point where you guys have Dave Holy from that and I climbed this. It's 29 seconds before it erupts into complete chaos. Hmm. Wait this for you. Oh man, what were the show? Oh, I think you're gonna hide. Oh, let's just say that's Dave Holy is usually. Guys, this is where we go hide Dave. Hi. It's nice isn't it? It's a nice stage in place. Yeah, it is. Well, for you, you don't have kids. Oh, you have to. Yeah. So this is your help for you. It's just  being home. Yeah because I have actually 150 children. All right. Now, hey kids that don't know, we're gonna talk to Dave Bowley for a bit. It's not gonna take very long. No. Right? Now first of all, we're gonna do. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just didn't use the slide. Wait, I did. I went to Africa. I flew to Zimbabwe. Africa. And flew into horror, and then when I was just finished. I mean, did you anticipate it? It was intense. who's going to call a part of that fast? No, no. And I felt terrible today. It just sort of... It's humiliating. , it's humiliating. Yeah, it has a much rationalization as you can do and say, well, they're just children. And they don't really know who I am. It's still you've got about 700 to 700 human beings screaming at you. All ring when you're a performer. So it's your job to be interesting. So I felt I felt terrible. And actually there was I think there's an edit taken out of there Where I think home and got actually a little real with the chill dress But what did he do? What did he say? Is that hey come on? Cloth it down something  that. I just had it was  a really tough performance moment for Kona And you just have no I just seemed  he had entered into this territory where he had no idea what would be the right thing and the wrong thing. There were no guides, there's no experience to back him up. No, as the only experience in that instance would be great school teacher would be good. This is, I have to say, I mean, this is the most interesting hour TV I've seen in the, I don't know how long. Thank you. Did you guys view it as, Seth? I don't think so. It's so, it was so hard to think of it as anything, but a, but a dream, right? Just because. it felt so uncomfortable and felt so draining. I think that afterwards we just read such a science, we felt so exhausted that it was hard to believe that it was. Good. Since you were in the grip of the force, more powerful than you were. Absolutely. Absolutely. I thought that just imagined it, getting to a gym.
