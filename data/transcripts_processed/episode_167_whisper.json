As a human civilization suddenly got a global term paper dead on. We had to get everything down for the semester that was the last century ended. There would be points taken off of papers. And during this odd period of human beings thinking about past and horizon future, the New York bites match-the-功s special-ish. summarized behavior, which is going to vary time capsule for the people of the year 2000. And among the dozens of people who they invited to take part in, is the Cardi-Guide Finder, and it now makes films.

The turns out, just the night report, Ben and his dinner up. party were he had met Scottie just door, really funny smart guy who was a professional actor and he wore this very time-tip. Benince just into the near pops up he would make a very brief move where he would take the Skyrim streets to film him alone and guide we look to wrecking into the tower to something along the lines and hello people with future. Scientists tell us about the time that you've seen this human kind woke up made. imaginable advances. Gone will be the problems that plague us today. Disease, inequality, pollution, war. By I am told that a thousand years from now, human beings may grow to be as large as fine, perhaps even six feet tall. People of the future, I salute you. And that will be it. And presumably the people of the future would at some point look at the other pages in the magazine buried in this time. So I'm realized that 20 century humans are already reached. Bye. to be in height. And hopefully they would understand the whole thing was a joke. A joke launched deep into the future, which the New York Times did actually prove this, but I have to say I love this idea. Can you imagine what it would be  to get a message that from a thousand years back if we would find little pranks, let first in the ruins of Egypt or Rome or Pompeii we would love this people. Anyway, around this time, what people might actually knew and love were worrying about the civilization of the future and what do we think of us? They came up with what I realized. I hate the people of the future. I don't care what they do to us. Picture, they are a thousand years from now. The people of the future, not only are we those, but our children come, our children's Everything we ever believed or cared about, it is long, long forgotten. And there they are, the people of the future. busy with the busy lives, driving the work, making plans for the weekend, getting together. There, I hate them. I mean, I don't hate them, but they can spend themselves. And they don't care what we were , not in a big way. And here's the winner. Name and people from the 15th century. Lots of people are first thing differently than I did, comes to the people of the future. And they have their work cut out for them. Worry about their legacy, or will people think of them, and they're trying to set the record straight. They have the subject today's radio program.

We're being with three stories in three separate acts. Act one, do we decimal beats, Truman? Brooklyn is building a presidential library from a memorialized and suffered people of the UNO win. Around contributing editor Sarah Vow towards the libraries or dead presidents come up with suggestions and tips for how we should handle the job. Act two, one in one, don't make two. I'm going to hear this. of somebody who, for an accident of history, became obsessed with how the future would view her, Margaret Oswald, the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald. We have rare audio recordings of her from the 1960s that have never been played publicly. Act 3. You don't have to be a nine-stime. Mike Patternity was in with the story that begins with Einstein's brain, preserved for the people of the future, and ends in a karaoke bar. Stay with us. If somebody is straight up to hero, the question of his legacy is just not that interesting. It's the plot, the imperfect, but I have to think hard about how to this present itself. Which is why the question of a Clinton presidential library is such an interesting one. Sarah Vowl has taken into the pond herself to offer some advice to the president, how the hand of the job. Memo, two president William Jefferson Clinton. from Citizen Sarah Jane Ball, R.E. Presidential Library's back findings who work. Mr. President, I'm tired. Who wouldn't be after eight long years of sticking up for you? 60% of the American public still likes the way you do your job. Somehow, I never seem to run into any of these people. So, I'm excited about your impending presidential library in Little Rock. No longer will I be responsible for defending your own. friends, family, and the occasional app driver. What are relief to turn over what's left of my faith and you to some building and art and stuff? But before I relinquish my duties as your crappy little cheerleader, I scoped out for Presidential Library to help you figure out how to do job right. Not that you asked me. I just don't want you to mess this up. Well, begin our tour at the John F. Kennedy Library overlooking Boston Harbor. Partly because your youth and flash have been described as the Kennedy S. And partly because you yourself have often invoked the comparison most notably by trotting out that film of you shaking JFK hand as teenager and image of eerie destiny. I talked to the Kennedy Library curator Frank Rick. We agreed that the- Plain is pleasure of visiting presidential libraries is getting close to the actual stuff of history. We have on display in one of the cases in that room, the little card. And which he's written in his, it's been in Rayalena spelled out phonetically so he is. And if you watch the film, you can see just before he gets to that line, he looks down on the paper. And it looks up and says, it should be in I'm Brilena. And love those little card spawnances. between an artifact and he's a film and the most beautiful one comes towards the end of the museum where we had a video of his choreo violin in 1963 and as he was leaving he quoted a piece of poetry that this is the Lair of the White Prisoner who decided to him in the night before dinner he'd written them down back with his in the film. See him in the film. Pick up a piece of paper and the piece of the mirror. Silver, jug. It's windy. That's why he has it under the... There's blowing around and the wind. Fix it up in any of his sights. This is very beautiful lines. That's because we've changed. We're changing the law. Yes, I'm excited. Years of pain. See you again in the Space Game. Oh Lord, I was glad. I'm gonna put him back and see what he has to do. At the end of the recitation he folds it up and you can see the crease. And again, it's one of those things where you feel as if you're there at that moment in time. Thank you. In this I am paid design. White Box, JFK's life and death unfold primarily on television monitors and video screens. I'm never particularly worshiped Jack Kinnish. I mean, you don't eat really do wish-thing. Step tall. He spoke of civil rights, but it was Clinton Johnson's who got actual laws at. And then there's the minor matter of the dismissal crisis. Perhaps this various single week in the history of the world. and yet as if his library, I found myself hoodwakes by pretty words. No other pre-nation is demanded so much of itself who hot-words and cold, who resistion in front of parents, who the ages of the out of an out of space. The American people have neither fallen, nor is their faith flagged. If at times are actions seem to make life difficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult because of update your value, So you must anticipate those thatший can start filter? I will stop myself, if you want to change direction the way they I'm not sure if you can read all of them. You may notice there are no narrators to our films and our videos that the Principal Voice is out of John and Katie. So, did that very consciously? There are also a lot of pretty pictures. How movies of JFK, handing the Dandelion, and on John, when weirdly evocative film strip of the president in which all he does is carry a briefcase and walk to a car. This is why it's so rippity, he's taking work cold. But I can't resist it. The man is Medusa. Don't look in his eyes. Because it clenic, you should melt this in your library. Where the legislative record is perhaps ambiguous or downright shabbed, go for the flashy sound bite. You're such a sweet talker. The Charlie Parker of the Pespa. to an A, riffing rhythmically about everything from interest rates to grease versus turkey with regards to cypress. Get a couple of great quotes for all little music under them and let's see what a great president is worth. America is far more than a place. It is an idea, the most powerful idea in the history of nations. And all of us in this chamber, we are now the bearers for that idea. We get this all worked out for all of them to be 150. Now people will still fall in love. Old people will still fight about things that should have been resolved 50 years ago. We will all allocate and do stupid things and we will all see the unbelievable capacity of humanity to be known. This is a great day. General Dwight D Eisenhower, a military media on the rise. I think Clinton, I wanted to go to the Dwight David Eisenhower library in Aboline, and look forward to seeing you again in the next video. they handle something your library will have to tackle, which is if one of the achievements of a presidency is economic prosperity, how do you display that without putting out a bunch of toasters and who loves who's without making people seem dumb and materialistic? How do you convey the decent seat of making people's lives better? Unfortunately for our project, the way the Eisenhower library deals with this challenge is they basically ignore it. In fact, you barely know the man was press. The exhibit devoted to his White House years is mostly heaps of weird but swanky gifts he got, a mosaic desk from the shop of Iran. What the museum's great at is Eisenhower's military career. And so I walk around with it's director Dan Holt. I think who cares if he's accomplished anything after being taken. And this is early, similarly, we're going to the original note that Roosevelt and Churchill signed a point of yours in order to speak and her. Spaniard this point in the music I forgot he was pressed. Yeah, right. President Clinton, there is a lesson to be learned here after all, which is life to your strength. I can have a greatest achievement with liberating Europe. Your greatest achievement, balancing the budget. Not as dramatic I know, they're probably... not going to make a Tom Paints movie about fiscal policy no matter how inspired that fiscal policy might be. But still, as the White House webpage cheerfully points out, your money wrangling did create the longest economic expansion in US history and the most new job ever created in a single administration. When the Eisenhower Library, the climax of the visit is G-Day, in which you turn a sharp corner and suddenly you're standing  a soldier on a ship's roof. ramps, facing a normal beach. Then he walks through a small mock-up of the NLCI, landing-craft infantry, and in the photograph it's been called the Jaws of Death, which is the landings of normal beach. As you touch across the ramp, you glimpse your body the head of a slaggy through the bloody wet and the beach so far away. In short, this is very effective theater, which leads me to my next recommendation Mr. Clinton. a similar state set, only in Norl Library instead of being a soldier leaving the boat for Omaha Beach. The visitor could walk in the shoes of Fed Chairman Alan Green's fan as he steps out of a Lincoln town car and into the dirtson Senate office building to endorse the Clinton deficit reduction strategy before the Senate banking committee. A word on the people who run these libraries is tested. Fortunately for you guys, they are very attached to their subjects, very loyal. Their president becomes a kind of mental roommate, someone they live with. And each of the library directors I interviewed spoke of their president with affections, moms almost. Dan Holt, crazy's ice-coar-sponent skill. I was nervous, wonderful letter rate. Talked up his private sector prowess. He was outstanding business. his book learned. His grammar was very good in my effect when you would use Darius letters. Even the Darius part you're a fine scholar. And his looks. Well he used to raise a read. Call the royalty you would want while you're in office. You finally get after you quit. None of the library directors have written Kiss and Tell memoirs and going on for work for If you were involved in the planning for this new presidential library in Little Rock, is there any advice you could give to those people based on your experience? Bigger restrooms, more drinking things. But I think I think if I'm truly, I'm truly, I guess, the bills of this is. First thing I think, take a look at is... called an animal trance. It is a figure of L.B.J. It has sound with it that it tells fellow Johnson stories. I'm with Library Director, Harry Middleton, in the London Dane's Johnson Library, and he's the him in Austin, Texas. We're looking at a robot of L.B.J. a robot who wears cowboy card and tells folks he's stories. Have you heard the one about the man who goes to a doctor because he's part of Mary? The doctor advised the man to quit drinking and send him home. A few days later, the man returns to the doctor's office. He hasn't stopped his drinking. The doctor scolds him. He said, did not tell you when you were here that you should cut out there. The drinking, if you wronged him, prove you hearing him. He said, yes, well, he said, why did you do it? He said, doctors said, I got home and I considered it. I just decided. I  water tracks much better than water Harry. And we've moved into this area. We show some of the course buttons that President Johnson got. Some of the quite critical, some of the supporters. There's a letter on the wall at dressed. Lyndon Johnson from one Francis Mercer of Beverly Hills, California. Mr. President, you have engaged this country in an active war without consent of Congress. I consider have worked for your campaign one of the most tragic stakes my life. As they claim, I'm going to have it against the EU or South Africa receive one or two angry letters. which brings us to the question, what are you going to do about all the people who hate your guts, not to put too fine upon us? What are you going to do about all the aspects of your presidency rather forget about? So, Memphis rumors true that in the initial exhibitions, there was little or no representation of Vietnam and that the president himself came to the library and insisted that that part of the exhibition in the city and then we're going to the second mar here look straight fish up on the thing we can do about it well, they all really go round over there And to a certain extent, that's true, the, there was a representation of Vietnam, but nothing that showed the controversy of the, when President Johnson walked through the library just two weeks before the library was open. One of the things that he commented on was that the library did not indicate how contentious that time was, and he said it to me that... a very controversial period, we've got to make sure that people know that we understand that and he said to me, I don't want another damn credibility. You mean you think the people who are in charge of a president's legacy are more apt to protect him than the president himself would be of his own legacy? Yeah, I think that's probably true. I think unless you get a clear direction from the president that he wants it all laid in the case of Johnson. I've been a director here at the beginning of this event. So I've got a lot of education on each concern that we might be too protective. He said to me, a good man have been trying to protect my reputation for 40 years. Not a bad one, a succeeded. That makes sure that you can. So we have not tried new answers. This is a Clinton. Here's a list of things. Should not whitewash. or we even discussed scandals. Let's talk about the ordinary failures. What about one of your key campaign promises to reform healthcare? A CACCO. Did a WACCO, or the 1990s Court congressional election, in which the voting public punished Republican names on their ballots with one hand while using their other hands to give you finger? I'm not even mentioning all the half ass policies Don't Act No. Tell or 받ce it, or tomorrow, yes. Finally, he did have sexual relations with that woman. He had to confront this. Again, of Jay-Life Ray-Directert, Perry Middleton. I think that a library should not cross-intensive, it should not sugarcote, it should not, in any way, distort the facts or the truth and under the height of consciousness. Otherwise, it's just unfairly public. Meanwhile, in your Belindic California. Well, first of all, I don't think a president's a library necessarily been over backwards to be objective and fair and inclusive of every important and telling fact on all sides of the art. This is John Taylor, director of the British Nixon Library in first place. It's about a 15 minute drive from Disney Man. This Harry Metal 10 of the LP J-Live Wright is doing his... jobs according to L.C.J. wishes. John Taylor is doing his job the way Nixon walked. I think people expect President to live first with black, one of you, President, President's family and the President's personal advocates. I'm handling through the museum, half-picture's Nixon, all smiles and China, and one of the other visitors at the guard. watergate. The guard tells them, keep going straight into dark room. And it is, a very dimly lit tunnel connoxling the break in at the watergate hotel through President Nixon's resignation to farewell. There are stations in the watergate gallery where one may listen to the famous tapes and there are intricate text panels with labels  what did the president do and when did she do it? Connoxling the newspaper says that one of the purposes of this debate is. that people come here expecting the museum to avoid such a store subject and that dealing with it in such an info-pack manner, tips and credibility. The most important reason to tell the story is that it happened. It was an amazing outbreak of political passion. The anger that Congress expressed during the Senate investigation in 1973 and the impeachment the continued to increase the implementation and the empire as well. Theemi-Star treaty 2014 was a fantastic investigation in 1974. since the events around the time of Kent State. And I think one season the same effect with President Clinton, who was also figure about who there was simmering passions among many conservative. There was a strong feeling among many conservatives. We all know that he quote was not legitimate, quote or that he had been engaged in activities. And all the fields is married. people and many of those passions came forth during the impeachment investigation and proceedings in 1998 and 1999. Taylor, I appreciate you and your library director President. I think it would be appropriate for Clinton Library to try to make the case for instance that there was a political dimension to Clinton impeachment and there were people who did not think President Miss Flint should be in the White House. We use the impeachment effort as a way to accomplish that end. Pointing that out is fair comment. We pointed out in our museum and I would think in a suit that they would attempt to do so in the rock well. There's a lot you can grip from Nixon Library, Mr. President, just substitute the name Clinton for the Nixon in the following text on the water gated divot. It reads, Nixon himself said he made an ex-easible misjudgements. What is it? Equally clear is that his opponents loosely exploited those misjudgments as a way to further their own purely political goal. One posh in Mr. President, the Nisan Library can sometimes see a little defensive. In the Elbjai Library, a visitor's view of history is complicated by designing both sides of the Vietnam dilemma. It's an emotional place, but... still operate within the language of good old fashion civics, a president and his constituents loudly agreeing to disagree. The Nixon Library asks, you want a fact? You'll give you some facts. And oh, by the way, grow up because you're not going to  any of them. In May of this year, we marked the anniversary of the death for a student at Kent State. Thanks to the Neil Young saw. Thanks to Way that event. generally packaged in media and in history. One, rarely hears a lot of from the perspective of Virginia Nixon. When you hear President Nixon talking in our president's form about what a dark day that was for him. It challenges the prevailing thought he was a palasma feeling for the families of those who died. In fact, he says in this museum and says memoirs of the darkest day of presidents. And he opens the door! Water game, you mix that count of the same top wherever you are, you will also burn your door and you will see. And President Nixon had to weigh the lives of those four innocent young people against the lives of the new Rebels South Vietnamese and American soldiers who live for save as result of the incursion in the Cambodian, which was the approximate cause of the demonstration at hand state, which got out of hand and led to the death. President Clinton, perhaps you're warning me... If the next library changed my mind back in the thing. You're wondering if citizens who ship their fists at your face on TV might someday drop in on a building with your name on it and maybe give you a break. I can tell you that I still think water gets poor and Vietnam was wrong. But I do find it useful to remember that those decisions, even the most deadly ones, were made not by a supernatural monster but by a real man whom we elected. A man who at least believed he was right, and that is not nothing. In fact, the Nixon and Johnson libraries were my favorite ones to visit the cause they deal with quarrels and subjects. Once years ago I was at the LBJ library. I was walking away from a copy of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 toward the photo of a servicemen who had been killed in Vietnam. In the 10 seconds it took to walk from that law to that. that face a song from a nearby pop music exhibit started playing. Louie, Louie. And I felt  all of America was in that 10 seconds. The grandeur of civil rights, the consequences of war, and the fun, fun, fun of a truly strange song. Mr. President, American White contradictions. We elected you, didn't we? So in your library, oh not to your failures, but don't stop trying to win us over. In a minute. In other words, just think of it as running for president forever.
