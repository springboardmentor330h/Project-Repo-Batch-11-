But it's pretty certain that their meeting with the town president was the turning point. His parish filled with Mexican Americans and they had some planes about local police retreating. They presented these complaints to the town president and a big meeting in the church. They got pretty heated. Town president got mad at them. They got mad at her. Must have been 500 people there. Who? Actually who? Must have that would be the end. No big deal. That's sorry, come on. Listen for the cast-guard knew. Time-haw refused to give the church a permit. Hold it to annual way of the cross-procession, least of. Next week, half of the people said years. They thought they got the... Then came the tamalex. Church youth is going away on a retreat. And they need to erase some money to do it. So they made. They didn't steal the papal night making tamales in the army. There. or out front of church, selling its mountains, a support donation for youth group retreat. So I'm just after mass, I'm still busted, I'm out front of it, so I was reading people and standing on the front porch of church. A policeman comes up, says, I have to give you a ticket father. He said, what for? I was surprised actually. He said, the ticket ran for running a business, called a license. I am 21 The ones that court with a lawyer just a friend hearing officers saying, well, now you're right there's nothing in the ordinance that says this, need license but they clearly meant to be in the ordinances but it isn't. So even though it's not there, the lawyer that was helping me asked if it would be necessary for a 7-year-old child selling lumbony on the streets just to have a business license. The answer is just... Dude, poop didn't give up. They decided they wanted to get a business license to something. They weren't square. They spent half a pie to shot, and T.D.S.S. and special training course in Phoenix, and they did all that. They did all that. They did a pie for a license. Just one hour later they said. They expected a show to put the church. They told them they couldn't get their license. They put in a third sink. They said, it's modern. Then it was a parking problem. Public school near the church had always left a lot of people saying morning, people used to go to the mass. Then it was the city of Texas. Directed to the school, the festival told me that it was an anonymous phone call saying that people were driving through too quickly, very quickly. In the school, I was something. My room was right upon this track, but I've never seen anything right quickly through us. I love this kind of strange. It's another name. phone call, send a big hit, someone on Sunday morning and bumped into the fence on damage to the school ground. Well, even the principal of salt told me father I don't see him at all, but no, I am entering the power and to close the parking. Close the laps. They said that the parking line was not sound structurally sound for parking cars. This is called strange senses. Because the teachers parked there today, something's scary. truck to speak heavy-games truck to go across. Certainly, seems at the correct last time. City of Sister Rowan says that it is not targeting the church of the ludicrous. The timing of these incidents is pointless. Count price in a teddy-worn multi-sets cap per cell, and would never wage war if you've city inspectors. One time residents have scapped bullets besides those moments and moments, but we are together as madouches where it comes. It. How did you feel about it? It's a simple. Hitler had the SS, communist as the KGB, since he was the co-edist. Okay. Sussrow is  toilets. These are not things that are normal towns in Illinois. No, it's not the same. Other communities. The Hanna Nia was a newspaper report that worked on his press account. the communities you get back. But at the mayor you have to speed with them. You don't go home worried about whether you're in the suit or whether something compounding your door inspecting house. You can disagree. You move on, even some people work well being friends. This is your always line, , cross line and sit. This is your always just different. Most of the 2018 century were direct links. We tell a pop. Pop. tasty! the 28th century, Katharine didn't hesitate to strong-learn anybody. City officials decided they didn't  you, you obeyed, you suffered, you got out of town. And then finally, Cistero got to a fight to the dead trouble winning. WB EZCHPARGO, Public Radio International, Fissumeric and Light, and Mariglas. Today on our program, Cistero Illinois, Australia, and town in the bubble, and what happens when the bubble pops. Is there before we go any further? Citroes just over the border, which had those west side. And although officially it is called a suburb, it actually looks  it's just another west side of the neighbourhood, working quite families, brick bungalow houses. For decades, Citroes was the place that could not work outside of the city. But by the way, it's black, smithed and dark. And then, at some point, the outside is beautiful. In a sense, this story today is kind of worst case scenario. You have a town connected to the mob, the touristy races. So what happens when the town starts to go through 10 demographic, that are happening everywhere else all over America? What happens when people have other races to start to show up? In large numbers. What happened in Sicura wasn't just the town opposed kicking and screaming and fighting every step of the way. So they did. So what? What's up? Just a few weeks later, first week at April 2000, townhold elected. Same Republican political machine run the town today, based Hispanic challenging. Two machines, slightly deep, despite the fact that three or six of them is now a standard. Today, we explained how that is possible. Stay with us. I am joined in this very special edition of our program by Alex Hotwitz who will be co-hosting the hour. He's the author of the books. There are no children here and the other side of the river. He's an educational tribute to our program, What Malat, Pyarl. So, as our client here is, it's sometimes going to do these stories together, it's interesting to trade off, Venus, why don't you take some action for? Sounds good? Act 1. Untouchables. To understand how Cissor handled the new folks in this panic outside is. You have to understand how the town traditionally dealt with conflict. And to understand that, I noticed my sound strange. We have to talk about alcohol. Alcohol and move to Cicero in 1924, which is harder to side the crack down on the mob. From Cicero, he rigged a lot of information from the combination of violence and kidnapings. He installed a controlled town president, the owner police force. He made Cicero into a safe haven for his businesses, which at the time he was appointed to people. What are the outside world, my Seattle? People in Cicero, remembering fond. You are so right, we didn't take a minus, Cicero. Here's a lady I met at Massman's son, father, pastor, so he abandoned. He took care of the poor, I mean he didn't keep all the money for him, so he gave out the Thanksgiving baskets, wood baskets, and that to the very poor families. So you have that a lot of money. family. Here's Kristi Burkans who once was a cowboy on the system of imperpurity of the conquest. You remember home way back when you did a little gangway officer and all the kids had yet. They would throw change in the air and all the kids described themselves. Did it quite off? You could be traveling in South America or Europe and people do the international science. the fingers  machine guns. That attack. That's right. Again, the task for the press officer, the right thing means, , the perception that I would counter all the time, the system was the mob did a good job of running the city, the point in the streets and what the mob was controlled. We got a garbage picked up, a tax or a low, . We crying was down. No, it was , it was amazing. So they were just, they would actually say, Yeah, I mean, all the time, and still do. Now it's connected to the map, didn't stop without the current. Continue straight through the present day. In the 90s, the predecessor of Oak Pade, the map connected insurance company, 4.5 million dollars, the investigation still ongoing. The fact is that the continuous string of investors, the debt and the debt ends. 5 months, this year of our pretty few town officials. 10. 51, Siserov and Team McForeus, who something to size out of control. When an African American family moved to town, a Chicago bus driver named Harvey Clark, that his wife and kids. If you took a three-day ride, which white mobs into their apartment and destroyed, pushing a piano through the wall, police watch, but did nothing. The governor had to call that the National Guard. There were other instances, as well. By the 60s, the town was known to sell more of the noise. Of course, lots of towns in the city. They were 1866, trying to keep life out, but in Cicero, they succeeded. Black were allowed in Cicero, briefly, fixed in the morning and said, that night, worked out after that, , they're not welcoming one. Real Sato seems brother-victor. Remember how in the 60s they and their bodies be hanging around on the street, when police would come by and then send them on little missions. Oh sure, many times, when we were just sitting around and saying, attracted. then was too often to come and see all this stuff that black person over, , 80 minutes per second, black. But he'd say, hey, I'm just gonna fix this thing and move them. And it's after this is the clock. And our job was, so it was basically escorting my Italian, , with black, black stones, whatever, , and if we didn't, well. We then ended up in jail for illegal gathering or whatever. There. And then we'd end this story. Talking about the black people, we always had them again through spirit battle for the Catholic ones. Walking down 14, she'd remember we had national malibos. They all worked there. They used to go into our stores and ask to butcher the make them up. Ham Sandwich and something our friend had a tavern, they used to go and have a drink and cash their text there and they walked up and down. We thought nothing of it. In fact, we'd even say hello in everything else. We were never taught to avoid them or something. They were definitely a loser in the clock. Well, that I think so. Yeah. In summer of 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. came to Chicago and there were successes in the south, and he stayed to marchers in Chicago and it was the Warren Park, and the former parker. When he threatened to march in Cisero, the town ate which was more of that it would be a suicide. That was the praise thing. Originally, the 1980s, had a re-monica effort to desegregate Cisero, failed to go to Blacktham's town. During that time, running from the east side. I wanted a few apples. Americans had mixed with them. He's out of the 1980s era mandatory human relations training to hire sister police force. Sometimes, for its act, this is a way of hyperorganization. We got there, most people came in with low tissue, flattened, sexual relation, proud of it, across the steps were in the sergeant. He had his own separate. to get set, at least with talent, fun part of this world. And that was their message to us. So this was the Empire of Mexican Americans, their audiences, starting in the making and set. Has to rest with, has to understand this, as well as... We  the folks you meet in our town. The folks you meet on any street and our town. We  the folks you meet on any street and our town. succeeding were protest marches failed. By the 70s and 80s, Old Siswell was disintegrating on its own, industry shutting down, grown kids moving away, the older generation down and off, Mexican Americans wanted their houses and built it as we could somewhat assault them to each other. After all the violence from Blacks tried to move them out. If he asked longtime residents why they felt Mexican Americans were acceptable neighbors, they often just kind of struck him up by while they weren't black. Having said that, The first way for newcomers. Things could get pretty wrong. This is Frank Egg your Lera. Family moved here in the 70s. First thing you did in my house was burn my garage. Kill my dog, you put us last thing on my door. Kill the dog. Be poised. And now it's within house soon. And in a week after we moved into Cicero. At 12 or 25 years. Why did you set to stay? Well, I was in a child, so I got a choice. Why did you family set to stay? What do you  this? They're all really particular songs and they're the very dream of their own songs. 1980, just a fraction of the time this is happening. 1990, it's the third of this world. With 2000 sets of Hispanic residents make up 77% of the time. Kevin's so my girl, she's here today. It's a cool past-bring community. She visits her mostly next. The press release of the main performance of the legs is the hand-convasion store first, safe and safe, dumpling capbook, this egg. But as this population should tap, the old guard ran the term in everything possible to hold on. So, good at all sorts of things that no other chance of anywhere seems to have over tried. The person behind most of these efforts is current press release for women in a very worn autism. She said, such a visible profile is so well, most everyone there now has to be a person as an irisashicated power. Susan's married to a city official named Frank Montice, 19 years received. Also a panel of workers, booked for a mobster with a happy name, Rockout in Police. In 1990, Frank Montice played guilty, mob related gambling truck. When he hadn't started to serve his time in the event, town president died. Frank Montice was the Arab parent, facing prison time, he had his wife pointed to the job, host a domestic knockout You guys are the same year she took office in 1993, she named the town's public safety venue. We were unable to determine that it is the only government building in Illinois, they have African victims of mobsters. The White Insurance Officer wrote, fear that having Mexican Americans in town, they Hispanic gangs are... And if I can someday be heard to the West Indian Mayor, anywhere in Montespawn place, the series ordinances. that was so aggressive that in fact, it was found to violate the United States Constitution. Persuism measured the limit the number of people who could do even anyone's resonance, apparently a big Hispanic panel. Then a measure that would seize the cars, suspected gang members, and one would have bit gang members on their own. The city started suing the parents of kids who were in gangs. In Hennenea, we're from Betty Warren, out of these starting nightmares. Describes the kind of dates surrounding these audiences. One of the ideas we came up with, isn't it? when you rest the street and put them with some public use . Making the street, making clean windows, making scour, the graffiti, off garage doors, teamwork and great idea. And Betty just needed to take one step further. She wanted to make her work pink, and in the logic was good. I think  the logic she wanted, she knew that the power of street gangs wasn't just being member was the peer-pressure intimidation. So put a pink apron on and let you tough front see you. Weeping Perms. It wasn't exactly a good idea because I remember it when it board meetings. I know a lot of us are good against it. But again, she has a way of prevailing all the rubble with me, sister. One of the candidates running against the broad of P. Gaper and town hall, just for clearly,  I said, yeah, I  the idea of the P. Gaper and let's start with your husband who was the street king member too. And they just kind of the whole city, the whole city. town board meeting just kind of erupted into pandemonium. Everybody's yelling at us. This pink apron became way into the air. Betty's screaming at the guy and the guy's screaming at her. , the police intervening is just a mini-1968 Chicago Democrat. Right. According to the other today's video program, we tried a number of towns to get an interview with Betty Law and Waltzys. But we'll always turn down by her spokesman. Dave Donny. Generally as a little she just doesn't get rid of us. Just getting any new case trying to keep me, I'm not saying bye. We asked for a copy of her step. Maybe you watch her at a fundraising, for meeting with the town committee. No way at all. They don't give out her steps and be just a threat on her life. Over the last four years she's had so many different ordinances and civil lawsuits, values, games that Dave got to tell me very and it's taken it out on her interest. She's got to get rid of him. When's the last time? How often doesn't happen? I don't really talk to Fist. She's about a much-eat takes it all. And a lot of this has been turned over to the internal and the state's turned as well. So we checked with the Attorney General and the state's turned. And they told us that in fact no one has reported any threats on our life. Which brings us to the real reason. She doesn't do anything. She's got 99% of the email de-raising staff. And  a 70% of the food. She doesn't win and enjoy the response. to the election. Under Betty Law and Laltese, Cicero cops would stop Mexican Americans for ordinary traffic violations and demand to see their green farms, town hall or to the bank through the Mexican flag to lower police. Book up a baptism park with tear gas. On David Neber moved to town, the London Police Department in 1998. This is what it is. , officers breaking down Spanish. A lot of regular basis. I learned within just the first couple of days that the quote on quote came was a recipe, a Spanish sometimes 25 to 30 people at a time. They're trying to standing on the corner. There was absolutely no probable cause whatsoever for this. Here's a new birth story. It's a brief one, but that's only because the stay in Cicero is a B. He'd actually been brought in by multis to perform the police department, or at least that's what he'd been told. Then came his undoing. He found some evidence suggesting that the towing company that does the town's towing might be selling stolen cars, and he told the FBI. The company, Ram Recovery, also happens to be one of the largest contributors to the town's the town's. Presidents can't be found. Betty Lauren will tease publicly called Neber and Nittwick, and fire him after just four months on the job. The police department should be her personal belongings. One item was a statue of a policeman who didn't hand over the board. All these stay-rethal. He got tight, he grabbed me. He hit his police off. Wait tight. Side. Presidents. When I asked Sister Respects when Dave Dunn was able to inspire, it wasn't because he was cooperating with the FBI because he simply missed andered the power documents. What Dave and Eve were doing in this kind of attempt to be the making of selfless better or to be embracing self from federal officials decided to turn over all the original tone records to the embrably Greek happened. Where I wanted a beer! and I just get that top-based thing back. What have been, and if the entire attorney was going to do that, he specifically told me, right, believe, we'll just hold on, we'll make a tapping, and we'll give him. And he, I was on his own vision, decided to turn over all the records. We'll all the original records that could have been Catholic, we'd cost a very serious problem in the town of East Asia. We're about any months, we're just not going to have to be a together with the British, and we're just going to take this thing. We're going to make a stop, and send this back. It definitely doesn't need that serious. I don't know if they give me that much. I don't even know what I'm talking about. Telling a couple of random recovery is never in date, it's denied. When I meet with real estate agent Armando Gonzalez tells me a series of horrors that have a counter-sister to us. Target his real estate firm, and cross its rules within by the other realms. Rose cast literally, hand it to task to the balance. It's definitely what being the largest real estate firm in town. 48 sales agents, huge office space, being run out of system. Thank you. We did not know how to respond to the problem that we had, but ages were having problems with inspections, and some of us and I have been able to get the compliance in the room where our terror was, that we were in trouble with the time of the soul. People didn't want to give us business. When I'm out of the town, I was to access right at court. I judge real that in fact, he had been treated. So why did Tom Ross sing along out? It was a peculiar treatment. The Thomas' lawyer suggested it was because he was Mexican-American, and more than anybody, was building a new wave of low-cost homes from Mexican Americans. Though Tom Ross was helping to slow the spanning regression, Tom Ross' way, but it's  very effective strategy. Perhaps he just wasn't doing business the Cicero way. On the witness staff, the Thomas told the story of how he needed a certain count permit to set me on a very warm morning's advices. Tom, get... permit, it should be short to take care of petty. He sent her flowers. He was rumored, this was not occurring. What he's spoken about by the way denies the sapon. The count is human pairs. Whatever the truth is, the Xalusus' problem is the count, the David Nebris, don't seem to be only about race. And this is part of what makes all this so complicated. At some point it seems, how hard it decided they didn't matter what race ended up as well. But matter, it's a decade by six row groups. Those rules can tell us, as our mark will be familiar to someone  him who grew up in Mexico. This town that's made life so hard for Mexican Americans, he says, actually runs a lot, the old one party government in Mexico. And it is  a gourmet that shouldn't exist in this country. I don't know why this thing is kept happening since  somehow they are untouchable. They do whatever they want. One difference between the sister of government, the old PRI part, RadMexica, says, is that in Mexico, after 70 years, people voted the old guard out. Why that hasn't happened in sister-up? In a minute, from our own PRI, public radio and international, when our approach. This is American Life from Eric Glass. Meswix in a program of course we choose some theme, or you also have different stories on that theme. Today we're dividing our entire show to a brief history of Cicero Illinois. Since directly next to Chicago, 85,000 ss. And that's the sort of the decades tried to keep the world today. And what happened in the world, used to stay at bay. The special edition of our show today is co-hosted by journalist Alex Kautnerwitz. We have arrived at that three of our show at three, four by eight. So, his Spanish was sometimes treated badly by term cover. But this is democracy. Spanish make up three force the town's population. How hard could it be? Vote out the current administrative. station, owning somebody of their own. That's what Joseph Mariam Mariana thought. His county commissioner moved to town about a year ago. What it'd be known that he was planning to challenge, that he wore in Maltese, or a present. Mariana was welcome acting. It looked  the first time this spam can make good reason. So town officials introduced a referendum, lengthening the residency requirement to run for president from the year they were in a half. This would have kept ring a lot of the race. It's all along the federal judge. that he knocked the referendum off the ballot and then told the town to the next five years federal monitors for the sentices on watch over every election. Then on December 15th last year, Rainland is likely coming home from the late night party Chikaka.com. He claims they were tailed by an unlocksistral police crime. He was the entered cisterl, they spotted another cruiser parking from Slipestone right on the board. Both scientists say they are going to stop music up us, there are waitings. I was given field sobriety tests, past those tests, 40, half hours later, I found I was charged to the Y, and I asked the breathalyzer, he said, climb the softest in the cave to me. I got to do what I was told to do. They claimed that it was a ramp stop. I tried a black navigator with marinoplex. You could swim. I mean that incident baptized me into this robot. This was a smear kit, ran a meta-deasy person's. This was a smear kit, ran a meta-deasy person's. This is a previous DUI condition. It's actually illegal for him to ride the night and all. It's very warm out he's a skeleton down here. Down here, halfway, quits out. To sit in his frame, he's not. get pretty and get driving on a boat license and you drive on a boat license, you want. That's why today, you still, you ask when you drive in the night and say, if you want it, you're using it. And that's true. We asked him. Can everybody truly go or he weren't supposed to be driving? That's true. So, now he's driving. There's one other thing you want to discuss with you. Just to be clear, I need a chance of when you're about to drive. Was it? they looked good to try and all epic scenes. Sumi, I was driving absolute. Regardless, the Attorney General, you see nothing he needs to prosecute more people. And in February, Maltese campaigned for another time. Until I'd be local news that. Political rivals of Cook County Commissioner Joseph Mario Moreno first accused him of beating one of his ex-wives and failing to support their child. Siding 90s. of the board divorce files in which a dianimorenal claims a Josephorenal subjected her to repeated mental cruelty. He will no longer accept a fallen leader anymore. It is hurting my community, it will hurt I.E. and it will hurt everyone. Problem was, they had the wrong guy. As marina told reporters, had his own press conference. We'll do that there. Great news stated. That Joseph Moreno, in that 74 divorce case, is not. And the hands of the right candidate, such a blatant and botched attempt of character assassination, could be spun into political goal. But Marino hasn't really capitalized from the opportunity of his hand from him. What's more, Marino is rather soft than specificness about what he'll do from his sister-in-law. He means a lot more on the big general status, about how it's time to elect him to respond. When we ask to my campaign against Rob, please listen. Why am I doing it? Because I'm the chosen one. I have no idea. It needs to be done. And I think, Sistro is long overdue for this change. When he starts saying, well, we need to change the change. It's too late. Too late. The change has been in process. The change happens. Frank had to wear our works for Betty Warren, not T's. And he says, compared to when he first moved to Sistro, things definitely happen. This is not. I mean I was jumped many times 25 years ago. And the police looked at me while I was getting jumped 25 years ago. Because I'm asked, we met at Go Error, at Go Primary, at Bad Boyd, and he wore a motifs, it's primary, at G-T-Py, at the Global Loons everywhere, at the buffet, and check in the match with Gators, about a third of them, it's a spanning. I wanted the tables to remember the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, it was a spanning. Tell me that they debated for a long time, it was a question. There was a course book, the Nian. They're  the idea of an Hispanic him. They just felt Marana wasn't a job. Luis were her fellow in the Cavalry. He's a treasure. He says sure, he's interested in using sense of meaning. Sure, some things have had it still being. But he likes it, that moties just being. He likes things, he's a cracker. what? We knew that Cister was stopped, and that is the reason we moved here. When you talk to the Mexican American homeowners, Obviously. they  the security that they feel, , with the current administration, with so many cops, they move them into a town, looking for a better way of life. And obviously, they move them because they thought that, , CISRO is more secure than Chicago. , I mean, I grew up at 26th grade and I know what that is. And I move them to CISRO because I looked in the area and it's, , sure, , cops are above, , but really realistically that is what I want. Very very multi-says campaign slogan is, she's tough because she cares. It's actually this combination, toughness caring. It's new about it, not it is. At some point in the candidate, must have become clear. She'd never stay in office, and she only respond from her part of the stand-ups. The hostile word in the six, and he appears in me. Because those old schools to throw attack, she's out of the more modern approach, and you're taking power for sharing. Where do you... seem to show. And so today in Sisura there's an army to some custody and the foundation all happening at the same time. She's helped build five schools from the most armed families in town. There are lots of the spend faces in town hall. Three at the four time for a season of our spend. What is this assistant is his family. And she just announced the minority service I've come from. When public money in minority owned businesses and before she takes a stage wrong for seasons. You're menino. Boy is the one who believes but I don't know. Count trustee of American's honest, just a speech. He thinks the campaign works. Threaten stands and supposedly disrupting voting. Who is the first? Evie, I'm ready! He will yoke Eddie and Bihop. And then, there she is. Finally, Seren, person. Betty Roy Maltese, looking a bit  the list of the tower during John Wartonians, middle-aged woman in black pants suit, heavy black breast scare, long eyelashes, crown of keys to fucked up hair. Even the ham-handedness of her attacks on Marano, Chandler's the crowd and the press, her half does D.D. times present, and the season political pro. She has a certain charisma, prideably, for the person she does, is actually paying, better or more than she came to town, for her own. I want to thank the outside agencies, despite the fact that that on monitors came in because I know I was a tedious task with that, and I'm sure they did not want to be here. And I hope it will continue to remain with us because I think I'll see that the problem was not what I would be publicized. But... I am... Now on after, she reads today's website, coding results. She was running the publicized. Are we public in the Bell's gas for 7,499? The M3X with 798. Look for the man, I mean, it doesn't democracy. In the end, twice as many people were both most decent as we're all the other candidates in both parties, in comparison. It's a measure of what a long shot this race is from greater people in the general Basics. The ones believed for we could party enough while you again. I was never afraid again. Mario running, I was afraid of him, right? Ah! Ah! Greatness of Echanceous. Great thousands of new brothers and sons. We know when it's a suicide. No. Meanwhile, anywhere in Maltese is a mess, million dollars for spend. A huge, free space. Many, some, but election it in town. You can drive and get in. You just admit it. Thank you and keep us this role! At core, they say our love is here to stay. Kind of  sister-up, what it produces is inside there's an outside. And just as some people can be predicted being on the inside, you can get addicted to the rush of trying to bring the system down. This next story is the story of somebody who got stuck doing that. It is broke! for a long, long time, and he tried to get away, but I turned out not to be so easy. Now let's just call story of winning to our listeners, there's a possibly questionable word in somewhere in this story. This past October Dave Boyle is likely to do new backstitch serial after being away for 10 years. I have unfinished business to told you. Let me first though, fully on Dave's first time in this serial. He moved here in 1983 and accidentally stumbled into the pond politics. aha One morning on his way to a contract in his job, Dave drove past Mr. Seves. A bike was bought on corner. Some guys were standing around outside drinking, and the other side walked way up , been stabbed to death. It was shot Dave wanted the bars shut down. So he went to see the town step in the liquor commission, who was also a police officer. He was told to back off. Many of the town members were connected to the mall. I am very sorry. I'll talk I will talk you take your oil, they might kill me and that's that. So you just go away and you say that nice. You're just a smith of mission and tell to this for a minute, say okay, bye. I just got that. I just got basically it. I have day boiled. I got right. And I asked police officer to be right there and he told me the map on what you do. Nice work. Okay, let's start. A word here about Dave Boyle is a Vietnam bet in this built- Arabian player. Under difference circumstance, Dave might have been a ball-lean baller. His loud, curses locks, likes to brag about what a good fighter is. And short, the perfect person to take on Cicero. In fact, it's hard to imagine any other kind of person being wrong to take on the town. At the top. Cisteros still had a whole thriving district with scriptrooms, prostitutes, and bars, stayed up until 6am. Dave thought to get Mr. Sees shut down, and then went to the police department and used typically a belligerent way, ordered them to close down five other bars. 12 hours later, my garage blew up, cars, my tools. I'm not sure if you can see it. Yeah, I'm not sure if you can see it. I'm not sure if you can see it. Yeah, it's not fire. It's just this. You lose a coincidence. It was, ... Took about 10 minutes to work all day to grab. That's all. As you've probably observed about Cicero by this point, it doesn't likely tell what to do, especially by outsiders. So you can imagine on how angry the town is for when Dave is  collecting enough signatures for... the referendum's shut-abars to a map. Then the referendum passed by 3-1 margin. Nothing happened. The then-town president ignored the vote, which transformed it into a kind of minor celebrity. The story is about a new newspaper to non-TV. He was talking to the FBI. So what might otherwise have been a fairly small matter, time-bars should close, suddenly Why getting quiet there? They even had been misunderstood that smoke slung over their fun puts. real and the police arrested for threatening to arrest him some 11 times. We all took off real lives and all got to be... I can talk to my friends and friends. I felt so weird. I felt different than they did. They were having babies. , decorating their houses with Laura Ashley things and , building up. Yeah, cleaning up real cars and cleaning up ashes from the crowd. It was completely different life and the only people who seem to understand us were reporters and people from the crime condition and the FBI and other people from the system. Here's how far it went. Dave may not want but two bids for local office. But his bluntness and go at a loan style didn't exactly win them votes. At one point he posted a sign in the town of Muslims. of some future office of Dave Boyle, who lost postal elections. After seven years of fighting town hall, Dave and Dave decided for his time to go. Friends felt they were running out of town, and though Dave says it wasn't case, it was. They were beaten down, drained both emotionally and financially. And indeed, quite frankly, just wanted to get the hell out of there. So they moved to use the taxes, the 19-9. BEST FALL CANNOTE WAS LATER. He suggested me Dean that, hey, maybe they move back, need Dean Bawkes. So Dave promises me Dean, what? I'm a good son of office time around. They buy a brick bungalow this past October, and Dave's in Wonders in the town hall, and she's some old faces. I was at the town hall, I can't remember. The exact date was at a level. apartment, month, month and a half ago. And I was handing some papers and I looked at my right, RSE, it's on the card. Neelotipy left you to see ghosts and I said, stir-terry, good morning, I approached the empty shades. He was ahead of the building card. Many of those guys call him card homes. He made sign of the cross. He's front of me. Just hear back. Oh my god! Let me make quick to sight of the cross. Stay at the gate. I'm resetting. You can get it. Dave notices changes in the town. The stripped room to go on, to law is finally closed at 2am. Lots of people everywhere speak in Spanish, which he likes. But the town he earns is still up to its old tricks. When he and the looms settled on their house, they were asked to sign a document which would give the town the right to search their home for housing code violations anytime at one. do that every Mexican by the house of the town. And we'll just look around, who's by the house of the city. They're Mexican. They don't read English. They got three people, three burgers, to pay off one mortgage. And they're all telling them about us. And they're all signing these affidates that give the police the right to enter. Anybody can turn off right to enter their house without notice. And without a warning. David's sister could have changed the wording of the document, which they did, that same day. And that got the ball rolling. Soon he got involved in the upcoming elections, working for a candidate as a closing Betty Law on multiple feats. For no doing, as you might imagine, it all begins to feel familiar. He said, it's going to be different this time. I'm a lawyer, not at the same thing. He said, it's going to happen. Don't worry. I won't get involved. Politics. I won't run for office. I'm certainly going to want you to have money to do it. I can't even use any of our money. So could I give away? So I can't. Okay. What have you been back on? I'm just... , some sectobra about not getting... I'm not sure if I'm off. Yeah. He has quite kept... He's a little bit... I'm not sure if he's been off. I told him once when we used to start to get involved with this recent campaign. I said, Dave, I see you going down there. World pool is taking you down again. He actually pulled back. He didn't let me see. But that was he did. I asked Dave what his next movie is. I'm going to build a new catch garage in tells me. No, how about in terms of the town I asked, this smile says, let's part of a have to apply for a common receipts. That's his plan. Say bad things about the town president and the public. And then apply for a place. come. These days one of the most interesting things that exist around. Despite everything we've told you this hour about town hall and cognizing its own citizens, is this. You actually walk the neighborhoods and talk to people about how they're getting along with the neighbors. Let's be perceived to be getting along just fine. There are lots of stories, older white residents who were wary at first, then warmed up. There's still rough moments. The things seem way more friendly than you would expect, giving the terms of Alex, but together this story. Here's another way to measure the changes in society. We met a woman in the redder river, moved to town back in the middle. She founded to be so hostile to this man, the junior family moved down. Five years later, after more Hispanics at settled in Cicero, she tried again. This time it was easy. The redder told me about 200 and more of them. Both of them were more racist. She considered one of them to be very accepting and one not accepting at all, but the reality may be more complicated than that. Here's a letter with one of the women, Annie Ryder, and then in the consent. They're close friends, even though the letter now a second grade teacher is for me, and a widow of 74. The letter is explained to me that what it was  the first time she met us in the drama and moved to Cicero. I told you about when we used to rent 50. third court, the Polish guy, they're almost getting tough at the Canado. His big problem was that we were parking in the house. I never told you that it was Christmas Eve. And he was a little tipsy and he came out screaming at us telling us, , you should go back to your country while the hell are you here? You should be parking for my yard. I beat taxes, you don't get anything. And I remember Canado because being so angry, I'm not too bitter and ini. because he was going to get out. And I remember, in a while, out of frustration, what he said he said he's saying his English was very broken. And I remember him telling me, he'd go back to Poland. I said, you ever said it wrong? You don't say it that way. And he also again blendasting. That that's why sister was in such a bad rut because it was since next to the start more in here. We were running the town. blah blah blah. Every house has ruined so many. It's , oh, forget it. We usually talk about how newcomers assimilate because they're new and violent. But as I listened to Annie, LaRetta, I was struck by how it was in. He was assimilated to the newcomers. Did you see why you used to walk every morning? Yeah, it's a clock. Yeah, blah blah. Just13 tonight, about. You all know what I said and then she forget said. I remember when we first started walking. Remember we made a deal. We always going to teach you a new word and then the next day I would ask and she would go, I'll forget it. And then we would come and have coffee. Up the 12th homes on Anderson Reduce Street 7, I'll own my steps. bright lights. It isn't at the white hallmarks to stay when necessary we more tall and we can mostly laugh. Some of the older folks in the dear older lives we just didn't want to go. Despite frequently feels from the old times. I remember getting something in the mail. Something about if you're not comfortable where you live, if you're safety, if you fear for your safety, call this number we'll sign your house. Oh I called up it. I called up the realtor. It was black. You're doing the same thing as the blockbuster. You're doing the same thing as the blockbuster. That stuff really, it's good to my mind at school. It's just somebody else to make blockbuster. When I first met LeWet and I asked her about her angle and movements, she volunteered to story that happened. she first moved in 12 years ago. It clearly still bothers her. It involves the other older white woman on the block, Nancy Shelton. Nancy's 7th was lived in Cicero for an entire life. Nancy's actually been friends with Anne since she was 18. In fact, Nancy found Anne in her house. But rather, remember that so you can come in to the effect of the quality of life in Cicero and become a client since Mexican American people. But there was more of a game problem. He wouldn't look at me  if it was my fault and I would tell our Nancy we're not all the same. Just  in every race there's good apples and bad apples. Do you see my kids get ? But I don't think I ever really put it meaner under state. So I went to visit me as his home is just three doors to help. And I was kind of surprised by what I know. I'm perfectful contenter. And I have to say... We see a lot more flowers getting planted around here than we do with the old timers. We do, they're planting gardens and fixing houses up. A lot of the homes were let go by the older people. They weren't caused by the Hispanics Museum to strike. They were already on kept buildings. And that Hispanic people come in many of them are really trying to fix things up. It turns out that Nance helped Dave Boyle close to him is to see his writers are going board-to-door competitions and she raised $600 in the E-Bill Boyle's Charter Logs. For Nance,  me, and this was her home, so it never occurred to her. Have you learned Spanish? I took one course of conversation with Spanish and Mark College, we're back for the second course that you didn't have enough students sitting at the course. I used to go home one little star over here when I was taking a... course and a greeting in Spanish is Ola, hello. Every day I'd go and start and before I walk there I thought, I got this right this time and I go and I go, hello! And they just cracked up there, no, that's wrong! So here she comes here, ? You have your quietest mixed food? Oh yeah sure I make mixed food and stuff. My son lives Mexican. I couldn't ask for a very son at home. He's in a business and his family. He's wonderful and he does it. And I told him when the kids realized, our teacher could Spanish, but he didn't want to do that. I can't be real straight. I was curious to me about talking about it. Finally, I got up to courage to tell him that we're ready. I thought she had some hostel with me towards his family. Oh, no, I don't know why she did. The other thing, I think I was able to argue. I got one who's a puppy, so I went and smiled all the time. My daughter picked him up, twice, and I was going to get back her. We're ready. the car's screeching, there's Jenny picking the dog up and she yelled at the red of her, she said, keep the dog in, he's going to die because we had a child and we loved it. That's her answer to the acting coach. Nancy doesn't recall, we can kind of come on the arts, so we're ready to complain about it. But she does remember telling the red of her, there wasn't any problem, and that a lot of Hispanic people don't think to have children. This is where we get into the area where she and the red of me never see eye to eye. Nancy, Nancy, she's taking seconds.
