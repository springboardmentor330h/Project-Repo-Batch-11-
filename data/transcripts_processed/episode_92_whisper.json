He called me back a couple of hours later. And he said that he wanted to talk to me about something. And I said, well, what? And he said, he wanted me to know that it completely moved him. That I wanted to see him with all of his masks off. And I told him, , Dome! Leave the mask on. Leave the mask on. It scared me a little bit. I'm a little bit.

If we can program with course we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and quarters, tackle that theme. Today on our show, leave the mask on.

But one of the most unusual things that can happen, as you age, is to see a new sight of somebody in your own family. Somebody who you feel   backwards and forwards. Somebody who you have known for decades. Raydemarky Rockland had this experience recently with her father. As he entered this new world that she never imagined that he could ever be found. About four years ago, my father made Nellico right-hand turn and ended up at Traffix School. At the beginning of the eight-hour course, a pretty blonde instructor asked each class member to stand up in front of the group and give his or her name and talk about the law they violated. This is what my father told me to be saying. What my name is Fred. I was born and raised near no Galoisar as well. My parents had immigrated their promotion. It was a body. A couple of months before he had taken a seminar from the famous monologue is Spalding Gray called True Stories, autobiographic story telling. By the time he returned home, he dechumulated a pocket full of addresses from the 12 or so professional actors that had also attended and a habit of quoting Spalding Gray. The audience says, make them laugh, make them laugh. in crime. Spouting says, go beyond the frame. Spouting says, where's the emotional charge? Spouting says, exaggerate. My father told me that it was very important to get you work out there. I was flunky out. Well, at the sim, the Japanese government saw fit the bomb Pearl Harvin. So next month, January, just two weeks before finals, I got very patriotic. Brilliant showing of것도. And he was also capable of recruiting at 18th probably. And he was small and he Comedy. Our country was the most decent in the world. What do you think? Of course, we're the most resistant person to us. And I lost the new Army Erko. My father kept on  this for about 15 minutes and then the instructor jumped up began waving her arms in the air and shouted at him that if he didn't stop talking and sit down she was going to lose her job. She was swept back to her place at the back of the classroom by booing traffic violators and couldn't believe that the old guy, with the thinning hair at the wrinkled hands and the white tennis shirt was the one that turned this exercise in forced contrition on its ear. And it wound up being kind of simple. It seemed  all the kids that were lost got sent off the pilot training. When kids with German or Scandinavian last name from the Center Bombardier School. Next skin kids were given a choice between pair of troops or infantry. And then there were the Jewish kids, what to do with them? Or hell, they were only tenons. Every single one of us was sent to Navigation School. See, our drill saw drill saw drill explained, look, everybody knows you heaves a good of numbers, and all a navigator is just a little quiet happy. About a quarter of an hour passed before my father came to the end of his story and walked back to his bed of folding chair. Later, he told me that for a couple of seconds there was only a stunned silence. Then, slowly, he said the class rose to their feet and gave him this first standing curveation It was nine years ago when my father abandoned the square world of architecture to his partners, and retire. The first thing he did was rent a small studio near his house, set up a drafting table, and find himself a handful of jobs. It was around this time that he started showing up at my apartment unexpected. At least once a week my doorbell would ring and therein be standing with his toolbox. me if I had anything that needed fixing. Whenever he'd say this he'd always have an uncomfortable word  he was embarrassed. Until that time I thought I'd seen every kind of expression on my father's face. But back in those days, when he'd be standing there, there was something so vulnerable about him, it was almost as if I was looking at his strange arm. So I think of something that was broken and he'd follow me up the steep flight of gray carpeted stairs in my house. And with each step he'd shake up a little more of the... certainty until by the top of the stairs in resemble my father again. Sometimes I'd wonder if I'd only imagine that he'd seen the theory no little bit lost. If you were going to draw a timeline that showed the theory of the four and after my father really gotten to the swing of retirement, the after part would have to begin with spouting grades MonoWog Workshop, because after that nothing was quite the same again. Before I get too far ahead of myself. It would probably be appropriate to explain what learned my father's alternate experience. The truth is, I have an incredible. I can't say that once I discovered that his dramatic subgenre of choice was semi-autobiographical anecdotes from the 1940s, I found it a lot easier to get behind him 100%. He's an unpredictable man. As far as I'm concerned, he could have just as easily decided to appear naked on stage, wearing a beret, or reciting the speech of mine. nightmares which would go something  this. My name is Fred Rothheim, my third and worst behaved daughter is Margie Rothheim. Rarely was there in argument in our household that she wasn't at the heart. And at this happen I'd have to do a preemptive strike, getting my version of things out into the zeitgeist before he did. Let me exact be spent with him. Writing the one person play goes solo, the play writes kitchen ensemble. These are the names of some of the classes that he took. Titles that have an uncomplicated sound, yet are somehow filled with hope. I can understand why he would thumb through the extension class syllabus and they would back into him. For all this, the first time I saw him perform I was totally surprised what a different world here become a part of. There's a period in a group, so... at a tiny space on a dark side street in Santa Monica. To get in you walked up the driveway that into the dusty antivore, that into this makeshift theater. And against one wall there were wooden leachers, splintery gangplanks that my aging relatives who came to support my father, Teter Long, while I held my breath. There wasn't really a stage, just a peanut concrete floor with a curtain behind it. The show began. A couple of very men performed in drags. It's so unbelievable that it was impossible to know if they just failed miserably at trying to pass themselves off as women, or if their disguises were intentionally for laughs. A skinny woman took a running job and landed on her knees on a wheeled dolly and came whizzing in front of the audience to begin a rambling narrative about religion, which culminated with her holding a giant picture frame of fun and for self and doing a wriggling booty dance for the crowd. I can't imagine what my relatives would think. If you skim your finger down the list of names on the program, you'd find my father at the very bottom. It said old man in a baseball cap by Fred Rockman. An hour and a half later he came out. He looked smaller than me and he was squinting his eyes tight. His voice sounded strange,  his, but more in fat. He talked about being a- navigator during World War II of how he witnessed the miracle of childbirth by helping a splitter and dr. named Connor delivered the baby of a 15-year-old Italian peasant. So, Connor lifted up the scalustrest, but he couldn't get a past her belly, the swollen belly. So, he reached into his bag and pulled out one of those butt, low surgical scissors, and went, and just ripped that leg, right apart. Well, I was shocked! Look, I was very young. Although I had those usual teenage sexual foreings in the back seat of the Chevy, we the eye had never ever seen a local woman be. Here is this woman, this ought to hit the wall woman with this new belly. And there's two tremendous breasts. And there's skin, there's skin where yellow and blue and purple and red in the gym to all block you. And the party said, Jesus Christ! I think this girl's got a parent 90s. Rockets, we gotta do something. We gotta try to save you baby. We're not being able to save your mother. You tell them this is corrupt or the warm so long. You're gonna have to do a cesarean right here, right now. I'm making a decision right about here. You start cutting her pubic hair. And I looked at that pubic hair. She had hair from a belly button all over her belly. Down there, get down there, find all the way to her knees. It was just a mess of hair. On it. brought my dad there as a transland. He spoke Spanish not Italian, but nobody seemed to care. The two of them let the girl onto a table and the doctor performed a cesarean into liver at the healthy baby born. Mr. Karat, I came over, portissi to shot a grandi. He said, Salud, asked that girl. The girl, she was a saint. And caught her packed up his gear. He started to go. Mrs. Karat was caught. And she said, what is the name of the girl? I said, Connor, they're name in the media. And I was proud of him. I thought that I'm getting to know Connor. And good to be American Army, we've done the right thing. And we started going on this time. She started saying, Kersoulon. And I said, Fred Riko. She said, So I got to hear all the words of legends. Yeah, more presently, equal Taratha. And after helping bring this baby into the world my father told but it was  to go in a bombing run seven hours later that culminated with a complete and total destruction of the small town in Hungary that he knew was the wrong target. At the end, the audience did what they did at the traffic school. They rose to their feet and gave him a standing ovation. Then it dawned on me why he was at the very end of the show. Now is it one... the follow-on. I should have known that he did well. He's an overachiever. His success came with a rapidity that made all my struggling actor friends hardsip. He spent two snowy months in residency at the Medellar Riders colony. In his first years of performance, the National Cultural Correspondent for the New York Times did a big piece on him coin. stories morally complex and starkly funny. Produce is in screenwriters want to meet with my father. I repeat that. Produce is in screenwriters want to meet with my father. 200 people apply to perform at the prestigious Louisville Art Festival this year. My father was one of the four people chosen. For eight nights he performed his one-man show. My father, Fred Rockman. The artist formerly known as dad. We're doing it all over. The most important thing is to start a lot in the wrong direction. Okay, almost. Brotherhood from downstairs or even just moved to the right direction. The most important thing is to start a lot in the wrong direction. Here's another new experience my dad is having in his 70s. He's doing crafts with his kid. Though he's having all the success, he's not used to being subjected to the opinions of others. Not that long ago, I went to the small theater where my father rehearsances. I snuck into the back of the room and watched him roaming around the stage, whose words echoing out the walls. At first, he didn't notice I was there. He didn't look up and saw me, and then he looked away. He looked self-conscious. He didn't look  anyone I know. This is awkward he said. I can't remember he never sang that to me. So in other words, the whole, the issue of the direction's walking. is raised dealt with and resolved, calling one spot, and then he moved through the next section which is the whole difference. My father has a director. Her name is Lori Latham. She's a member of the community that has been heard of, that doesn't include his family or his old life. When he first started taking Lowe's classes, he was 30 or 40 years older than everyone else. He didn't seem to mind. This might have been a part of the draw. It made him excited. I don't know what... in Trixin about the out of town seminar populated only by militant lesbians. I'm gonna ask him about it now for pretend not to be numb. Okay, you're still that timey about a nerd that you were in a group. I don't know, I really don't know. I want to be active. I don't think so. It may be some of my folk work. What am I? Well, you called me up. I don't think so. I don't think so. I'm just a little bit too. I'm just a bit too. But you call me up and ask me about if I knew if I'd ever heard it before from the out of town. I was not in the hood class. I was in the London. When I first started talking about it, he would tell me funny stories about young women with tattoos, pierced tongues, and shaped heads who would only do rants about a pressure about how men kept them down. And how when they said they were men, the entire room at Stair at them. Later he told me a bug in my purse. He didn't do anything he said. Then it went off his... so long and kept staring at him so queuesingly that he couldn't help but be amused. But then a couple of days later he called to tell me that he was feeling ashamed of he'd made light of this memory. Their angry dietrives had given way to unhappened memories about leading home to quickly in parents that were critical of her. And have tried to make do on small page sets from their crummy and unemiel jobs. This women who stirred protective feelings inside her. Their life is so hard and small, me. I think they think of me. is a father. The day after the rehearsal, there's a warm-up show for Louisville. My father is very nervous. Meanwhile, I'm worried that my tape will throw him off. So we can know wireless mic on him before the performance, and I go outside and receive them the stairs. Before the show starts, this is what is recorded straight onto the tape. I don't actually hear it until later. Want to try the شيepeting model again? I'm going to be in trouble. Hit my moment. I'm going to be with Danny and I'm not going to be the next. Second. Now, I just... Hit my moment. I'm going to be in trouble. What do we want to learn about our parents? What do we want to see? This is an odd thing to admit, but when I took the tape home, I realized that I was scared to listen to it. I was scared of what I might find out. Until I listen to this tape, I'd never... I've heard what my father sounded  when I'm not there. He was what they found out. When I'm not around, he sounds just  him. Okay, so then he goes to the showtime right time. Forget everything I told you. He's got there and beat big. Okay, got that. My stage. And put it to a smaller stage than what you think. Because we got a bunch of people sitting on the floor. That makes it done. Okay. So we just can have to roll it down. You have a great time. But what you do is so beautiful. You're from the army. You're from the army. Cheers. Every seat is filled. Growing up, sitting on the floor cross leg at, in fact, there were people in the parking lot arguing over the last few tickets. The space where my father's performance is twice as wide as a bowling lane and there's a chair and an end table with a ball of slip-a-wits on. It isn't until the show started that I realized how big a risk my father is taking. This time, he's in part of the group. There isn't going to be a girl in a fairy god-mothers-dressed babbling about who knows how much I'm inصل. Look at it. I'm the most un sı мин Beethovenian in the world. Using how much it costs, I need less access... Interested girl is just  you do with her. not first so that by comparison my father seems  the wisest man on the planet. It's just him, slowly working his way towards the front of the audience. And suddenly I notice I need a terrible non-mustown. I sit there on the stairs in the back of the theater. He gets his first lap and then another. And now I feel so relaxed I can't even be attention and what he's saying. All I want to do is stare at the faces in the crowd. Everybody seems to be brilliant. join themselves, especially whenever my father mentions anything that has to do with sex. Lusted by the law when the wish to walk you up. And she said, ''Brat, you think I know beautiful? And I said, what the hell you talking about? And I looked at her, I could see she was crying. She said, ''Me, fret me. I am for you. I know what is my base. ''Brat, once you get in here, I'm sure'' You think it is to be the part that we disturb, but it doesn't. What I find jarring is whenever he talks about killing people. There's one particular moment when he talks about shooting three German soldiers. He's been ejected from his plane, is wandering behind enemy lines, meets this woman, and the moustache who is helping to make his way to it all. They come to us. little village full of American sympathizers. In the headman came over, he made a speech kept hearing the word of America's. When we all started walking off, when it's outskirts this village, with a little hut, he managed to say, I know you said that you're not a hard man. You thought if they did you a gun, he must do it for you. But the suggestion nature, you must, they will kill you immediately. I don't  it. So that gave me the proofs. And he got this little hot headman spoke some more. And many eggglow was changed. He under the hot called these three young German boys. They were guys about my age, about 18 and 19 years old. They had a German great uniforms on the barefoot. Had SS and senior army collar and they had a chair around the neck and down the wrists and around the ankles. They had been terribly beaten up. How did they talk about them? They look  newsy boys. He was a dog. He was a headman smile. I heard the word of melatonoscopy. He hadn't eaten the birch then. And he was just saying, I don't know what to do. He must do it. And the bell just started going, Chatter, Chatter, Chatter, Chatter, Chatter. Jesus Christ, I didn't want the shooting body. And the wish was his son. I do it. Do it. And that pulled the trigger. And the gun went, I just saw those things. voice and the village is just went wild with its psyche. We started walking up for it and the village. I've always assumed that this story isn't true. I don't think I'm right. is this kind of man. In fact, when he showed me an early draft, I told him to take it out. And it first he did, and then he put it back in. And after friend of his name Patrick Flannigan told me that one night after class my father told him that the story about shooting a three German soldiers' trip, but that he didn't want me or my sisters or my mother to know because he thought I would have set us too much. I asked my dad, what am I supposed to think? And I told him that this man again backstage in the second evening. the whole story,  it's true, but isn't. And you're the ad told me that that's all the story. So you actually did. Well, the interesting thing is the idea of somebody who wanted to know. And particularly actually, I'm a little bit scared of you. I don't think that's a mission, then it's a story, it's a metaphor. How is there a difficulty attack? You're teaching me a man in the head? Yes. Really? Oh. So when did you find food to go and find a food to drink? Yes, doctor. Yeah. That's up to you, is? Yeah. I have a talk to see you and you've asked a very good question. He's up to you, doctor. I've got him. I've told you that you didn't listen to my calls. But you're not even going to get in touch. We call Patrick Flamagan, the truth, and we are not one with these things, one with the evil. I don't think I'm going to be a big issue. I'm sorry. But the truth story is that the beginning has no borders, so we need to not be the strong. Yes, please. I'll be best my love. To the best of his knowledge, at this point I have no idea how to assimilate this information. ... Even seeing my dad's squorum under my questions is decided him I've never seen before. We argued about it so much that I started to get worried what if he's coming clean about something that he did so many years ago? I asked one of my older sisters the same thing concerned her and she told me that she assumes that all the upsetting parts of the story are made up. I don't know which version of him. My father may have shot those soldiers or who may not hear him, but one thing is for certain. When he goes to these classes, he can be whoever he wants and God bless him for that. How wonderful form you got the chance. The Bible is saying to the heavens, are you all happy? After the show, I sit back, stay with my father. People start screaming, pretty soon it's  a cocktail part. The engineer who is with me is looking at this. young women who are persons who are room and are hugging and kissing my father. The law puts his hand up in a microphone and says to me, the father knows a lot of babies. The fact that they are babies is a bonus. I think my dad would be just as excited with any kind of man. Which is really wonderful, as you see that my father water is getting the kind of attention that most people don't get a taste. Frankly, that most people don't get at all. Yeah, it's just the huge adventure done. What time? After those last night, they were just, oh, yeah. Being  hanging out and on the people. Yeah, I'm going. Yeah, how do you think they're going to have a place more and more? If these kids suddenly lose cars, they're going to be , oh, yeah. Isn't it cool? What are you doing? All the greatest. When you're such an inspiration, you're definitely a little bit more. Well that's very nice. What's the difference between my heart and the fact that you're getting it? Yeah, , actually, you can see it's a little bit. Okay. You're a source of inspiration, , half a little bit more. And probably the little bit more. Well, that's... That's a lot of fun. So, you should be beautiful. that quite a lot, sir. It's so pretty. It is. And why  that have this happening in your sleep. what? He was the guy seen me, I have ten years left, he'll see me. My sweet spell the last time he was. When I was growing up, my father kept his letter flight jacket hanging in his paws. Ace of Gunstereon. It really strange to see it unsteady, new toss and slorens. Painting on the back of it are 50 yellow outline pit grass shaped  bombs with fins with a nose side down. Two of these are filled with hash marks. These represent the times we shot down, once nearly in another time over you go slot. Here's what happens second. One inch in with shot out and the other inch in the pit so we bailed out over the Adriatic Sea. Everyone the heat in the pilot drown. My father told me that he tried water and though he's Jewish. She only knew one prayer, Lishamah, and kept her sighting it over and over again. And after six hours, she was rescued by a British native ring. She was only 20 years old and yet three more bombing missions to complete before this ending home. I know these details because I've heard the stories so many times, but there's something different about hearing you tell stories on stage to strangers. the story about how the squadron was supposed to bomb a railroad junction in the town has a coercion. Now, Hatsubah Ozeny, obviously, is not a military target. It's just a little old Hungarian farm in Tom Bidishin, telling him to be a good lady in the state. The Colonel said, when in doubt you all follow targets, just go wrong then. You were 10,000 feet. You brought us down 8,000 feet. And it 8,000 feet with a new and bonsock. You can't miss. You can't miss. What do you mean? And we just blew the hell out of every. We're never going to let you get me done in a street every night. Post every. Next squad in came in. They drop their bombs. We're not going to drop. We're not going to drop their bombs. We're not going to drop their bombs. We're not going to drop their bombs. We're not going to drop. Look, every plane carries 10,000 pounds of bombs. 10,000 times 28, that's  quarter-min and pounds of TNT. Divide that by say 2,500 people, that's  a hundred pounds of TNT for every man child and woman in that building. As it was, me was no more. It was gone. It was my thought to face this earth. It was just a pile of Hungarian and dust, the whole of the ground. What I hear my father taught me stories on stage, I always sent the same thing. After filling up so much space in my imagination, how can I never thought about what it was to create those terrible memories of that inside me? We landed! I got deep breath. I went back to the office, but I was not having the bread. And Captain Bill Carter, the flight attendant, can also... smiles and said, hey, rocket, I just came back when the car offered. The baby's doing great, mother's doing fine, and the car officer happy with hell, they even asked about you. He was in nowhere, was a patriarchal, they knew you would meet Godpard. They looked at me and said, when are you so down in the dumps of them? Is it well, Connor? I'm feeling kind of weird. how less. you went out delivered that baby and I kind of helped and I'm proud of that pun. This morning we went out and I just felt 253,000 people and I helped. Connor what the hell's going on? Is this some kind of insanity? Connor looked at me. Oh, I guess you want me to go nuts? We put the booty hatch. Is that  they are me? No! you would say, you do what I take it in this vime, right? First you follow on it. You do what you've been trained to do. Then when you're done, just forget it, forget it. Just forget it. And that great-grink your drink and drink and drink it, and then you're done having nothing, and nothing. You do that, you'll be all alone. Well, harder was more... I did what he said. I did my best to get. And I pretended. And I denied. And I sure did my share of Britain. I grew up watching my father drinking lab. I've seen him stand. They never been able to do their table. with relatives and friends, and raise a glass of wine and wash it here at slide down the space, as it cries this way through a turfs. I've seen you drink hundreds of times, at celebrations, at satocations, late at night in the kitchen when it was just a unique talk. And I have never thought that when it rings, it's because it's trying to forget something. I never thought about it until I saw him tell other people. I've never thought about it until I saw him tell other people. Thank you, Rockin' and Los Angeles. We're coming up, California Governor Pete Wilson and Mike Rotitz and Super Hero Mask on a wrestling mat. Somebody  up. I'm talking about it anyway. Just a minute, from Public Radio International, we in on-program continues. It's a American line for my class. Each week in our show, of course, we choose a theme and move the idea of different kinds of stores on the internet. Today's program, leave the mask on. It's the stories of those situations where somebody tries to tell you just a little bit more than perhaps you want to know at the outset. We have adapted back to our program, back to Mama Candy Herning. We'll dance to have you try to syndicate it. X developed from the Savage class, if you've seen it at the beginning it's not only more entertaining than most columns of this type, but it's very very explicit, more explicit than I can think of another column as explicit. So explicit actually. There actually have three of fans last three columns here, and there is not a single question or answer from these three columns I can quote to you over the video. I can give a kind of gloss summary of these questions that I can actually get onto public with. video. Today. In real life, Dan will talk the sex about anybody except the one who is speaking. We think we prefer to read from this song. A quick warning before the genie's story. Although there's no nasty language or graphic, sexual moments in this story, Dan does mean a few sex acts. So he says there's nothing more. I'm not here to talk about sex and hear it in a kick and fashion. To share with you the secret shame. sexy person. I cannot talk about sex with my family. Anyone else anywhere else in kind of sex with family I become as a middle sister Laura will not tell you a completely different person. You get out, ooh you're mental sister I don't want to talk to you about sex, back up, who's going to get a little girl with your mind. You say that. Because you do, you get out, ooh you turn off red and you get all high pitched moves and I don't . My parents brought up four kids, three boys, one girl, Lauren and Zlea and us. But I came out to my family Laura was, really. She finally had a sister. Now there was someone in the family she could dish him out for as a member. She was having sex with boys, I was having sex with boys, it'd be perfect sense to her and you could two of us sit up, night, sit around, easy to be very nice. I remember one of those early conversations. My sister cornered me on the front porch. She wanted some oral sex caps. When I realized why she had cornered me on the front door, I wanted to be right back in the house. But considering how well she handled the recent news about my sister community, she didn't seem fair that I should run in and slam the door on her. So though I was dying inside, I shared it with her, I knew at that point about all the sons, and then got the number of girls. So the sex of us in the immediate family? If you were to rank everyone for comfort of talking about sex issues, where would I be? Would I be? At the bottom? I would? You'd be at the bottom? But in the extended family? How would you rank? I mean,  Peggy and Nessder, Amy, Terri, the whole sort of crowd. It's still be closer to the best. I still be closer to the best. Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, no. I'm sure we're my discomfort came from. My parents were open with us about sex. They would use any opportunity that came along to initiate education, conversation with us kids about sex. But I'm not convinced they were open this with entire voices. In the late 70s, moms and dads went to a lot of pressure. I'm talking openly with your teens about sex. I'm just very happy. It's funny how different people offer and shared experiences and vastly different ways. I recall the times when my mother and father talked to us about sex, my parents must've lived in prison. this. They didn't want to talk to us about it. They didn't  talking to us about it. They weren't good at talking about it. But, by God, they were going to hit parents if they still don't know. But maybe I remember those conversations that way because, in fact, I was the one in our hands. My mother remembers this conversation differently. We wanted to talk to about sex, at least I did, I can speak to your family. We thought that in the world, we were going to be these great wonderful, open parents and give you our social information. and you said that we were uncomfortable having a conversation? Well, sometimes you used to cover your ears and say, I had to want to talk about that. Oh, really? I did that, yes. I remember one run from a room conversation. My brother Eddie came down to dinner wearing a t-shirt with an oil sucks in the window, decal ironed onto it. Before of us, kids were snickering, and my parents asked us if we really knew what that t-shirt meant. Then my father explained to us in great detail, all about what it sucks. Us 19 reinventors. I was 13 years old and watching three-scupony in Hollywood squares, I had managed to work out exactly what the sex was all on my nose. I didn't need my father to explain it to me in the mouth and the shepherd's heart. Then mom dropped the ball. There was nothing wrong with what the sex was. So long as the man and woman engaging in it were in love. Why she and my father engaged in what the sex was. I was all I needed to hear to put enough little sex for about 15 years. and Shepherd's heart. Part of my problem with those parrot-kid conversations about sex is a two-vivid imagination. When you're talking about sex in someone's heart not to form mental pictures of them actually having sex. And no one likes to picture their parents having sex. When I answer letters in my column, it's different. I don't know what these people look . I can picture whoever I want. So unless gender comes in the question it's in the theory of way, I picture Matt Damon and Brad Pitt Together In fact, let's all take a moment shall we? Okay, back to the radio show Since I started writing a sex column this thing with the family has gotten worse especially in the mother During the darkest days of the AIDS crisis my mother would really need her Not one sex life asking me the most graphic intense That's probing involved questions. She was absolutely prussed to toward. She wanted to know what sorts of risks I was taking. With whom, how often under what circumstances, how much I had to drink, what this was in tensions toward me were, where he was raised, what his people did, how much little we were using, what kind of condoms we used. Huh? I've had conversations with my mother, not the theory and practice in any sense that I don't many people living or dead, have had with me. List among others. My mother can find me too. We talk about her since last year and I've given her advice. That's as much as I can tell. You and I talk about sex. It seems to me that it's mostly your instigation. Do you think we discuss sex more than grab or mother in some? Probably. I don't really know. Do you talk to my brothers about sex? Not really. I don't talk. very many people about that. She talked a lot of my sister about that. No. But you do talk to me about it. And do you want to know what it is? Because I work in sexers because I'm gay or is it because we're  in sexual and close. I think we've always had different conversations since you were a little person. Our conversations always tend to get more intense. to cover more area. The only time my mother gets upset about our sex conversations is when I'm reproducing one call on it. My mom was very upset. My mom said, , oh, I'm certain that you can paper an article on the towel where she still lives. That first week at Rand there, I mentioned details of what sheep thought was a private conversation we'd had about since many years before. So now when we talk about science, my mother takes me on an author record, highly placed Washington source. Then y'all were off the record, she'll stop. say before we get into a conversation, not an old honest, rather not in having. When the conversation turns back to more mundane things, you'll announce, all right, he we're back on the record. My mom's a regular deep. That's what I came from. Do you think that  when I came out when I liked my whole family as gay, I sort of made sex issue. And we made sexuality and sex issue and sex sexuality in the family. So do you think that's there to be invited? Conversations about sex? Oh, definitely. I think your openness brings it out in a lot of people. And you're so open about it, people don't stop to think that it is a subject that you don't want to discuss, so there are people that you don't want to discuss it. Or that I'm only open about it in your opinion. Mm-hmm. It's a kind of  a prostitute. I don't know if I'd see it again. I would hope that you wouldn't. Good, well I won't. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. You private person is very different than the public person in many areas of the life Don't ruin me. I'm a I got a sweet kid going. I know what it ruined by this interview. Let's it worth no It's not as wrong and I'm carrying as sometimes because Here I told I Here's the worst thing about. Since it's common knowledge now, I'm becoming talking about sex in the family, easy to engage. The best way to tease and then home-crow visit. At a wedding last month, words spread through my immediate antics-ended family, and I interviewed my mom and my sister for this radio show, about how uncomfortable I am talking with my family about sex. People thought that was pretty funny considering what I do from living. the water that came after me. Everybody had a sex question for me that day and some calls me says, nephew's pre-ance siblings that happened couple. My aunt wouldn't let me leave the table until I told her what's this thing. My brother told me all about his last one nighter. I'd  some reoccurring nightmare. The female cousin, the same age as my sister, was that night on the porch, cornered me at the bar and asked for oral sex appointment. By the time I sat in the world, cousin Chris insisted on showing me his nipple. means I was in hell. When I complained to my mother, she told me to stop whining. Then she asked me a sex question herself. I'll tell you what her question was, but mom didn't have to record it. Thanks for your time. ife isn't a day rest hours in jail mhm at dream then masking when other storymicida of some pa did  from this says you on questioning college whoimiastic very well. This can wrestling matches known as Roochelle E-Brag, which roughly translates to Free Fight. Are they Smith's? Something about a mask makes a man brazen. That's the thing Tommy blew taught me. The Tommy blew was the first Mexican wrestler I met. Picture a man in the skull hugging blue mask, an atom drawn across the forehead, not to mention his mad helmet black turtleneck, black jeans, pre-jacket and really fine other shoes. If a Tommy blew had a cold ring, he'd be encrypting. If he had a month. he'd be inviting. He's bad. It's a time of glory taught me that Mexican wrestling is not just a sport, which are liberators in art form, a tradition, a pattern of good versus evil. Which are liberators, a time of glory said, is religion. The Bible, the up-to-rare law control, the greatest of all wrestling heroes was El Santo, the same. Who not only father and ring, but I'm a screen. From the 40th. down in the present, dozens of wrestling stars and played in hundreds of incredibly strange movies, wrapping their limbs around plot devices pride from horror, crime and science fiction genres. Santo might easily break up a spiring, pitch woo with a backseat full of chicas, and defeat Martians all in the same picture. Santo did everything without removing his disguise, even when he directed his pictures, even when he was buried with 1934, Mexico seemed always kept his most stunning. When a parking lot behind the inner-harm swap meet, every weekend they pull a plastic tarp off a regulation ring, set up metal bleachers, it's $10 for adults and bricks. planning of kids. About 50 fans around the ring this afternoon. Shooting star wears a black man's orange bolt's creases temples. In the chaleigh brain there are good guys known as techniqueos, in bad guys, noodles, guess which one shooting star is. What the fuck are you guys doing huh? Every time he yells, USA fans scream back in Mexico. Shooting star preings before the hostile crowd, the issues challenges to his opponent, to the fans, and it seems maybe even to God. It's getting ugly. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. in Spanish shooting star calls the headquarters 30 wet pounds asks if their citizens of the US . It seems  everything Mexican culture, people's worries and fears plays out in the mean. So it's no surprise that there's a wrestler who's the equivalent of the masked-gabbing Pete Wilson, Penn Bad Guy, haunting the immigrants in crown. What happens in Mexican life happens again. But what's the people's challenges now. A couple of years ago, when reports of blood sucking creature feasting on farm admins first shocking to the coast, the New Westland star called the Goat Sucker, suddenly appeared. Other heroes include wrestling priests and social workers. At today's match, one of the luchidores was named El Cholo, a wrestler dressed as a gang band in the sighty pants and colors, flashing game signs. The luchidore reaches back to prehistoric mass religious rituals and the neck and knees, this moment. Many of the points out have a swab, pipe smoking, skin-ass, submen, markers, leader of these apatista rebels in northern Mexico, calculated to be a most of the image of El Santo. It is if Hulk Hogan somehow carried a huge form over terms again and again, be in Martin Luther King. This is the power of the Master. It makes superheroes out of die-curders, mechanics, gardeners, and in a high-might eating metal wrestler who is a care-repractice. In the ring you're character in the LG, Buyers' hand-pals and performs a movie call to the magic lamp. During the week, the tall, easy man who black-poonyed in is a colorful scene. When I'm going to start a little bit of this. It was hard to get back to what I did to be a force because I would miss being out there being the super star. I miss it but in our culture, in the mixing culture, you get a lot of respect. For example, every time I go to Mexico or I go out and I go to a dance or something, I get specificity. I get me a table and they treat me to brings them. , it's kind of funny, because that's how people are. As soon as you put on the mass-mars, you feel  a poor little person. If you're a hero, which is a bad guy, , all of a sudden you feel this urge to play, to play, to play, to play. And, , when you're a good guy, you feel  you guys gonna save the world. it's funny and it happens. What's a limitation master of Lering and let you take it off for this is  a deviation. You're getting late and what's a limitation master of  whoever loses a match has to take off their match and never risked over this. It happens to me. It happens to me. I went against one of the top bristles next. and I lost it in Mexico against Fishman. He was in the fishman and he was my idol. I said, what's growing up? He came to a head, we had a Bible read, and we went to a house and we got the very point. That's the biggest relation you can see in the ring. Lucy, you're nice. I saw it once and I'll never forget. It happened last spring. And so we... After all, the dreams of masked men, wrestlers, hockey goals, and guys and kiss. It was the last match of the night. Bulldog Rivera versus Shemun Jr. Shemun was a pudgy technical. Nobody had to wonder how he got in the Shemun. No wonder about the whale-appin case decorated his aqua bell of humas. If white was even for a while, and then, Bulldog climbs the ropes. It leaves a Shemun Jr. torso, and knocks him to his knees. in- for smeuding the wrong times?​ Shame on you in the end scene, of losing some sense, out of the same scene​ I had some trouble appearing on a whole week,​ I thought I'd never do the game.​ I'd never revealed this game,​ and people were ideological,​ for getting me right aware of this, I had lost and it worked as much harm as if it had really come true.​ And it felt, I mean, I tried to stop the rig, I tried. when I left my mask . It was something, since hard to describe, but it was a feeling of, which is, I fell alone, because I was so alone. , but, , the night, my son, one of my sons was there, and he came up with a ring, and he gave me a hug, and he fell, he fell, he fell, he fell, he fell, he fell, that better. And he said, , this words, he said, , that is just the mask, . The unmasking is the most sacramental moment. And over the next few minutes, Bulldog returns to the act of will, almost timidly unmasking the shemmly junior feudal exists. He's head cradled in Bulldog's lap, shemmly junior pleas and de-reft. But then, Bulldog sends the ref-splowing to the kick. There was no hope now. I'm security man, I was streaming a late evening 40s with a die job. All around is a call from leg. An act of lyric defines Shamu Jr. undas the rest of his own pieces and flings his mask and his opponent. He is utterly humiliating. Listen to your masks  losing an ego, man who, superpowers, and since fans to the turn I knew you're opportunity to meet Cash Off and Books. He buries his face. his hands fighting off poor dogs, broken fingers, finally, poor dog, prized nation's hands and we see his face. To grade it without the mask, it's just a guy.
