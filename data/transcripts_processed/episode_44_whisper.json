And of course, big platter, drumsticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry relish on the side. When Danielle's family, they didn't eat for the meal. She told me to find her something. They didn't eat for the meal. Well, if WBE is easy Chicago, this is American live. Special program today on the wonders of pitch. Alright, actually we can, we can say the word here. In the word is poultry. And as you probably know each week in our program, we choose something, but it's variety, it's writers, performers, documentaries, producers to tackle that theme. And this week is WBE. all of us, standing that magical five-week period, that magical interregnum between the Turkey of Thanksgiving and the Turkey of Christmas, that magical five weeks where Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the Turkey we consume over the course of the year, 67 million turkeys. So in this period, we bring you our annual poultry slam. We will poultry slam. Stories about turkeys chicken. and stuck's fowl about kind and their mysterious hold of Ross. My regular glass, coming up in the sour at one, duckie, at two, turkey, at three, ready to David Sidarris, at four, sat that we can chicken blood. And of course, of course, what hold tree positive? program would be complete without. Yes indeed in the late 1960s the Winged Warrior Chicken Man's Structurer and the hearts of people doers on radio is all across our great nation. And today we are pleased to bring you the first new episode of Chicken Man since 1969. This is one of the things if you have heard chicken man this needs no introduction. If you haven't, you are in for a big treat, a big radio treat. It's a letter in the show. Stay with us. Heck one. Becky. So in Daniel's family, power of culture is so great. No, guys. But when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it, that's right. And they call it that for a reason. And the reason has to do with his stuff. and puppet called Ducky. But then, Yel, he's nearly 30 years old. Sister Ashley is two years younger. And Ducky's been in the family since they were children. Well, he was a Christmas private when I was about eight. I was about 10. And when he first arrived, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful fluffy way back. And he had a cape on and black kind of... Dylan's flat hero, goggles, he lost, he lost the outfit pretty quickly, anyone make it. And then he became asked if he was the occult for a short break. That's not unusual for older siblings to dominate young clients. And his children, Danielle, down late, ask. That's it with me. up to Daniel, bought together a tensioner or approval. Daniel, always, always got her way. Except when ducking the square. Basically, I actually would channel. I mean, it's kind of an anacronism in this context, but she would channel that she would become, that she's wish you would speak as duckie. And duckie was sarcastic. I said, duckie was selfish, boss. Duckie would insult them. I know. I do a tease Danielle. I do a different people. No, sweet. Whatever Ashley kind of brought back into the equation, speak you completely, the dump, and for it. I was just cutting that shit. I mean, I just got to compare his personality with her. Ashley's personality? , I should say I kind of consider it, I'm very, very, very, very sensitive. people. Very very explained about I think what happy a woman out doesn't feel good or and that he is totally , , what's for lunch attitude? what's in it for me, in your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggard and a total whim. He's both both and they. He's just indomitable, yeah, indomitable spirit. When 19 years after Ducky arrived in the matoon household, the fluffy whiteness is long gone. The fluffy effect is not a word you really used to describe Ducky. Nor is too wide, remember correctly. This physical, , what he looked  physical, kind of, he's really the headache looking gray. The father said, very terrible. Very sadder. But then the fact that his brain, , , what's coming out of his mouth completely is incomplete in a aisle about who he actually is. I don't know, there's just something really, really great about that. In really, you have to love and love him for it. Thank you. Alright, I've been a Danielle's apartment sometimes, and I've witnessed the thought which is a picture, please. Danielle is not spoken with her sister in weeks. She picks up a phone, calls Ashley and Mithigan. Ashley answers. Danielle has immediately, can you put duck york? And then Ashley essentially, , becomes duckie, puts duckie on the phone. Danielle talks 15, 20 minutes. And both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are, Daniel is an editor at a Big New York Magazine. I adore that key. I really love that key. Sometimes I think, , if he disappeared, it would really feel  someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really kind of old and rattly. And it really makes me sad. I feel , I mean, it... I mean, it really makes me sad to think about a girl's about that piano, it would be a big empty hole in the world. He kind of takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if he if something happened to him, , if he would lost an airport or kind of run of a guy, I would be a little guilty hard break. So I hope it's a... I mean clear. Why? If you're dinner in the home with Danielle's family. Is this serving some kind of coach? , chicken or turkey. If you ask anybody in the family. What's within? They'll tell you. Yes. Right. And the rationale for that is, is what? Fix the key out. It freaks them out though. Because you don't  him to know that perhaps some birds are already there. I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. So even denial about most things. about the fact that he's totally  a week in tiny and dirty he thinks he's really good looking and strong and ladies really smart and so that a friend. Right. So I think the Nile about the fact that he's actually stopped. I can see it. Something that's not nice, I think that's it. IT's stuck. We got no way. I thought I would try to book Ducky. It's come on the radio program. So I contacted Danielle Sister Ashley and asked her, , Good Ducky coming in there. I received an answer back. How I found the fight of electronic mail. That for Ducky to appear, I'd have to first go through someone named Yona Liu who I could reach through. Danielle and Ashley's mother. When I talk to Danielle, I asked her about this. I've been informed that the only way that I could reach in is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lou, you have that name right? Yona Lou, yeah. I think that's what she's asking us with A-chan. Yona Lou is. She's ahead top. Anything special that I should say to Yona Lou to make it. What she? I mean, I don't know. She's a pretty hard bar again. Hey Mrs. Métin. Yes. It's I request. Hey I request. Mrs. Métin. Here's where I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio of that duck. Duckie. And I contacted your daughter Ashley. And she said that for me to look duckie onto my radio show. I was going to personally contact Yona Wu. Yeah, you wouldn't need to do that. And that I need to do that too. Yeah, who is Yona Will? Yona Lue is, she's kind of up. She's a hedgehog, she's basically taken charge of Duffy's financial affairs. I presume it's a time to do it's money. Well, I don't know actually. I mean, that's probably why she said contact law. Well, so what do I do now? I'm calling you, she said I was called to contact you and if I wanted to get him to touch him, he'd be on a win-or-a-dip. book that is what I do next. You're going to book that. That's how I did when I book that. So. Well, I'll just talk to you a little about it. She says, OK, OK. I mean, we're going to read one of this guy's terms or something. She didn't talk. So what's all right? Should I call you back? You could call me back or I just go in and go in and go in and go in. Yeah, you're just going to chat. Yeah, should I wait? Yeah, all right, I wait Yeah, yeah, this is just radio. Yeah, not TV. It's just radio And nobody's gonna get to be on TV No, no one's gonna be on TV. No, it's strictly radio Okay, , it doesn't care what happens to him. What if it were to you? I think she'd want to be on too. Leave me that shit out. I mean, radio doesn't do much for her, just hot. Alright. As you might imagine, not everybody in the family takes all this so lightly. Daniel's father was never too, , he was. He was quite actually bothered by the whole E. We maybe had a problem with the family. Really? I mean, for a while, we had two daughters only communicated through a doc. Yeah, that period that you're describing, what Wendy needs? I would say that maybe for 10 and 12 or 9 and 11. And they would only communicate through the doc? Well, Danielle did pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley, but she paid quite a lot of attention We could say the question to each other If we could take you out of the grammar, there's going to be a lot of attention, it's going to happen We're fighting about 10 times we're going to first go back and learn more about this, We are there once and for all, we're staying at Marley's school, and will think about that one more way. But let's get a little closer to that one, こちら once or I will help them continue working outside the hospital. We're always playing some music, it'll go in until they get to the grid already. up. So we've actually wanted to get Danielle's attention. All she had to do is rev up the duck. They're Helen, do this one. I can't remember. She also made Danielle laugh that way. Danielle thought that he was very funny, but I can't remember her. Ashie. In toast. of the relationship between my sister and me. I don't know why. I mean, I've reached really sick, but I have so much kind of genuine affection and love for dockey that it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings in a way that it's not a easy to kind of demonstrate those feelings toward my sister because we never kind of got in habit of it. What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with dockey? Well, a really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Ducky, but I think as we've gotten on older and older we've got more and more of a more and more focused about the Ducky factor in our relationship. And I think I think kind of a big cup. I mean, it definitely kind of gives me the vision into her brain that I wouldn't have otherwise. Well, I did finally snagging interview with Duckie. , big, big, netward radio program that we are. We could pull off this coup. Snagged for you, this interview with an imaginary hand puppet. Anyway, did I make this happen by calling Ashley? Is Duckie still up for this? Yeah, he just got back from a time . He just got back from a party. Yeah. He was at a happy hour thing. On the... Right. I wrote with a lot of... College of Dudes. Didn't I encourage that he knew a dancer? A lot of his friends go to this happy hour. I'm glad you did. All right. Could you get him? Ah, sure. He's a friend. Great. Hey, Ducky. Yeah? Hey, how are you doing? I'm just fine. No time to see. Long time no see. Back back at you. And work, welcome to her. a radio program. Well we actually have a number of different people. It's just  conference. Yeah. The Dougie, I was talking to Danielle for a radio program. I had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn't , you could pretty much control her with something called nose. squeaks. Yeah. She has this kind of a prominent note. I mean, I've stuck out and just went away. I've always been always Thanksgiving or watching her mother child. Yeah. And this video has helped and she reminded me a lot of me. Oh, Danielle. Yeah. And comment told Miss Piggy, move the clock and tell us how you  and move the clock away. And what she moved? Yes, she Yeah. Now a fire with Teller which has also. It's done in the caption, say the Danielle moves the poor. What would the effect of that day? Ah, kind of, ,  me, I,  how she looks at you when she doesn't approve of something that I or Joe, she gets this half ice-cold there and gives you the side-long answer to make you kind of feel you're about the side-to-up piece. Yeah. That's what she says. Is there anything about the life of her? of a doc that perhaps you could tell already on the Insta, but we might not know. I'm sure that  much more about it than me, dear. No, sorry. I'm not really in touch with a whole doc. You're an attention-holseeing, dear. When I had time, I used to migrate once in a while, because I had some time to adapt. And the time I see touch with them, but right now, it just starts  more time,  people, and still am I on the same thing, and I just... sometimes I don't have time to do time stuff and things more. I just want to know my life for now. If you're willing to down to new Orleans, did you understand his quote I mean? I all do the weed, just why I'm as a mouse, but I don't tell him that I can go from house to house. You don't have the paid to use your patience. If you were to cook on a waiter or a good meal session. So if... If you have to be just classin' by stopping at Saturday night fish right, but I'm rocking, I'm rocking, you haven't seen sex covered and she'll be down the rate of dollars. You ain't rocking, I'm rocking, you haven't seen sex covered and she'll be down the rate of dollars. Then the two was to jail and the day is to be patient. The book each one of us all suspicion. But you came down and went my bayonet, I thought you'd come running down the sales window, but I didn't ask her to find her. That rock is j-y-y. Now you can't be able to get a fist in your eyes. Just mention a sadder than night fish rocks. I don't care how many fish you should see. But don't you ever mention fish to me? It was rockin'. It was rockin'. Can't have a seat, say stop an inch of a down break of dollars. It was rockin'. It was rockin'. Well, the story of a 27-year-old graduate student. I'll suck it down. Naturally brings the story up.

Well, coming up, I'll be going to real Turkey Farm, David Sedaris, and of course, the first new episode of Chicken Man since the Nixon administration written just for our program. That's all on a minute. when it comes. It's a American life, my or glass. Each week on a program of course, which is topic, where you documentary a short fiction, found tape, anything we can think of on that thing. Today, with the Turkey of Thanksgiving, just behind us, the Turkey of Christmas headed us, we're in that Turkey sandwich, part of the year, . We are in the middle of it. We are at the center of that sandwich. And in honor of that, we're holding our. Annual poultry. The day before the night, 3,000 turkeys die, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range. This requires some explanation. Turkey spent their first 16 weeks in a heated brood or house. Then they are put outside to range and fenced in closures. Visually men and trucks help take into the range of night. This time Daddy decided we'd heard them ourselves. It looked simple enough. We made a temporary shoot of wirefins ran from the double indoors of brood or house, 50 yards to the hand. We would get behind the turkeys in the brood or house, shout, wave old shirts and guinea and set them. They would run out the doors through the shoot and into the wind. And that's the way it worked in the first Brutor house. First Turkey's hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved to the shoot and dispersed. The rest followed, it took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. Let's work straight through he said, we'll be done by him. By the time Turkey's been in the Brutor house, we see. 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles and dust. The stench is overframing. After an hour in the breeder house, your lungs hurt for a day. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny, barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung never let go. We didn't felt that. We move the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was nine in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that have never seen direct sunlight. The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to act. I've seen turkeys clamor against a fence trying to get into a range of fire. I've seen them rush toward a screaming child trying to kill it. And I've seen them run from a screaming child, spooked and terrified. These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was  an old adventure movie, where the walls are closing in, but there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight, which the turkeys could not touch. We yelled louder. Wait, dire. cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the log jam at the pot. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with his legs, forcing them into the sun. Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each. other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time daddy can get the doors closed, at least a thousand turkeys are escaped and were running free on the farm. On to our neighbor's farm, into the road. We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for it happening at own the factory, feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys. process in plant. We got a portion of the profits. If there were profits. With a thousand turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this block. 16 weeks of daddy working 14 hour days. Up my sisters and they working alongside him. Anytime we weren't in school, all for no pay. And if we weren't paid for this block, we would have no cash coming in until the next block was raised. It took us eight hours to round up the escape turkeys. Poor Obvious trying to track down a thousand birds that had the whole world in which tied and run from us. The sun beat down and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister Billy, the youngest Obvious, just 11, bombeted from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours, sun, heat and dehydration. As she lay up. On the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one to sit, teen. But even she was not to sit. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on. You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls that. Are you making I'm exaggerating? That's self pity. has magnified our distress. I tell you this is no exaggeration. And I tell you my father had an urge for us. Or any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unremel. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had down to us. I couldn't afford niggers to her sister. So I had to. at 6 o'clock we rebuilt the shoot. We opened the doors in the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low behind them walked through to the pan. We cleaned up, we ate supper, and we went to bed. That's the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys took. At midnight mother woke us up. We had to get to the pan, daddy needs us. We had been too exhausted to hear. the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them. One at the end. When people learn I grew up on a turkeys farm, they invariably ask, is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths and rain? Look up at the sky and brown. The answer is yes. Sum up. can do that. They are that stupid. But that's not how 3,000 dying one night. They die because they are scared and they huddles together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close to fine protection mass bodies. And they subject. We called it highly. It wasn't unusual for a loud noise. cause a pile in the breeder house. If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed the door. But this was worse than any pile we'd seen. Turbys who'd never spent a night outdoors, panic, fight thunder, enlightening, and rain in sheets. All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the food. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soap turkeys. Throwing them, grabbing some more, you don't know if the ones you were throwing your dead are alive. You don't care. Maybe we save some. The next day the sky was cloudless and the sun board down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys throwing them onto the back of a flat bed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a turkey old park in the house. 3000 dead turkeys. sitting in the Missouri sun for two days. The company that owned the turkeys had been insured against acts of God, so we couldn't do anything until the insurance inspector had seen them. He came, a man from town in a white shirt and tie, who held his handkerchief over his face when he got close to the truck. He made no pretense of counting, just of there. After he left, Daddy shoveled for turkeys into dead turkey gulch. He quert gasoline on the moon struck a match. He burned for days. Do we show what to do with the Chicago area? She says she's still his turkey. Twice a year. She has just finished a novel called Needlework for a publisher. It's a thing you gotta get in. Think of it, think of it. Think of it, think of it. Think of it, think of it. Think of it, think of it. What David said. There is a commentator, an NPR is morning edition, the author of the book Barrel Fever and the forthcoming book naked, and he contributed to following story to our poetry slam. It's an excerpt from his diary. July 19, 1992. This afternoon at the 26th Street flea market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop  Ghostry Shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name. I pass the view. usual objects, grinning man-mees offering themselves off the salt-paper-shakers. The coffee table made from dice, and other head carved from a coconut. That's collectible, the deal of say, referring to an ash tray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet ball. Collectible to who? Last weekend at the flea market I saw this thing. A tax it earned me turkey's head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that its velocity. the top of its feet can fell towards me. Stiff red hairs stood out from the head and shoulders in the claws were really sharp. You think that something armed  that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a choppy block saying, I know I'll take the turkeys head and attach it to the foot. Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead might enable you to? make this connection. I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. $45 a deal I said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. I'll write she said $35, $30, which she could have borne up. All right, $85, $120, $370. I had no choice but to follow wherever she left. I handed over my wallet and a chance. Just gave it to her. Thank you she could take the whole thing, cash, blank checks, library card, whatever take it off. I stared into the face of this taxidermy turkey's heading up in the announcement. Tomorrow? What's that? Yesterday doesn't kill. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own. On the way home I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, I'll give you a hundred? No, five hundred thousand dollars. Guess what I've got. in this paper set. And I swear that not one of them would have come up with my dancing. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square on the eye, thinking, sucker. David Cedera's Slows in New York City, staged adaptation of this Sandaland diaries is not the Atlantic Theater, and then happened. Thank you for coming. How WBEC radio our offices are closed. to observe holiday. If  you please enter your mailbox number. Please enter your security code. Greetings is on. You have one new and one saved message to listen. Press five. Brett. Hi, I read this is Michael and South Africa. Listen about the item that we spoke about the turkeys head attached to the turkeys foot. When I spoke to some of the sand gumas which are which is repeated onround now. about that thing and they've never heard of anything quite  it or seen anything quite it. However, when I would describe it to them, their jaw has dropped. I've been looking, I discovered a whole bunch about poultry in South Africa. So, call me back. Okay? Michael is Michael Stum, a former actor, former member of the Worst or Group in New York City. For me, should cago in that listen to your pants first. South Africa. And I asked him to go into the uses of chicken. Another poultry among the Sangloma culture in South Africa. Sanglomas or witch doctors or herbalists or or readers you hear them called sometimes. They're common in South Africa. Everybody seems to know one. And chickens are one of their main tools. Well, it's a funny thing. I discovered that over half the country is just a wash in chicken but it's it's a sub. that is it comes in so handy. It's rather , gosh, I don't know, it flows  milk. It does an America or Dr. Bronner's gamma mile. So, for some other, easily, easily, still liquid in modern America. It's an incredibly versatile product. You can lose that luck with it. You can strengthen our folky muscle with it. You can improve your eyesight with it. You can find it one, size. and the clip and you can get your white back with it. You can transfer your bad luck to someone else with it. I mean, I had someone tell me that there is a ceremony involving the killing of a chicken or a broken man or which I'll describe to you. But this is a very specific ceremony that involves losing your court paper at court. In other words, if you do this thing with this chicken, the court will lose the papers and that's how you will go free. Allow me to describe the ceremony and sure because . I'm sure many of our listeners get into these kinds of situations and I wonder, how can we make, for example, the U.S. District Attorney simply lose that file. Yeah. You are arrested. A court date is set. You then, you go home to your witch doctor. You bring him a white chick. It has to be a white chick. The witch doctor then prescribes some mootie, which is medicine. You can come in many, many forms. Perhaps it's a powder, perhaps it's a liquid. It doesn't really matter. you're going to take the mood to yourself. You then take the chicken and the mochi a two-the nearest mountain. You climb to the top of the mountain. You dig a hole. You dig a hole, large enough for the chicken to fit in. You then speak to the chicken. You say to the chicken, this is what I want to have happen. I would  my United States Federal Court tax document, file number 86902B, to disappear. Or whatever it is that you want to disappear. You then take a large sewing needle, and you poke the chicken's eyes out with this sewing needle. You then, I'm very the chicken. Blind, now blind, chicken, alive, in the hole. You put them in all you put the dirt back on. Then this chicken is going to do something for you in the after world. After you've hooked at its eyes and you're bearing it alive, this chicken is going to do you a favor and then the mystic spirits? Magic is funny, I wrote, what can I say? It's essentially at the end of the ceremony. You leave the chicken and then you go. Then as it was described to me, you go back to your court. on the day of your court date and your papers will be lost. People will say, you have no papers, you are free. I believe I will describe to me. Now, Mr. Stom, in the interest of your report, have you talked to anyone who claims that this worked for them personally? Well, the gentleman I spoke to, I'm true. The gentleman I spoke to, ... has heard of this work he has not actually been arrested himself and caused his favorite disappear in this manner. But apparently there are gang chicken wrestlers here, , not unlike cattle wrestling in them, , in Western movies. You're maybe in this house. Chicken wrestlers. We're not a chicken wrestlers, I swear. What kind of dignity is there in that fort for a man? Let me just ask you that, ,  a man, you can wrestling some Yeah, you wrestles some cattle and you feel  a man, but you wrestled a chicken. The word Russell doesn't even seem  it's the right word. It's just, , it's just too big a word. It's too grand a word. You don't hear the strains of Aaron Copeland on the word Russell. , it comes up next to the word chick. How'd it for a second? Let me just, I'm just going to put on some Aaron Copeland here right now. I just want you to enjoy a scene of the chicken wrestlers. Can you just describe what, how you picture it? Imit ==== The music's going now. Well, I think, , as I picture a chicken russ, let's say probably wait till the time goes down. And then they probably have a sack because if you stick a chicken in a sack, you your she is not going to. So they probably chuck a bunch of chickens in the sack. And as many as they can get away with until the chickens who are not in the sack start making noise. And then they run away. a That's how I envision a chicken breast. A chicken broth. Michael, do chicken wrestlers ever get wrestled themselves? And he's  a mafia where it goes back and forth, back and forth. And it ended with Cycle of Islands and wrestling.

As a child, I did not care about the radio. In fact, I had to say that there was only one thing that I remember hearing on the radio. I'll be till the age of 16, and say, and that was chitin'.
