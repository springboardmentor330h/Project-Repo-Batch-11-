I'm Eric Glass, each week on this radio program which is some topic bringing you a variety of stories on that topic. Today's program, welcome to America. Stories of people arriving here, how they see us, but we think they should see us, and what they know about us that we don't necessarily know about ourselves. At one, put to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sidman Freud having common, to a story of a group of Australians, continue to city to teach and publish. high schools and how they're explained in this era is nothing , but American seem to think it will be, back to our movies, stronger than communism, the man flees Cuba, from St. America, always properly regrets it, his son and borrower plots with bipartisan projectship, consuming the right thing, ACOne, quick Arnold Schwarzenegger and Simon Freud had in common. With a new York City public schools, consist of roughly 65,000 teachers, 1.1 million students. And the new York City public schools could not find enough math and science teachers for its classrooms. There's a short, American somehow do not want these jobs. Nemo, European nation of Austria, there was a surplus of math and science teachers. Somebody who noticed these two facts, and went to another. Before long, there was a decision to import Austrian teaching. to New York City. This summer, School Officials began the hiring process, the job interviews that they conducted by video conferencing from the City College in Harlem and Vienna. Better David Lackoff has this account and the Austrian's Welcome to America, and of the partitudes about this country that people could find the post-connone. Any job interviews, nor for the fair. Any job interviews with the panel, five interviews, and more. How about a job interview with the panel of five interviews conducted? foreign language, via trans-bentic live video talking from same complete with an echo in audio domain, with reporters from nightline, the local TV news in New York's major daily spot. To the young men busy with the tape up in purple, city college bandwidth packed and tight for the news term is been fair. Everyone is nervous, questions are repeated, so down, it all makes for very hot-game progress. To the question, would you please tell us why you have decided to become a teacher? I'm sorry, it's very hard to hear. I didn't understand you. Please ask again the question, please. How much of an actual cultural gap is everything concerned? Well, when asked what knowledge they have of New York schools, one woman answered that she heard, quote, the kids were having guns and using drugs. But she doesn't remember the concern. It becomes proved that the Austrian teachers are helping to come to New York ever since with bench, experience another culture firsthand and can prove their inch to the public with most of them. That's be quite well. One fellow, hundreds from New York, small day, I think, to say, I want to see the blacks where I am from there is only one black people who won't sound  it's a... wine, gurrante. Three of them went ask why they became teachers, innocently in unabashedly answer because I love children. I don't know the American male would answer, but it's too mean that way. Even if it were to you. The final question has them all completely styling. Can you tell us anything else about yourself that you'd make us want to select you as one of our teachers? Answering this kind of question, this kind of question is... required skill even for Americans. You remember how it took at least three job interviews before you learned that maintaining unwavering eye contact and being hypothetically gung-ho, weren't just weird and arrogant. They were required. For the Austrian's trained in a kind of court-rewered human reserve, being asked to assert their stern qualities in full voice seems truly baffled. A trick question straight out of all of someone. The best answer comes from the day. with her doctorate in genetics at age 28, perfect English and blonde movies star beauty. She has all of us, educators and reporters alike immediately in the film being a slave. This being a high school world that I've entered on this day, I am hyper-attuned to adolescent paradox and she seems to be that rarest of legendary creatures in the high school parents. The popular girl beloved by students and faculty alike who in addition to being pretty and smart is awesome nights. She's a dressed as doctor. your younger. Scaresly four minutes into her interview the burrow superintendents are mouthing out of camera range. When asked her final tell us why you're the best question, she answers, I don't know if I'm very best, but I'm doing this. And if that's not enough, I would do much better. We would follow her into the very mouth of the hell, seeing sounds all the bottom. So pen says one thing interviews after she is left the room in the end. Let's play a word association there. One, Austrian teacher, association. That extraordinary opening shot. A camera impossible placed in the Alpine ether, coming in effort closer to the mountain top to finally focus and settle on the turning figure her arms out stretched face, beaming overwhelmed with joy and music the young novice at Freylai Marie. The sound of music, Maria Vontrap, Julie Anders, as Seemham television so many times that anyone can complete the following sentence, how do you solve a problem ? 2. New York City Public Schools Association Middle Detectors, Baggy Jeans, Boss guns, White Sly, a futile underfund. in effect, so I decided to let the last stop before entering the revolving art prison system. In part it is these exact stereotypes, the Gileist defenseless foreigners being used for target practice by young tuffs that have so peaked the interest of the national media. And it is these very stereotypes that I will find debunk the time to get into the next five months. The reporter from ABC asks all the questions that are on the minds. those of us not in public education. They are verbating. New York is one of the toughest places to teach in this country. Are you up for the challenge? New York is a very diverse city in their students from various different countries and all of us anywhere you teach you'll find students in various backgrounds, various ethnicities. Is that going to be very different for you? that I've heard about a string of rather unfortunate incidents we've had in the past school year. Students shooting other students in school. Are you aware of that and did that at all effect your decision to? all of this takes place at City College, where for generations immigrants made their starting this country. And all of this takes place in New York, a city which had not a chance of the much-publicized school shooting experience of the past year. The posters in the California lounge at the Delta Terminal of Kennedy are a paradox of great, of London, Paris and Amsterdam. Perhaps the only thing that seems authentically California, to me, about California lounge, is how boring things. I am 13 avid newsman, but wait for the Austrians to get some costumes. The teachers union has issued this dead pound statement. Quart. We're pleased there here, but it's regrettable that the York doesn't pay its teachings more. The starting salary for a teacher in New York City is $29,600, which is a living wage in this town, but not fat city, I have an interest. Those same two young men from City College come in with that same purple banner and try to take it up on wall to know of Ael. When eventually the teachers arrive, my heart races a bit, as if having the presence of major celebrities. This is especially true when I see Andrea. I'm also shocked by how young they all look. They're all in the 20th. The snug trigger. This is my fear for me, just listening to the different ways of the public. My name is Andrew Anger. How do you feel to be here? It's absolutely great and I'm absolutely all world but the interest of the presence of the friendliness of the people. It's great. Where are you going to be teaching? Where will you be teaching? I will be teaching in Brooklyn at the Franklin D. Ruswant High School. This is the Nasswan. , I was just trying to do a scarf in about it. It's half four thousand. Yes. Thank you. I think the Franklin Roosevelt High School is going to be a completely interesting experience for you. But I'm in it, I'm sorry. Andrea, I'm three other of the 26 Austrian teachers. Loads of the whole singer, Elkie Rogo, in Nicholas Etold, are all assigned to teach at FDR. I decide five years later. My name is Nicholas Etold. And where were you with teaching? I would be. each methamathetic where in Brooklyn FDR high school. So you're one of the four Brooklyn yes and she'll any thoughts about what it is you're about to embark on. I want to just look what happens. I know about the school I've heard that it's a huge it's 4,400 This is one of our castings as New Yorkers when we welcome the Farms to our shores. Because we are so often frightened by living here, we are annoyed and offended when visitors feel the show the proper sense of terror, so we try to scare the living day light up. And if a bleak auguries of physical paranormal work, well then we can always talk about that meant. I want to live together with some cooking dishes here, because it's a low cost. Yeah, it's a particularly expensive time and New York's name, right? friends are telling them to... I'm not even a little bit. Luckily enough for the Austrian teachers, their introduction to life in New York City and its public school system will not be left up to the paranoid hysteria from likes of me, the other members of the state. the news cameraman who, upon hearing that there will be teaching high school resources asking when I went in particular, you may buddy know per writing. They will instead sit through a series of days long orientation sessions at the bottom of that, where they will be turned into fully functioning New York. with census 30 numbers in bank account. The bank accounts courtesy of missing a bunch of actual names represented in the case of an open bank. They are taught hand-right checks. Don't they have checks in Australia? They have a law of law of law. The decision now is not just to want. At these sessions they're taught that the United States is free country. They're taught that they don't have to register the de-means for every day live. They're taught that when they apply for a driver's license they won't actually have to no help. fixing engine instead of the most. They're told that in New York, which was used modern-fetched components, unlike it is implied in Boston. The New York educators warned them time and again and again that the dangers of the dreaded chalk in the chalk that drives most out-moving to turn into pyridic art. Reverend Stance of the chalkboard lectures, made the gross and diagrams, but has no capacity to feel inquiry related to scuffer. The underlying messages, to them, you're not in class. I  to talk to my people about heating the ground running, but they're doing the walk. That's what you do. You're in there very quickly. Ladies and gentleman, we're back to your workshop. What I mean by that is establish yourself as I'm sure this will be safe. I need you. Can you move on? One of the more useful moments in Holy Orientation and one that reminds me of why I think I hear it comes when we lost the intimate action in the occident high school. This communication is... is very essential to learning process between you and the students, the following, which are being passed out of our works, then you will hear us used to address our fear and to address some of the teachers also. And while we will be teaching you, we will be teaching you how to manage. They run through their flashcards, found whatever's planned at the bottom, jigging, fat, you're brought in the play yourself. The lesson in slang continues just a few days. later in a weekly class about life in the city. It is being called New York 101 by the media. Although no one out of the media seems to have a name for it. They just call it what the media are calling the new York 101. The professor, a retired English scholar, made a book and that's been the first 20 minutes of the first class, quizzing them on their various subway, some telling them to pick around their business. It is one of the darkest favorite pasts, one on nothing the best subway, is to get to the first. As the other New York, in the room, emphasinate, which happened with the system. and chiming at one point about the long underground transfer between the four five and the two three at foureenth string.

This glass we in New York Market has words in Fresersland, 86, Schmier, Bimba, Mav, Guatemala, Chomp, Leather, and schlepping all over town, we can freeze in Chomp's. All of which would be very used. If it were 1949, if you were a hard-boiled Fudy-Py-Gan-Mol, or in the USA, or even around the block-dish waterblown waitress by a private tick, anyone from a Damon Remian's story or auditioning for sign. What becomes evident over the course of the orientation is that the Austrians are also being given an unveranished glimpse of the Adon and Whitting One, which what it is truly to be a student in publicized within North America. The fourthным Fudy-Py-Gan is the Reserved Rest poor lecture frequently drowning and frequently about seeing the same one never need to now. The bureaucratic structure in the board of education for example. Or how to say 86 a whiskey down with the schmere. The orientation does teach them how to find the apartment in New York City. No laughing matter. Well, if it's a laughing matter it's in that bitter, rufal kind of way. But very surprised, in one weekend, if hitting the streets during a Wall Street boom, they all have no. homes. Home save given names. This is the most true. Can't take your home home. Please leave the rest of the room to the right team. Thank you. This is the most important thing to have here now. Please leave the rest of the room to the right team. Elka and Andrea live in the graves in the future. Loots in Nicholas are in sunset park another park. Their place is huge in some seven of the teachers occupied two apartments in the same building. They are in the same building. They take me along with them when they go to see their school for first, a few days before they begin to dismiss. It's too subway rides away in Bensonhurst, and they are in Brooklyn. Bensonhurst was the soon-to-send racist laugh that was for years back. I am quite frankly terrified of the fun group. As far as I knew, if you weren't right, Italian American, in Strait, you stayed in Bensonhurst. But as it turns out, FDR's 4,000 kids are from 7 different countries representing 32 different. language groups. One third of them identified as limited in the speaking young listening tape entered the U.S. within the last two or three years. Easily 60% of the entire student body was born out of the United States. The Austrians were being right in homes. The media attention surrounding the chefs and their sons of the baby. Their schools were fielding acreage from CBS, Austrian TV and her Japanese talents. The Austrian stomach have fed up there getting a theme contrary to being too scared to act this subway. I'm familiar with different ethnicities in oblivious to social problems. Looks gently points out that the small matter, which in the side of civil war inform the Yugoslavia, is happening not too far from the end. Their refugees coming into Austria every day. Looks in Nikki are not men or unaware of the outside world. We are international people, Susan, who's girlfriend is spending the year walking in I asked him if they have drugs and teenage pregnancy and looks for a place of course something not a big city or city of this city. But it's really an idiotic question. Where do I think they can change along? Franklin Delano Roosevelt is beside Hube soon. Literally beside the graveyard with headstones coming right up to the It almost seems  a team exploitation from the jet, the summer camp, actually built across the next food and sails. Architecturally, the school is one of those early 60s Bauhausen structures of glass and soon to block. It's quite an attractive building actually and there's a friendly resistance and community. It's in perfect and fair, the flask's clean. We run into the school guidance counselors from treat the Austrian foreign likes and let's... justước��婧 Auacement espes野 I'm sorry I'm too busy. Yeah, I'm just okay. I'm only having a right chance. Despite the fact that she is two days to get to school ready for 4,000 students, and that Andrea looks Nikki and Elcar by no means the only four new teachers starting this year. FDR's principal, the amaze, and Elvon Cell, takes the time to sit down from the conference room. See you next time. I wasn't talking to you  horse, just teachers. And it's not for my benefit, I am everyone, tell me. As I said before, it shows you feeling that's probably the greatest feeling that don't be afraid of them. What is ahead of you of city kids? They've got kids, okay? Well, it's not the essence, it's not the warmth, it's not the chemical. And he wouldn't be it! So, right everybody, let the kids know that's good. Right? Or call? I follow along his leads in Andrea, showing the newly renovated science labs, introduced to the ninth grade biology curriculum, and meet Jim and Alex, two biology teachers, who sit down from the job around  a volunteer viewer for about three months. They're friendly and contagious and funny and irreverved. And  everyone in this school, they project this sense of shared purpose and excitement. You make it look  right now. And there's no fallibility. There's no that some wash-burns have felt their promises. All of this is going along with what's dispelling the fear of the school things in two days. I can check to there are a lot of the same goodwill. and helpers, so evidently, if DRC is emanating large part from the Delvin cell. She speaks to the OS, and indeed everyone were introduced from the vice-principals to the payrolls and others, as powerful as not as smart. It strikes me that the New York Disorder Games will be working in a very different from the New York and hindered by the members of the media covering, including myself. The starters, there's a lack of iron post, and two of us everyone are in count. I'm going to start. No one is making constant airports and dropping their voices in what new series is affection. No one acts  they've seen it all. At one point during a teacher orientation, Adele herself read a poem called Aventy, through whom from the books. I don't call teachers trouble, my grades have been okay. I've listened in my classes and in school and in my... My teacher Sam Aventy, my parents think so too. I wish I didn't know. that, because there's a lot of activity. I'd  to build a rock, I have a book to tell you how, and start a stamp collection, I'll know you's throwing now. Because since I found out I'm average, I'm just smart enough to see, it means I'm nothing special and I should expect to be. Later on, at a reception at the Austrian consulate, another woman in public education planted herself in the middle of the world. Took out a laminate. cards from the pocket and read a poem to the effect of a hundred years from now it will not matter how much money I made, what kind of car I drove, how big my house was, why they're or not I was famous, what will matter? Is that I made a difference in the life of a child? Generally the words, I'm just going to redo this poem, illicit feelings of mild embarrassment to make up, how have however on this I'm not proud to admit that I was a little immune to some of my first 3rd-year-old response. Neither of them is very good poetry after all. But on reflection I realized that they achieved precisely what poetry is meant to accomplish. They edify, they elevate, they speak to an underlying truth not immediately apparent, they change the way one looks at things. We in the media have all been portraying the Austrians as heading off into a black born jungle, all cynicism institutional neglect and violence. When in fact, their comparative are of the national state who leads the continent to a мод化 of the late Thursday of the year end of Service, a world none of us reporters in the world where being earnest and avid compassionate is anything buttoned on us. It's been made clear to me by a Delva cell that I'm not welcoming to the plants from this monster's students arrived. Probelegation should count on these little kids and by the being on this search stretch. I see the senseless but I need to see what happens with the ones during the four. Sorry if I can see dead. they exactly seem happy to be honest. We have two dinners, one in September and one March. At both they described the work as hard and time teaching, with the links for the comparing lessons spreading homework, or marking the many many tests as into a mince, far more than a given school of some often. And seeing New York City teaching methods up post in 1st hand, the Austrian 4-Finding some of their own pre-consulting street art. They seem surprised in more than a little bit this morning. the danger training turns out to be far more unconventional modern than that they are American children apart. It turns out that they were being worn against talking talk if they are orientation because talking talk remains such as the nation's means to American teacher. , we're trying not just children tough and we're very eager to learn the American brave teaching to see alternative concepts approach that you're asking all the stuff and of I think a lot of us have forged other teachers teaching and this is a contraled lessons and all that we see is Chalkintok, Chalkintok, you don't see any ads. And we are a children, you do group work or something in school, sometimes, now in the other day. I really dare to say that the Austrian teachers to move the pupils and the Latin teachers. I think the emergency system is just a couple. Yeah, just blah blah blah blah. I'm just sitting there. Yeah, what do you think I'm doing maybe? You can listen. And you see the window. System is contrary to our beliefs. I think that everybody is very disenfranchised. This system here, very disenfranchised. make all that. So that was what we wanted to do. At the dinner in March, they feel calm and more positive and three-dimensioned view of American methods in school and general, as they themselves have been launched. After sharing three-bottles of wine and giving them enough courage for my next question, the question that I've been waiting to ask since the day they can meet the misfigured and should we start using it as a whole? So how are you guys ever seen some of the music? No are they? Yeah. I was in the American. Yeah, , yes. Yes. No boss, , this is something. No, this is what is the first one. You should show this in David's life. Hey, that's your, so you do know something. Yes, no. I can tell the body. Yes, and whatever. But it was, but it was national anthem of all stress. Nobody knows anything. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. And we just thought we'd just assume the variable traffic was in the fog here. , we're doing everything? Yes, no problems. And fixed in the dark. We're going to do something. Ever the gracious hurts, and ever either for a colorful setting and spun, and the surface is very scary. I take the oscillate to see the new lockdown around, and it's easier to understand that. It's an enormous diagram of the fun birds with scale models, with easy food, right on the computer. I checked everything's there, right down from a half into the computer for a story browns from where I... The diorama is really big, certainly a healthy percentage of the foot off of the size. Spectators walk around its perimeter on Captain Food Buff. The video-type presentation about the display is construction that plays constantly on the loop, begins with an announcer explaining over a Gershonen score, New York City, the big apple making it big the arts capital of the world. This bit of cheap New York New York propaganda is metaphorically new and naive. Because what we're actually sees when looking at this accurate depiction of the city of its entirety is that most of the city, the New York that is New York to most New Yorkers is actually Queen. It's broken, staten out the bronze, which all contained some pretty vast areas of urban delight in desolation. It is the perfect backdrop to ask in how they're doing. They are some very rapid. But the relation to the kids is better and to some classes that are really interesting in the world, how to handle the kids and the ones that need to be able to move. possible now to make it more interesting for both songs. So let do they see the first lost childhood? Yes, I mean I don't think that you've been lost real relationship with that and say, and form them. And form this and form this because they are making jokes and I'm laughing and I'm not making jokes and being awful. It's very seldom you find that's not bad things. Do you feel  teacher is it? see  foreign teachers. Now I feel what the teacher does. That doesn't suit me. We're standing over the Brackon Beach in Rockaway, as part of the diorama. We're in the happenfabra Hmentes. And while it's certainly the most crowded at the end, it's built as you can tell us. It's also noticed that the small ones, seeing it from here, and they equivalent to a few thousand feet up, Manhattan's disproportionate. with the power of its fuel over the millions in the outer boroughs. It seems not just strange. It seems fuel. All of us in the media have been wondering how the Austro-Hins would deal with all. Spectrum into crumpled one actually faced with real New York. It's the smuggish runs that men happen nights  myself know what we mean on kids. But more than almost anyone I know, these four teachers have been frosted into a uniquely diverse mix. in life, for most everyone's from some girls. In my search for an authentic backdrop to the scene, I've brought these teachers to a large similar, when probably the most authentically new of the place is the block I need. It's time for enter houses. There's a life, a red knot light. Okay, minutes, it's okay, right. Well, here, okay, now. So that's what we're going to look . So this sense is arc, which that's more greener than the bigger. The name is the penis shelter. Small one is the sun's spot. The sun's spot is the fifth year to the center.

It is all one can do not to stretch out on its arms and turn around some seen none on the mountain side for the sheer joy and beauty of the future. Tiny planes on visible wires come in from landings and take off from the diorama aircraft. And far higher than all of them, than airplanes sales through the sky, tracing its path from across the Atlantic westland to somewhere else on the continent. Mickey wonders aloud how any plane passing over New York and past. this land? Indeed how could end your craft of northerners people? It becomes reeling of a craftsman.

Life is a little bit in the here, very good thing, and  from me, very very good. Ignatius is here for school, works in parking garage.

The risks were° Some people take a long time to convince, to feel  they belong here. Alex came up with a small town Sicily, back in 1959. I mean, we would do the pleasure of the agency industry. And a lot of kids I noticed were assimilated,  my brother from his agency simulated really fast. And that's the thing about the 40 years. And that it is taken me to really calm myself and learn. What's amazing about his story is just how American anybody would think he was his book English worked among non-Sesalians married non-Sesalian live  this for decades And still he did not believe that he belonged to him So there was always the hope of going back and there was always the feeling that And I'm Do you think there's anything that could have changed that would make you feel on there? And then you had a job you weren't blind with you married somebody you children born American citizens. Yeah, by this time for instance my father, my mother became citizens, I refuse to be considered. How come? Because I didn't feel this was my country. And was there something about America that felt too different from the way you thought about yourself? Yeah, there was a lot of things I couldn't understand. at that point, what would those things happen? No, I... didn't feel connected to the ground I walked on. I didn't feel  I was sitting in the chair and was sitting. When I was eating, I felt that I wasn't eating food. The first time I was eating food, I was eating food. The first time I was eating food, I was eating food. What changed this feeling about America? When this mother was buried here in American soil, I only found a church in the community here. When he spent time alone in the wilderness in southern Utah, he became a citizen in 1998 after 40 years. Some people never make the transition. And that is a subject of our next act in our program today. Back to our movies, stronger than commoners. This is the story of a father and son, co-betheson, once out devour, who is born in Cuba. We never thought about leaving Cuba, at least that. As a 13-year-old, I knew my father was a new kid. I knew my uncle. that left in the 60s and I was I grew up in the system and I never thought that I was in the evening my picture of the United States was  this is the place for monopolis and prostitution drugs and can pardon the street at night because you didn't want everything again I'm in this respect yeah I was  basically everything that I was told The marials boat lived happen in 19th century. There were a few people into the brewing industry. And as far as having this, there was a big end. Civil unrest I was created by the fact that within a week there were about 500 people crammed in the brewing industry asking for a bullet or something. And in Fidel had a speech on national television and claimed that anybody if they wanted to leave could because anybody who wanted to leave. wasn't really wanted for the revolution, the Paris Senator of the revolution. So he created demonstrations nationwide. I was actually out at this administration streaming, people areewaring. And then within a week my whole world turned around because one of my uncles who was in Miami came on a boat to pick us up, me and the family and the team back to the Treaty of Kibbons who had left Kibbons, 60s who let them out. decided to go on the get their families because it was possible for them to leave the comfort. It was some chaos that's in me. And so it's up to about five years ago we decided to make a movie about your family. But that any fun day in me, just shooting on your round to see what I'm hoping. Yeah, I started by basically just asking the whole family to tell me. how they remember the whole experience. My other objective when I first started shooting was to try to find out, , what had gone on in mind of my dad and whether he felt okay with the decision that we had made about Kamino. Because I felt that once we got here, even though our family was brought together in the sense, he also regretted from us and I felt that he was in. He had seen more of the press than rejected and he had a job that wasn't so great. He was always afraid to lose it. He works a lot of hours. He doesn't pay very well. And so he wasn't  that when I was growing up, he was more, , he was building a house in Cuba. He had friends and supported it. They found ways to get food and clothing. He was much more going than he was. So I wanted to find out,  what had happened. And so I decided this summer to go back to Cuba. And I said, well, questions, one of them was, , did we make the right decision? I wanted to see what my family that was left behind was , what their life was . And I was hoping that I don't get it going back. I would find something that would make him feel better about the decision that we made. Yeah. So I took the trip I went back and offered him ice cream. And that was the last summer was the first time I had been back in 18 years. Wow. And it was a very intense trip. I did today life, this is very, very hard. And it became very clear to me that , he had to make the right decision. their lives and the opportunities that we have had here. We would have never had. Why, what did you see? What kind of situation we have been in this in? I saw, I talked to a lot of young people when I was there. And I saw that a lot of them had a lot of ambitions that they felt were never going to happen. They wanted to study things that they were going to allow to study because they were in this ration. So there's only a certain number of... positions for lawyers every year and per town. A lot of them felt also  there was even if they could study what they want, they weren't. They could never really get the things that young people have and say America, North Park School. And then what about your family members? They speak directly to your dad, , through the video can? Yeah, I had my, I had, I collected a series of video letters when I was in Cuba. And I went, I took some from family, and then I also went and set out friends of my father, but I knew we were very close to him before he left. And they wanted to see him again. They said not to be afraid to go back. That nothing was going to happen, people go back home to them. And they said to him that if, if, If he came to Cuba, if he were to come to Cuba without us, heard him be back. He would leave fully closed and fully fed, and that they would make sure that that would happen. And it was very emotional when he was very emotional when he showed the food. And what did they tell him about whether or not he should have left? Did they tell him that he's in a state? No, they told him that he shouldn't feel that for the fact that they understand that they was probably the hardest decision he's ever made. They said that it looked your family and his mouth, he should not feel bad about it. Here's your son, , come back to find his roots and make a connection with people here behind you. They reassured them all the things that I have been saying to him. And when you said him before, what was his name? He said, really? Now, he still said that that's something that he's always in the field, he's older. So what I can say. Do you think he regrets coming? I'm bringing you all. I think because he was cheering things for himself. Grab before you left. And he hasn't really been able to do that as much as he's been in the States. Harder than harder than he has to feel. That... There he's life is moving in a better direction. I guess I'm not... , I don't know. He hasn't said that he regrets having come to the United States. But he is, , disappointed in in half things have gone since it's been here. I think so. Yeah, I think he is expecting things to go better. I think he is expecting to achieve the narrative meaning. And he just doesn't  the way this culture works. He doesn't  that people have to have two jobs and doesn't  the fact that they don't get to see your relatives in your day. And put Don Lid close enough that you can go walk to somebody's house in Barrow couple of times. So he feels very alienated. And feels he has. to drive everywhere, , anybody works different hours and can't miss. His brothers was often used to he was , , you see, he's his, he's his nephews. It's interesting, he's disappointed in America, but it's in such a different way than, , than the communist government of Cuba told him what America would be. if if Fidel had been saying, , if you come to America, you're going to be working to jobs. Your family won't live now in the plah I'm gonna head more of a fact. He's over. Perhaps Look you're my dentist He does in your front must be decades. Do you think at this point he feels American? he just became a citizen and I talked about it happened I wasn't a York and I wasn't able to go down I wanted to be there when he was going for this swearing and what made him decide to do it right now? Why now? I Think the main thing was this law that passed that said that if you weren't on American citizen You would retire. You would lose all your benefits. Oh Yeah, yeah, I don't think he would have done it otherwise I don't think really has any interest. He's supposed to cube in that and speed him. Yeah. Is he thinking about going back now? No, I asked him if he wanted to go back. And now I asked him , beginning when I started shooting for years ago, if he wanted to go back to Cuba. And he said no. And I asked him in August, I tried to get back from Cuba, whether or not he's still fell the same way. And he said, Yeah, he still wouldn't go back. , there's nothing for him there, no. You must be in the spice that we saw this, the video of the original. You must be in the spice that we've seen in the movie. I really was. And now it was a little disappointed. I, however, haven't shown me. And I don't know, this is the dream of any artist who I can just say. Yeah. Well, because we've had all this very disembodied conversations, , which I think is how he's isn't. To me, I'm thinking about this and working in this whole process for me. So I have all this ideas that I've been working on. And I'm able to talk to you about this and get something to think about. four years. I think with him it's more  separate conversations that he's had with him. And he hasn't really been able to sit down and evaluate the whole experience. As you talk to you, he's noticed the level of energy that you're putting into healing this thing for him. Because it is you're touched by what it is you understand. I don't think he understands fully. You don't think he sees it and my family's time is I say, I don't think he sees it or something that I'm doing for him. I think actually that before the trip all this time he thought that I was doing it because somehow I questioned whether my decision comes. What's right? And I think he's probably thought that's it. He's my own career in the same thing. I don't know that he's only me. knows that this is not good. It's about me trying to make me feel better. It's just striking. I felt that it's  what we're doing is it using the tools of rationality to achieve something that maybe can't achieve because it's just a fool. Do  what I mean with his part? I  that feeling that he has isn't going to change through argumentation. And now I feel  you've now you've listed this. a full power of motion picture narrative. Do  what I mean? I imagine  because you got down and you have this whole story going you shot these people and these images. And  at some point there'll be  music underneath the whole thing. You have all of these things. And the notion of will it change this man's point of view about himself. it's just I want to with it is it can. It's of all the power cannot. You think about  what is the power of movement? And does it include? how it achieves a person's feeling that he's similar. , , sometimes it's, if somebody were to paint a picture of you, you may remember nothing that it looks  you. But I think that if you stay out of four hours, you start seeing the way somebody else sees you. And there's no way that you cannot learn something from that, whether you think that it looks  you or not. He may not, we him and I never see I tie and he may never see my life. He may never feel better about being here. But there's gotta be something he must be able to learn something from just seeing my perception And I think he will give him more insight into how I perceive it. as a human being, , and get to know each other as two men in that and so on. So even if there's a good note, there's a button certainly, there's a new view. Yeah. Yeah. Once out of our smoothie about the spot on the pubics, but now you're in miles, and you must as a distance between the two countries, you mustn't be there.
