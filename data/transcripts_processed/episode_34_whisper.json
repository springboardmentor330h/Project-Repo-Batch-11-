Consider, please, the case of Joe Cubsuela, middle class guy, just for a Democratic, listen, San Diego, the state that the Democrats have to take in the White House. And let's begin with this fact about. Although his parents immigrated from Mexico, and eventually, he's citizens. This has to be his entire family. Isn't paper. proposition 187, but rather with 9, public services to illegal aliens. They're public schooling, they're services. To me, I don't think that you get a free education. If they want an education, they want to come over here. They don't pay for it. I mean, me as a Mexican, American, I cannot go over there and get it. , their government is not supplying the needs of the people over there. That's why they're coming over here because this government's given it away free. charge for it. That's the way I see it. He says he put a democratic musters lie and then when George Bush ran president, he just started sinking stiff and although he himself had been on and off well for a couple of times and although his daughter has been on well for five years or so, what the Republicans were saying especially that well. how to sense it? I could be on this bill if I wanted because it's not so bad. So by me, exactly how to say it. that researchers, but I refuse to sit at home and watch TV, , and collect a month from the chat, let's not be. So I believe that's what made this a good great, it's the fact that we can work, . The Republicans seem to share these middle class values. When I asked him if he liked any of the things that the Democrats did for him, he caused a long, long time. And then finally he said, well, what do they stand for? Women in military, , a rights, , it wasn't that he disagreed. It said they seem to stand for nothing, which brings us to the topic of getting out. This week's democratic national convention. They all did set been instructed. When they talked, the press they would talk about the three big themes. Three big themes I should say. Designed precisely. When you may ever differentiate jokes out of your class. We have been told that we should be emphasizing the themes of opportunity, responsibility, and community. But these are the themes, these themes are so vague. It's a vague, anything to be a community opportunity and responsibility. And that could be those to be the Republican. The Earth is true. If I this woman, Rukar, what's told me that her delegation was from Vermont. I've been playing this little game with the theme, the way that it worked is that you try to make a sentence using all the three words. And then you try to work that sentence. into everyday conversation. So for example, if you're getting into a cab, you say something , I feel it's my responsibility as a member of this community to give you the opportunity to get in first. In a certain way, this was not that different from what people were trying to do in seriousness. Several people went through the motions for me of trying to express their beliefs in terms of the three big themes, but it always had the air of somebody growing a 9th grade essay. topic. He never had the directness and conviction that the Republican delegates in San Diego had when they talked to me about the very complete goals . Fifty percent tax cut, banning abortion, getting school vouchers, stuff  that. And it's hard to imagine Joe Copper's sweater would have been satisfied with what he heard on his Democrats. Why don't you find the fancy way to say this? But from WB Easy Chicago is the scenario from live on my request. Each week we bring you stories from a variety of writers and performers on some topic. In this hour, today, stories from the Democratic Convention you probably have not heard elsewhere and how did the Democrats communicate with this anymore? At one, we'll tour inside the message machine. Back to the latest installment of my Lewis' campaign diaries this week. Michael makes Algor nervous. Act 3. This act, you may remember a best-selling book for a few years ago called There are no children here. By writing an Alex Katowice, there was an Oprah Winfrey movie of this. There's about two boys growing up in Chicago's Henry Horner, almost hasn't projects. Well, those projects are the projects that are directly across the street from the Democratic Convention. I'm one of the kids from that book, whose now grown up, gives us a tour. This makes some super-ish-up cleaning up for me. invention, probably search. But there's a way more profound and interesting change going more in the internet as well. X4, Webmaster, and Beverly Hills 90210 expert Danny Drennan on the convention, and more stay with us. N-6, read B-1. at gunarım. Today's before the Republican Convention started, security was already great. Today's before the Democratic Convention was still possible, just to breeze into the hall, walk into all the hidden corridors, the straight to the make-up rooms, the traders room, the sign rooms, which are basically these big freezers, filled with pre-printed signs from the pre-planned, war demonstrations. This itself had the Brady Dill in many new jobs from the Indian Commission. Let's edit an item. to Barbara Boxer came to Mercy empty, hall, with a few eggs just to check it out. The world of TV screensets on the podium had no images on the push-to-step donning, dais, and then, as it activated by the mere presence of the United States senator, they filled with heartwarming, black and white images of everyday Americans. Most of the people in the hoddle witnessed this with balloon rank-horse. One of the pubs. of trying to report on these conventions over television radio is that it's hard to convey the sheer size of what they're about. The hundreds of lavish parties each day, the millions of dollars of TV studios and offices, bought and brought in just for this occasion and a Olympic village, these and travelers outside the hall, which I'll get torn down in four days. So to get a sense to the scale of this, let's just take one small aspect of it and let's take the blue 개인land. thousand balloons in bags a thousand balloons each they get placed so we have to the ceiling of the United Center. This is the second biggest balloons drop ever according to Tansy Lewis who is one of the minority countries got the country to be strong. What's the next biggest job you've done to this job? To be honest my largest job that tastes of Chicago this summer. So how many balloons was in that? That consisted of only a thousand. the most. So that's just the number of wounds in one of these bags. It's correct. It took 150 people four days and nights to build the grunts. They did it Malcolm X College, which is just two blocks from the bench and sight. One can only imagine what Malcolm X said about all this. Upstairs in the school by any means necessary as Peter and Waw. Downstairs One should 50 people were feeling the wounds celebrate their kind running their city. huge nets, each body feet long. If you picture a bag that you could drive three pickup trucks, pretty much got the idea of what one is in the sort of bags. And 11 of them filled with red white and blue balloons, lay on the corner of which amazing. The air was thick, the plastic, how do you smell the balloons? There's such a big argument. Take Swiss turn in the net. Take Swiss not in the net. So you have, what is that? a critic tape around your fingers? Right. Keep this on early. Because after a while you finish stocked up, you get  a blister. Surprisingly, even here in Democratic Chicago, in room full of people carrying a big party for build planning. People who don't even know if they're going to get paid for their works, feelings about President Trump. Now you have a big question and couldn't support her? No. I mean, I was recording because these are friends of them, but I'm ... I don't really, yeah, I come. Because I am the boy against this sin and I don't know people that are forced to marry, don't believe in certain things that President Curtain is poor. America is turning away from God and so therefore the God is turning from America and I really do that's why you have this high crime range. Across the room, 11 year old Jaris King and two other people who are wasted, 40 foot long bag of balloons over their heads, carry it out to the hallway. And Jaris, quick. to know when it's important. I feel  I'm a blacksmith. It does kind of work  Jeff and Swords. The balloons are carried down the hall of the stairway around the series tights for his throwaways. I don't know what I'm going to go out in the night. I've got two blocks on the day and to the convention building, where they're checked by the secret service. And then we'll get up to the show. It's three days of work, but  a few seconds, the special effects and it doesn't really make sense, but we gotta do it anyway. Of course, there has to be a good thought. It's the key. at the end of the wedding. It's , it's the money shop. Delacratzo! Delacatzo! Delacatzo! It's an alternate strategy! It's an alternate strategy! It's an alternate strategy! It's an alternate strategy! Monday morning, hotel bar. We've got several speakers today describing what the winning strategy is for the Democrats. And the armists that we go out for doing battle. I'm Heather Booth, the trading director of the... Democratic National Committee. Every day the DNC held these morning seminars. They combined practical information about King Law, but it is talking points and issues, speakers, and campaign strategist James Carvelle, who he is, he's the mix of truths, half truths, and I have to say real walkers to inspire the party faithful. And I love when the Republicans did buy those and well, the teachers are all over the Democrats, okay? Get it. Put a demo crash? You back and come to the room up. No, I'll die a question, boy. When you get drugs, I'm all in the round of no. They are dangerous, smoke cigarettes. In fact, the tobacco company is sponsored both political parties, and that support included sponsorship of a number of events at this very convention. After Carville, Congressman Stany Hoyer presented a series of charts and graphs on overhead slides. To make the case for how the demo pets can take 20 new seats in the house of RIPS. to get in the house majority and not new Kingbridge out of the speakers share. Now this is the important point because I want all of you to believe deeply, in-grade, intellectually, on a motion when you go back to your states, for your was right, we did one fact on how to approach this. Republicans currently own 28 states that traditionally before Democratic, these are Democratic seats we ought to have. Republicans own 77 seats. But 31, 33 of these Republicans see its long depression and became in the less than 55% of vote. It was one chart after another, each with a timing of word yellow arrow. When it came to the part of the presentation, more concerted, or your head name, actual races that were in the bag, get a million five percent. If you ask nonpartisan experts, politics  Charles Cook, who publishes one of another landmark inailing the race, cuts on the top of the Pi怎ver. Small world? D學man bucks away from the box. Soldier謝謝 George Amendment, Masha motherfucker. chances to be in the house this way. I think Democrats have about a 30 or 40% chance of getting the house back, but that's down from about 50% or 40% or 50% maybe a month or so. One of the questions were watching very carefully is something called the generic congressional ballot test. When you ask the if the election call that we broke the Democratic Center for Congress of Public Canada and we received Democrats in the 670 to 8.0 on a lot of polls late June early July at that level it was roughly a... the title wave of the back to the U.S. all Republicans went in 1994. Today it's down at the two or three point range, which is right about it the edge of what they need to get that house back. Interestingly, Mr. Cook was one of the experts congressmen who are cited, but when congressmen who are quoted, those support the case at Democratic Suite. In the convention hall, the rule of thumb said that he worked coverful buttons somewhere. the more important they are. Probably also didn't see this at home, but for everybody know this periodically throughout the convention, everyone on the floor would stop the business of politics and just do the macarena? Over and over, the macarena is the official song of the Democratic National Convention. A political convention  this essentially has to sell at the actual problem. How to take an ordinary person and make him seem larger than . And the problem is completely... down to the age of television because people will be possibly know more intimately than we know Bill Clinton. He's in our homes every day on television. We've heard about his sex life, we've heard about his finances, we've heard about his bad investments, we know his ideas, we know what he eats, we know what the man wears jogging. I mean do  what your friends were jogging? Justin Hayford attended the convention for American theater. And he said to make him seem larger than life in this setting, they use one. the oldest tricks in the book, and that is the long, slow arrival. , with the person's constantly being announced, we're possibly hearing word of the great man's imminent arrival. Of course, it was the train trip. The train trip. That's gorgeous. Because the most postmodern element about this convention is the performance of absence that they are working extremely hard to make his absence a sort of ache, a longing for this man. And so from the very first day, there are train. updates. I don't know if he ended up on television when I put there are train updates where they cut away on the large video screen. So those schematic map of this 1800 mile train we're going through the heart on the course and they were saying, here's a live shot of his his train pulling into Lindlio higher somewhere and you see  a train going by. People cheer and they'll have to see the train before. So we get in closer and closer and closer and then the gospel choir comes out and they're saying if you want him if you need him if you adore him shot yet. and I never mention who him is. We almost assumed it's the present. So we're following his progress. I thought he was going to sail across the lake. Which I thought was a beautiful, clear, a pattern-esque move coming in on the great golden bars. But he didn't give him a helicopter, which is quite an entrance. And then, Daily said, Mr. President, we've been going for days to see you. Which I thought was the ultimate capric to that entrance, which is, , we're dying. for your presence, you're dying to eat you with our eyes. That's what we haven't for the last four years. Well, every intimate detail on this life we've seen. So in the hall, did this create an aching desire to see the president? Just an hatred says it on the first day, first train update. People screamed , , it was David Bowie's. And yesterday I was there on the afternoon. and then the same thing, the next, when it was trained up, and nobody paid any attention. Of course he says when Bill Clinton finally did appear, in person. By that point, he had appeared so many times in the hall on video. That there wasn't a kind of thrill to see him in person. You saw you used him on television, and in the age of television, that is the rarest thing of all. See the man. and the theater of it is really hard to be. You are so nice to me. You are all my sight. You are the man with the mindest touch. You are all my sight with the mindest touch. You are the man who has the plans. You have the ability to look people to work. You are the person of the United States. I'm just going to stop the side right there. That is my favorite line in the song and maybe in almost any song. Okay, here's your writing assignment. You want to write a song about the person this by the way is Wesley. Well, that's a local Chicago artist. So what are you going to say? Well, , you can kind of run out of things of inspiration. So then you can just go into the story. straight actual mode you are the president of the United States. You automatically ask the clients you have to tell them you can book people to work. You are the president of the United States. I'm  in a life in our world. You. You. You. You. You. Act 2. No show. 15,000 members of the press were here in Chicago for the convention and while you probably have guessed that political conventions are a big reunion for party regulators to make your priorities. Unless you think that you might not realize that for many reporters it's also a big reunion. I saw people at the convention that I have not seen in years and that was true in San Diego as well. So what did people talk about? Did these very high powered media events? Well? as far as I can tell, it's a little politics, a lot of gossip. And then the other night, I was with some friends visiting from New York City to come to the convention. And my friends from New York got into this conversation that was so strange to me that at some point I put out my kid's order and just started paving. The conversation was about the New York Times. And it began with one of the New Yorkers said with pleasure, with the kind of intense pleasure actually. But the Times arrives itself. seven in the morning, she sort of announced this. At home, she gets the time to five, 30, which is better of course, but seven was still just very, very good. I'm up, , to stand at that, that they were all used to make five or running. Then, all the New York media started, , pleasing each other about the New York Times at me. In my new detail, chess columnists who've gone on to other beats, at people who... moved to Atlanta and Fummit Atlanta. People who I had never even heard of. Who does his main beat is basically  feelings and psychology? Yeah, why? I know that would be harder. Who's the doctor columnist? Meadow? , what's the same often? Sometimes you use his MD and that sometimes doesn't. My more or less, atheists' friends from the liberal elite media. At the same relationship to the New York Times that certain Catholics have with a Vatican. The Times. speaks diminately. They kneel before it. They clippled with it. It's near. I have to say this was the most animated conversation. They had all night and it lasted. It lasted  half an hour. I mean at some point I just had to say, good night, they could have kept going. Okay, now Steven I know that's the biggest focus of the rest of you. Who is most likely if it's discovered that there is or is not. God. Who is most likely to have this door? There's one reporter who's all who's  the existential reporter for the touch. There you have it. By from the past line, over price drinks came from her top bar, went quickly onto some TV networks, charged card. Well, one reporter who was here with the 15,000 is Michael Lewis. Who's been publishing this campaign diary, isn't it? the public, and reading them from time to time for not very proven, he's new to the soul unpacked during the last thing. Antipolitical conventions, and here's the latest in style, from his campaign diary. August the 19th, one moment I'm sleeping soundly in my hotel room in San Diego, the next the phone is ringing and a voice on the other end of the line is asking, this is the vice president's office, can you take the call? Al Gore himself is on the line. In a moment of weakness, thinking that maybe I should interview someone important. I had sent a message that for his office saying that I wanted to speak with. I hardly expected him to take it serious. It's nerve wracking getting a call from the vice president, say, pretending to be my way. Gork chuckles unhappy. I've made him uncomfortable. No, seriously. I say this is the highest I've caused him. This merely makes things worse. I don't believe that at all. He says, seriously. This has been an idiot. you back in some acceptable court of political discourse. I have only five minutes to interview who have been renowned God. I'm sort of curious to know if Gores and Biomell are as it appears as managed down the sinkhole of practical politics. For the vice-presence conversation is littered with frankly and to be honest with you and it is my understanding all of which transpres in the civilian English as I'm never going to tell you the truth that anything's a liar. the US. Before he hangs up, Gore tells me that, A, Americans truly are committed to the church. B, that he's not more intimidated having to debate Jack and having to debate say, connet. And C, that the collection of speeches written by White House speech writers, and now published as a book by Bill Clinton, was penned entirely by Clinton himself. It is his understanding. August 26th and 27th. Your first day at a convention is  your first day at school. Upon seeing the boards, your first instinct is that something important is that everyone must know something you doubt. For a few hours I am engaged in a wild undignified scramble, find out what that something is. During this uncomfortable period, all sorts of information lands on my lap. A stack of old articles from Chicago, magas. Graff. speeches by retired Congress, lists of delegates, stuff no one in his right mind would read. But nothing can be ignored, I even interviewed you with doubt. But then there is this tremendous noise on one side of the convention hall. A spontaneous outbreak of whistles, cheers that draws all the attention to the entrance beneath the Nevada delegation. The sound is exactly what you would expect if a billion is handing out sacks of cash, where if a woman would perform his scripted. Here I think is clearly where the ashes. I plough through the crap, find out what it is. It is Al Gore. A normal person might well wonder what 15,000 journalists are doing covering an event of dubious importance. It's not an easy question, answer. The journalists who write about other journalists  Halley Kurtz, The Washington write about the futility of being a journalist. to the Democratic Convention. The post-time poll descent, the same number of people here as they had in all their foreign bureaus combined. The famous germs invert their occupation and give interviews other germs. The rest of us are resigned upon some negative slightly different from the negative sub-udus. It turns out, few of the journalists actually attend the convention, except during the time time. The journalists remain in their tents outside the United Center. In the first two days, clean three-per-team the afternoon and seven at night. Maybe a few dozen people passed through the section of the hall reserved for the periodical crafts. This is a shame because the best time to be in the hall was in no one is paying much attention. For example, Hillary Clinton hobs in mid-afternoon to check the micro-steps and hide a reporter. She steps up in her pink suit. And when she sees her party. in his two-five, picks off her pink heels. She stands there girlish, and you're stalking feet, asking too many questions and men around, and you can see that  everyone else in plays her adamant and roll. She's far more vulnerable than she lets on. Later, out here, from one of her speedrunners, that she's as nervous as she looks. It's her first speech in prime time. Even after the convention begins, no one pays it much heat. So when pik. F-art speaks. I'm able to call right up behind him on the platform and see what life looks  from the speakers one to the It essentially life looks predetermined. The speaker stares in the four telecomps. One in his left shoulder, another it is right shoulder. A third mounted straight ahead of across the hall just to meet the cameras so that he can appear to be looking. And you're watching him on TV. The fourth is embedded into the podium just above his name. Get part speech in letters for inches high  the text of a book for the algorithm. Scrolls gently across. Get part has only the swivel back and forth between the teleproper and pretend not to be reading word for word. Which he is. We meet here to offer a vision, not just a show for television. He is saying. Bio1. The under no one listens. Part of the thrill of watching a public speaker lies in the risk of the speaker takes and putting himself for it. Jesse Jackson, for one, understands this. In the first two days, he alone shuts down the telecom and speaks from loose notes, and he alone pulling gauges the crowd. Interestingly, the moment he first brings the crowd to his feet is just the moment that he leaves his notes. But Jackson is the exception. The average convention. speech, the rise is not out of the need of the speaker to say something important, but out of the speaker's desire to have delivered a speech at the convention . It's purpose from the speaker's point here is to establish his position in the official structure of the Democratic Party. The big exception of the speech is designed to make people cry. Ron Brown's widow, Jim Brady's wife and Christopher Reed. Our course well-known victims, the speeches delivered by relative unknowns in the wee hours of the afternoon, contained wagonloads more of the same backups. Here is a representative sample of opening lines, the snatched in a single pass of the press vehicle. As the father of the child, brutally murdered by a habitual violent criminal. As many of , my husband was a former tobacco lobbyist who got this past December 7, 1993. That was the day a man with a semi-automatic weapon board of the train. My husband wanted those killed. By early in the second day you can see that people's capacity to absorb bad news is Dwindle, and nothing. A pleasant middle-aged woman describes the recent death of her husband from lung cancer for instance, and no one in the hall pays her any mind. It is an incongruous site. A woman in bright yellow on the verge of tears. as she relates her tragic loss, over a loud comment from the audience below, most of which is in gross and small talk and hot thoughts. Raising my binoculars, necessary equipment, from the floor to the ceiling, I can't help it notice some. How are you, again, the wider the people, yeah? Almost all of them. Blackies will run the floor. The faces in the sky boxes are really white. A nuggin! And the end of the first evening I make my way up in the sky box. The sky boxes that they're conventionators that are much  the sky box and that the bowl of games. They've been reserved for the rich people in their companies who can afford to pay for. These include some of the 70th and corporate CEO. Many of them were public. We caught up $100,000 each. The honorary vice chair of the Democratic Convention. Here is where you see curtain off rooms. Decorated with signs that say, The Democratic Party would  to thank, especially as Chicago Board Options Exchange . And Patent Vogue's LLD. Here is where you can find the people on whom the politicians focus their private attention. These people sit sipping red wine and nibbling on goodies. Looky! down upon the politicians each tomorrow, but have no choice to take their phone calls. If the end of the first night, we're pretty much everyone is left. But inside one of the many sweets, coils and middle-aged women in the black and white tangency, for maybe half an hour the woman works alone, tossing out open but unpushed bottles of wine, and dumping large silver trays of food in the giant green crash bags. The food humbles into the bag and mouthwatering heaps. Chicken and beef sack deck. Fried, pateau, pump bombs. Shrimp, remmon, thinly sliced meats rolled up  oriental carpets. I'm curious what the woman is being paid to chuck out thousands of dollars in one touch food. But ask instead more generally about salaries at the United States. You mean what do I make? It's cheap money as she empties a cow's worth of beef sack deck into the garbage. Horbucks an hour. This was one of the rooms reserved for the White House staff that were obsessed with. They never came. They never called a cancerer. That's when you were robbed in the Democratic Party. When you don't even care to use your reserve suite. When I watched your stuff in office in Chicago, California, a year and a day, reading newspaper , the convention unfolded on the TV above his head. I didn't appreciate to help him. The most thing to be at the Democratic Convention is a no show. Michael Lewis's campaign diaries, appearing in the New Public, coming up with Michael Lewis, let's assume a private conversation he has with President Clinton, read some of the dance copies of the very current speeches. Actually he just needs a hard to respect. He talks just about Dick Mars. Anyway, it's coming up in a minute. When I program continues. It's a American life, my request. Each week on our program of course we choose topic and bring you documentary stories, radio, monologues, reportage, sound tapes, anything we can think of, such as days that democratic convention that's been happening right here and around that garden Chicago. So Michael Lewis wrote this diary and she said just heard. And ... And then on the last day of the convention, when he came to our studio to record them, the news had broken. That campaign strategist Dick Morris pushed the president to a brace and with values. They let a prostitute listen in with phone conversations yet because, look at the first latest convention speech. Michael had not written about this yet, but he had lots of that. Your first emotional reaction to the news about Dick Morris was, Glee. I thought I was very happy. I guess I shouldn't have been right. It's very sad, it really happens. some of the family name property property. But I'm quite sure why I felt such a glee, but I'm still very happy as you can see. I think what it is, is that I've been covering this process for now six months, in the serious political people, dull and Clinton anyway, present this slick facade, is entirely falling. So that whenever anything  this that's seemingly authentic, happens, it comes as an enormous relief. Disassembles? with the glimpse of reality. And you feel  their best laid plans have been completely shattered by their advisors' desire to get laid. You can't help it dwell on. I mean, prepare that one instant to the entire Democratic Convention. And which is more interesting, which will people talk about? There's no question people can talk about big morris in the process. And what did they have been talking about at the convention during their campaigns at what is wrong? that would have provided a counter. Well, , I just imagine if it's been, this is having a different time. Or it's time when the major parties were seriously grappling major social problems. If someone was talking about things  the mal-distribution well, or the need for universal health care, or big social problems and addressing them in an interesting way, that be at least some counterweightiness, that be something I should want. to talk about is nothing. It's been said at the Democratic Convention that you cared at the law on, right instead in the Democratic Convention, it's all just, let's not get kids to smoke. And it's a parade of unobjectionable sentiment and small issues rather than big right. That's not frightened people, let's just, it's just kind of low level license. That which I find really unpleasant. It's interesting to be paying it to 92 because I remember in 92 when the Jennifer. and the finalist story came out. One of the spins that was put in it, I remember was precisely James Carval, saying, look, you can talk about the sex to follow you and what we're talking about is national healthcare. That's what we're talking about. And it worked. People are interested in big issues. And if you confront the society head on and talk to it directly about things that the concern is deeply, people won't be that distracted by the other things. I mean, it's, And you can see in kind of a maturation in the electorate with regard to packet delos that I think all sorts of reasons for this. But Bill Clinton has been the great educator that we don't need our politicians to be saints. Are you surprised what you found once you went out and followed the campaigns around as much as you have? Well I've always thought of myself as a good democrat. It's probably more true to say that it was a good liberal, but I'm having this very weird experience. and covering the campaign, actually getting close to politics. , I've never really done until six months ago. And I think I know now what it feels  to be an adolescent boy who discovers that he's more sexually attracted to boys and girls. That I'm discovering, here I've gotten to this process, thinking I'm a Democrat, and I'm discovering that I'm more attracted to Republicans than Democrats, thinking maybe I'm a Republican. So I'm just just sorting this out. Why have these feelings? And maybe I'll put off. a few months of therapy and some discussion with friendly camera crafts, maybe I'll come around. But why do you think you're having these things? What is it because of their ideas? Are you agreeing with them on the school voucher and on the 15% tax? No, you see, this is what's so strange about it. Is that I still disagree with them as much as ever. I just , , I found it more, that generally more truthful, easier to learn more from them. And I also feel  it's easier to have enough. open discussion and disagree with the democrats in maybe because they're in power in the White House and covering presidential campaign. This always feels  this their careers are a stake around talking. Whereas with the number of the republicans who I've been writing about, I feel  they just talked to them in making sense to me where we disagree with this agreement. CDP  that that's also a function of the fact that the republicans are themselves more the party of ideas and more trying to work after. is of what it means to be a conservative, just a minimum or a little bit of aitarian, doesn't mean that you're more fiscal conservatives, meaning you're more Christian, Christian right? Oh, I think that's very true. I think it's completely true. Most of the interesting debate is being taking place in the Republic of Korea. I mean, where is the interesting debate about welfare? It should be in the democratic party, and it's not happening. There is a war in the Republic of Korea, maybe the reward you got, or a fortune? and about all sorts of related social issues. There were Republicans who will find out with Jack Camp about supply side of economics and on the Democrats side. Well, my feeling in the Democrats side is just right now. It's all about winning. There aren't no debate as a lot will happen until after November. It's very shallow in the Democrats side. Not very interesting. You don't sit down with Democrats and have interesting discussions with the policy. Michael Lewis, he won a good time pick up his book, Liars Poker, he's assembling his campaign diaries and a new book. Let me have some tea. Everybody knows the voice singing, Everybody knows that the captain light, Everybody's got his broken demon,  the former all the doctors died, Everybody's hands are in their pockets, Everybody wants a box that champ lights, AllZoms dang, everybody knows Back 3. Neighbors. We probably heard at this point about the multimillion dollar cleanup. Chicago is done for the convention. Along the route between the downtown hotels, especially in the United Center, which convention itself. But one night after the convention, I jumped into a cab with some other people, some strangers. We sped up Monroe Street, then doing her hotels, me back to the radio studio. Moom was out, air was perfect, Street was freshly paved. And one? from Washington DC, Alobius who had attended the convention in a skybox, remarked, Chicago is so wonderful, , pot holes, the homeless people, and the weather is so beautiful. I don't even know where to begin with that. I mean, I did not know that money could buy that amount of misinformation and misperception. I did not know. It was possible to create that, I mean, I'm not sure  about the weather, right? She's just as wrong about the hot holes in the homeless people. For our next story is about our multimillion dollar civic cleanup. You may remember the bestselling book there are no children here from the years back. In there are no children here. Right or Alex Cobbowitz described the lives of two brothers at Humreburner Homes. And the book was made into a TV film by Oprah Winfrey. You can mention many times and speeches by Jack Kim, others. Well, Heming Warner is the public housing project that sits directly across the street from the United Center. And when Chicago did its multimillion dollar cleanup for the Democratic Convention, it cleaned up some a corner, as part of it. Well, the boys from Alex Kotowitz' book are now young men and they don't actually live cornering more. They're good at it. And one of them, Pera Walt, who's now 18, pretty good at this story, gives us a little tour of what has changed at Warner because it didn't venture. What has changed? When I left here in one of five years ago, it looked  a ghost town, no green grass, broken Wendy's, pretty everywhere. Now here in one of the different places. There are rows of flowers outside of the maintenance building, and new windows in the office where all muddries, green, there are trees, new elevators, most of the changes are on the side of the building that faced the United States, and all Washington Street, all burning schools used to be. There's a new playground. She's a big lot, you use new blue and green jungle gene. Nice to have any playground I've ever seen in the city, even on a north side, and everyone knows why. I  it, it's fun, I know what I did, I got a grandson in the car. You did, you got to take his kids and then get a kid in the car. The present is so. People say a lot of other things too, and not all of them makes sense. what can you how to tell me about the playground? That's it. Did the questions mean something good to come and nobody can be shown that this year Yeah, cause one has a 7-7-year-old girl who's done because he won 6-year-old mom then get a doctor and be a love-pice in our field and present it was in our field People have learned about physical change most of them say their man that took a present before the city was clean up a parking lot or climb that tree Something's a hair with what I've seen. Something's a stir-side. shooting and hot day. When I was a kid, I was running the house when the shooting started. Saying where my nephew snuggles in his friend's ear, I'm sitting. Oh wait, time to shoot on hot day and start, gay bang. , the hot day, they all the kids that brought the help. Right. I'm going to shoot. I'm going to shoot. and act . But I'm dead now, you're dead. Let me show you now, tell you. Usually when you hear about the projects, you hear the things I've had and they get in words. But when I went to Hona, I heard a different story. There are still students, still drug, still gang. But mostly people tell. things to slow down. In 1991, the residents of Amin Hone felt a lawsuit against the city and won because of that the Chicago housing authorities painted it up renovated all the part, putting it in new elevator, turned down the worst building. They moved 230-35 years out of Hone's in 1995 and installed 24-hour security car. Our friends here they told me she feels safe. We have a list of that in California here. looking around here so, oh, Pran, I was stopped a lot that I took. And he goes in  shooting or not so, let's go. Oh, these around are more or so, that's that I took since they put that right so that they go out straight along. Sivian says police always drap and around neighborhood since the United Sandops. Now, this is my grandma and she says the same thing that things are getting back. We sent her a farm, a fostered music on radio and a preacher on the television. And she told me about. my corner. With this net to bat around here, I never read about nothing happening around here,  somebody gets killed in that shoot. It's not too bad. I walk out after this house every day and don't go, it's , it's be out. I have to take a place to get a place to get a lot of faith. And a lot of faith. Of course I got it wrong first. One of the things that the president and the delicacy of the potential won't see when he look as one of the common prophets, 90 centiphartha, not. If the boy is a tourist clerk, physically the boy is in the village clerk has a change since I was lit. Old pool table, a basketball court, centiplock wall, is not in great shape. I talked to the grandfather of Newton, Nage Am, he's worked at the boy. in Gura's Club 40 years. Everybody knows everybody respects. Kids will listen to names for 40-lissots to teach or parents or even a police. He's the only person in a corner who can walk into the middle of a gang fight and make a stop. In fact, he's famous for jumping into the middle of fight. And major will be the first person to tell you about all the fights and the stuff. He's got a jump on eight guys with these three nights. I didn't know yet three nights, but he has one in his hand. He's going to get you guys. So I did wear this guy. take this knife away from the guy came out there. 12 was a gentleman one guy and maybe so man that's what look. I'm gonna take all 12. We got one at a time and I take one at a time and I hope all 12 was done with do it by myself. I picked him up and told him over the fence. Tell you, you got something to say. Maybe we were safe because over 200 families moved out. They are pure people to get in trouble. I should be sure. I pray and save this says people have less time. I'm the cooler around because the housing authorities are high residents to do construction and clean up place up. Another friend of mine says people are getting their acts together because now the city is keeping people out and seeing their buildings down and they don't want to lose their home. The way major sees it and maybe it's better because there are people on one and we'll try to make a difference. How to show you time have been down in our neighborhood. This neighborhood. Because you have a guy  me working in the neighborhood. So you walk in your violin gangbanks, this came out of there. So there's a lot of things I do for my violin play basketball. I only want to go back to school. I see a big old back to school. The older jail, I send them money stuff  this. I'm merely saying, you can't do the kind of outside on the inside and right. Major is working hard to do the kind of inside. And the main room at the poison girus club, there's a trophy carry. Inside there are all the trophies one back on, a baseball team, basketball team, football team. And Pian said the back of the trophy carry, there are pitches of corner residents who've made something up their life, who can't matter if the project went on to do great things. All three of those young men are there at teach you, and you're a community. A joke of Amirainstrushis. And this is Dr. Stephen Parker, as she calls her state. As worthy from earth women's fair, the antipontal out of nine spots and acts me for a pitch is we have seen. I was going to make it. If you're a waltz, is a senior at Culver Academy in Indiana? Yes, it's just a question of this song. story south above the guill situation very try to survive try to stand alone go Even though the streets are lucky, lights burn out, they'll freeze out, they'll hide in the mouth, All the school buttons not do it right, every day is the same, this is the same, every night, I wouldn't shoot you, bro, but I shoot them, who would be late in the post, try to test my clothes, Every day I wanted just how I got, only thing I know is how to survive, this only one, bro. I'm going to the real world, let's take care of you, you're a big deal with the hearts I've there today, my deal with the ghost. Back for TV show. Danny Drennan is as far as we can tell and expert on two things in this world. Worldwide web and TV show Beverly Hills 902 will know I click with my miscible time to the ridiculous here. He created one of the more interesting and eccentric pages on the word web that we wrap up Ōvnant. He writing about television and…. the way that no one else does and a couple weeks ago we asked him to review a Bob Dolop appearance when Bob Dolop here in America came right, but this week, we asked him to review the VemPet National Adventure. So I'm watching the Democratic National Convention the other night on C-SPAN. And let me just say how thankful I am that C-SPAN exists. the best part of the convention is when everyone is going home and all the other networks have moved on to other things, but there's good old, gavled-a-gavled C-SPAN still filming every last bit. So the thing is, with teenage convention volunteers, who are... She refused entrance to one of the goard orders because she didn't have her ID with her. And C-Span also does this great phone interview thing where people from Canada can call up and tell America how much they hate our political conventions. how about you mind your own business up there in Canada and stop reminding us that liberal is not an epithet in Canada and about gun control on Canada and about healthcare in Canada and about all the other things the Democrats should be doing here that already exist in Canada. I'm totally convinced that people from the Canadian in tourist board or whatever, a constantly calling up C-Span pretending to be interested in American politics to try and convince Americans to move up North. And the other thing I  about C-Span is that it gets all the unscripted bits, Hillary Clinton waiting for her cue to start talking, but then jumping the gun and then stopping, and then going great under her breath totally angry. And then starting again and delivering her lines all deadpan,  so ticked off that she just made a fool of herself on live television. So later on we get a big old tribute. to form a commerce secretary Ron Brown, with a video of people saying nice things about Ron Brown, and then his widow, Alma Brown, talking about her husband. But then all of a sudden we switch to the Alma Brown variety hour, because in the middle of talking about her deceased husband, Alma Brown up and introduces Henny G, by how scary is that? To be talking about your dead husband one minute, and then to have to introduce some god-awful white jazz musician in the next. if you combine the Lawrence Welch Show with Rod Serling's Night Gallery, you would get Alma around introducing Kenny G at the Democratic National Convention. And if I were Kenny G, I would seriously fire my agent,  the only gigs that Kenny G gets are the Democratic National Convention and Kelly Taylor's birthday party on Beverly Hills 90210. And even more upsetting perhaps is the whole Hollywoodization of a political process. I mean, can I just ask how much plastic surgery did that house minority leader guy Richard get heart have done? And how many so-called Hollywood stars could they bring in to speak during the convention? Edward James Almo's who came up with the most brilliantly uptoose quote of the evening when he said, and I quote, the complexity of this question is so intense that I could never try to attempt to answer it. That is a direct quote, but what does that mean? And do I really need Edward James Almo's passionately giving me a definition of what dishing means? And so much it also probably talked to Christopher Reeves manager. I mean, I hate to say it, but how much in common with so-called people does a rich overpapers? covered by health insurance actor who broke his neck while enjoying some totally elitist equestrian sport have. And maybe the producers of this convention who also produced the Oscars where we've also appeared gave Chris for Reeve  a three-engagement dealer something. Or maybe Chris for Reeve just sells his Neilson share to the highest bidder. And let me just say if I had to labor with every single solitary breath just to speak three words at a time and then wait because everyone in the audience takes that as a cue to clap even though I haven't finished my point yet. I sure is how wouldn't waste that breath on Bill Quentin. So then we get about 5 million people plugging Hillary Clinton's book, and then later the convention moves on to the politically-experient death and personal medical catastrophe part of the show, exemplified by Al Gore's kid and sister and every other speaker this evening. there's nothing about Quentin that tubs our hard strengths, so they have to bring in all these death and tragedy stories that have absolutely nothing to do with him. And so then we see Sarah Brady and her husband Jim. And I'm sure that's our breath. already meant well, moving her husband gym around the convention stage  a living political prop, and talking about the Brady Bill and gun control. But if you look at Bill Clinton's track record so far, you might worry that gun control is just another step in Bill Clinton's goal to declare a national state of emergency and establish Marshall Law in this country. he already was to set up her views and he's already responsible for the biggest increase in FBI wire tapping in American history, and he was to take away guns, and he was to put more cops on the street. And the political protesters at the convention were supposed to be. be content with receiving a lot of redarive, a lot of time for them to protest. , at someone, please poem me into the moment in time when the Constitution of the United States started parsing out the first amendment on a time-sharing basis. , are we going to have alternate side of the street freedom of speech at some point soon? And this is from the Democrats. And if you think I'm crazy, just count the number of times that Bill Clinton mentions a 20th century a new technology. , how annoying is it when Bill Clinton goes on and on about wanting to hook up every school to the self? called information superhighway. When in reality the internet is a huge dumping route of useless information. I mean kids can't even read or write but let's hook them up to the biggest ways of technology going. Of course only after we censor it. And if I were paranoid I would say that Bill Clinton is in fact big brother who wants to preside over a hugely illiterate population tied into the government by a government censored internet links, gunless and with cops at every street corner, entertained and sedated by Hollywood has been in order to pave the way. for a beast of the apocalypse one world government takeover and maybe moving Canada isn't such a bad idea after.
