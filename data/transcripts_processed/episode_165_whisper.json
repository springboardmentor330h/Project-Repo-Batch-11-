It was in five. So David said so explain what we are. We're at the Lou. And this is a close to 7th of a calm I've never set foot. Never set foot inside the Lou. So you flew to Paris for Taiwan? Two years. But I still haven't visited. I didn't see the point. Welcome to Paris and go to the one place where you're not allowed to smoke. As a matter of fact, my goal to be the only person who's come to Paris since he's never set foot in the woods. If you listen to it, I'm probably about a 12 minute walk, 15 minute walk from the low. When I'm close to Notre Dame, too, but I've never fallen in there on. I think there's just an interest. I mean, I think so many people come here and they feel  they have to do certain things because somebody told them to do whatever they're going to go home and people are saying, what do you mean? You didn't see the pan there. What do you mean? You didn't go into the low. So guessing that good number of these people are just standing here because somebody told them that they should do it. But you don't think that they're all museum-goers at home. I don't know. The people who  to look back and remember the experience of standing and kind of peating? I remember eating something, or buying something, or seeing something  an accident, or somebody who's really twisted up in some way. But no, let me get a painting. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe just qualify it this for them. It doesn't get any better than this. But I don't know. I just want people that I know that have come here.

But if he wanted to know the best place to buy a model of Latin tooth or collection of beaches or life-sized. replica of a human head with the top cut off so you can see it's inside. David did show me that. This is a pretty good medical supply store. Look, these body parts that they have here. Their hand made and hand painted, and they're not new, these expensive ones. You see what things that they would be. Look at that, Mr. Brechen, a stomach. Oh, back bone, I got a red back bone. Made out of paper mache for Christmas, and I think it probably cost about $60, which was a great price for a back bone.

One, his boyfriend here had to run down housing in the day. And two, why not? Over the course of two years, he has written extensively about him. experience. It's always for the radio for magazines, of course newest book. In his stories David portrays life in Paris as a series of humiliations and near-human relations. And if you hang out with him for a few days, you realize he is not exaggerating much. This is my worst nightmare right here. He's barely gone in three blocks from his apartment and are walking towards Paris and he's stopped on the sidewalk. Okay, my lighter is running out of fluid. Fluid, which is mean that I would have to ask somebody. for a match and so what I would say is hello do you have some fire but I and I so hate saying that that I usually carry  we're  there's something so I always have a backup so it's pretty good to be back here extra cigarettes I know I'm  a lighter in here and we'll not spend the afternoon asking people if they have fire I was curious about David's thoughts about this, precisely because he was never somebody, who had any special feelings from the place. He didn't move here, he was head over on his timing line, broke through the stine, sarch, and cruised. He was applying to sleep. And so for several hours every day I was in Paris, David would walk me to the places of times when it's interesting. And the first thing I learned is this, it is so traumatic to learn a new language that a lot, David's experience in the city. Amen. This person on G.F.F. Paris has to do simply with where people are cruel to him when he speaks somewhere they aren't. This is a hardware store where the owner and the people who work there are really really nice to me I I think see all the time my by things that I don't even need just because They're so kind and they generally just start laughing right when I walk in the door Many owner were called systems out of the background and say he's bad. He's bad and I buy things I bought a heating element for so I could make tea in my hotel room because I had to go to Germany so I can go and say hello I am looking for a stick that make the water hot today so I say really stupid things when I go in there but I I only say it in French but they're incredibly good sports I bought an ironing board and I was able to say hello it is been three weeks I bought an iron now today I look for a table that might work with my iron. Have you such a table? You said, oh, an ironing board. And went and got one out of the back. He's really, really nice. It's a place I can always count on, or somebody's going to be good to me. Do you want to walk in the harbour store? Do you want anything? Do they sell batteries? Yeah. Could you get me some double-A batteries for the camera? Yeah. 24. Okay. It's a tiny store. Just enough room for a few customers. a story that's taller than it is wide, which shall be useful in merchandise running up to the ceiling. Plus, rooms, feather dusters, baskets, so we hang over our heads. You're a tree-fire pot from the end of the stack. That's a good one. Oh, wow. How many are there? I don't know what you're saying. How many are there? We're talking about the air, right? Ah, that's right. Well, this is my name. He's the very documentary. The magazine. He's the one who writes this straight to. This is my boyfriend, David says. Trying to say this is my friend. He is making a documentary of my life He tapes everything Oh, so please your shares they peel do blah We pay this small talk and we'll back on the street less than a minute and how see that's what's so nice about that guy All right, I went in and he said I would see me for a long time He's been on vacation and that's just the worth of world That is so incredibly nice for some somebody to to notice your absence. Some chapkeepers don't notice him. He'd been buying his newspaper from the same woman in his neighborhood seven days a week for over a year. And recently she said to him, how do the blue? Are you a tourist during vacation? I said, I've been coming here and buying my newspaper. Every day for the last 19 months no one not on vacation. I have an apartment around the corner. So it took that long, it's been even too acknowledge. The cheat scene made me before. But that's why I got there every day. I was waiting for that moment. I've heard it recognize you. We're going to a chocolate shop and bookstore and cafe. And each place we go. There's a little conversation. Just normal small talk and goes okay. He's really polite. He can recite it all from the afterwards line by line. When he first moved here, when his friends' class wasn't going so well, he was constantly being scolded by him, not understanding the simplest things, directions, prices, but the proper change. People hear are crazy about exact change, swears to me. He realized at some point that he could make it all feel better if he transformed himself, from the inept foreigner to the inept foreigner with a charge card. People will be really nice to you if he spent a lot of money. And then I just started going out and buying things. Kind of a bad day in school. I'd go out after school and buy a desk. Or , pricey lamps. Because people were unfailingly nice while I was writing out that chat. And I would say the most screwed up thing. And then we'd say, oh, you speak so well. And it would compliment me. And I would feel so good. And then I would leave. And I would think, wait a minute. I took a while to get that under control. So feel  you're just  observing your day as an outsider. If I could do something to this position, where the smallest human acts of kindness have turned out to mean so much. To have words before there were things that I didn't really think about. It doesn't take much to make me happy now. Whereas before I feel  it took quite a bit. He's your experience here at the moment of adventure, or more of feeling of accumulation. It's more of feeling of humiliation. It would be a feeling of adventure at the power of more adventures, but it's  for me to get on a train and go to Switzerland. I don't think, oh good, I get to have an adventure. I think, oh great, I get to make an asset of myself into different languages. That's what I wind up doing in Germany. They always include breakfast with your hotel. I'm not a breakfast leader, but I want to come off here something. We stated this, I stated that hotel in Germany, I don't remember the town. The last time I was there, so I go downstairs to have my breakfast in New York. Six people seated at a table and usually they've got lots of tables, but here there's only one table and I'm thinking I don't really want to sit with six people, but if I turn around leave the nothing that I'm doing rude So I've gotten this far so I have to sit down at the table with these six people So I pull out a chair and the man says something to me in German and I say oh No, just coffee for me. I'm fine with that. I'm when he was trying to tell me was that I was in his kitchen This was the kitchen owner and this was the owner of the hotel in his and his family sitting down the breakfast. I just saw this door and I opened it and I was in their quarters and then he had to go and wake up his nine-year-old. So his nine-year-old comments blamed him in English that in fact the dining room was downstairs. So I don't see that because I didn't see it as an adventure it just happened. David Mooth here at a particular moment in his life. After years of making his living. containing apartments, caring furniture. He finally had published books, made the best sellers, it was on the radio. One on tours, and so, 2005, and 2005, people who wanted to hear and read. And I think most people are built to take only so much of that. I have people think that was somebody. I think for most people, people who are not hopeless either, in any case, there is a normal balance and has to happen. I believe in it or somebody, people eat in it or know God. There's a ratio of balance that has to happen in most people's heads. I've known David for 10 years and I think that what happened to him is that the somebody side of that equation got crazy and fantasticly insane. So the nobody side had to hyperinflate to catch up and had to balance out. If a nation of book buying adults was going to tell him how great he was back home, he needed an entire second nation of adults, reminding him that really how important was it? that's exactly what it is.. When I do go back, it's not  going from, I don't know, having an audience to being anonymous. It's beneath, I mean, it's beneath the plan of the A. It's going from having an audience to being a former, which is the lowest life to be a former. When you were a kid, were you playing Q-mini at a time? Yeah, , it's had, did one open my mouth because I was less. and I sounded  the girl. So I'm sorry, it's not  it's a feeling that I'm new still. Really the feeling that I get here is more comfortable to me. One day David takes me to a cafe and you guys do all the time, often alone. And I'm surprised when he tells me that he is somebody new. Until recently, had trouble going to a restaurant or a cafe. by himself. Just get a cup of coffee. Because I'm always afraid that they're not going to see me there. And then I'm just, we stocked there. Another people will say, look, they're, , he's waiting on that guy. He's been here for half an hour. He isn't going to let them sell. I get terribly self-conscious in this situation. Me, you? I'm not scared of it from sitting in a restaurant alone that they want to see me. I assume that that'll see me and that the way not bad. , it's a business and they need... the money and they're usually waiting. No, but I'm always convinced that I don't see me and they're not going to wait on me. And it seemed to happen to me so many times in my life that I would go into a place and then you have to be kind of  you're leaving of your own violation. you've been waiting for somebody and then you look at your watch. , don't block us or not going to show them. It's going to sit around here and wait any longer. And you make this whole little play that you do. I really know what he's watching, but it's very elaborate. And then you can get out, get up and leave. is , you're sweating, you're sitting there and you think that other people are watching. In such a way that they will think, oh, that guy hasn't gotten made it on. In fact, on ideal, I look at people  that. And I know this wouldn't happen to other people. And because I look at things  that, that I imagine everybody else is. This turns out to be quite a burden to carry into a fine country. If somebody does something stupid in front of him, David says, he goes home right to down. Pals his friends sometimes turns it into a story that he reads in front of thousands or tens of thousands of strangers. And so, when he says something stupid in French, which he does daily, he believes that it is possible that shopkeepers and readers just shrug it off and everything about it again. But it seems test is possible that they go tell their friends and laugh at them. That's why I get so embarrassed of the way that I speak, it's because I go home and I write everything down. That's the way I am. I assume that everybody else. that way as well. We walked through the places that David likes best in Paris, and it's  hopping from one to sweet island, David had already explored, found to be safe, human habitation, to the next dispute island. I think this is the way that anybody gets to know any new city, especially a city where you do not speak the language. You try one place, and then you try second place, and you return to those places over and over. Slowly expanding your territory, to get to the include more. little spots of the return. The places data takes me to usually had one of these characterist steps. They were fantastically unusual and interesting things to buy. They were places of a type which simply do not exist in the United States. The places where the French was usually very simple. Get me who! Often the smell of cousins of children. At the Luxembourg Gardens there's an old puppet theater where we see treasure of the saltings. It's  watching it. art form, the sturdy and indestructible as the cockroach. Slaps dick, the menacing character sneaking up behind our heroes' backs, everybody yells and warning. It always comes up point where he hits somebody with a heavy stick. And the kids just eat it up. when he starts, people at the stair, they go bananas. I've seen probably, this is a foretime. I've seen the treasure of this althons. I just  coming because it makes me so happy to be around. people who are self-happiness. After the princess is saved from the pirates, and the friendly tiger is rescued from the savage jungle, conviven Paris. We head outside the carousel. We're six year olds who strap onto wooden horses, and handed little wooden sticks. Play again the days to 16th century Europe, possibly early, adjusting, where they try to spear a dangling ring while speeding by on horseback. David also takes me to one of the tiny mom and pop theaters in his neighborhood. A whole culture of movies is giving Paris. Hundreds of films showing all sorts of movies, new and all. I should have a place to have him fly there, kiss lavish, fly by the moon. David sees me every day in Paris. He also takes me to the flea market to open every weekend, now it's going to be city. Dispaling Warren's booths, selling old paintings, watches, and what amount to five centuries of coffee table? situations. I find it a nice one store from the early days of telephones, just to keep a cone room, sign to be attached to a telephone inside a theater. So you find way at home, it's supposedly listened in on the concert, play, over the telephone. And if I can't sign it out, all principles, proper mic phone placement. But that was in the highlight of our food market trip. There was most places here where people have their booth and I guess I was here to shop engaged in books. Christmas. , oh my god. That's Judge Judy. That's Judge Judy without white, oracle. I love Judge Judy, and that was her right there. She was just listening. No, if you watch her show, you get the idea that, , saying something, bottoms and be  that is so appropriating. That's what she does for a living is tell people to the rack and inappropriately. But she's relieved that we somehow. I love Judge Judy so much. I wish that she would run from here if New York. Wow Judge Judy. Tell your biggest celebrity, yeah, saying it in a while in Paris. I saw Catherine D'Innerves. But Judge Judy's better than Catherine D'Innerves. It's awesome. This square up here. This is a pantheon. And again, I've never been inside of it, but I know that all kinds of famous foreign people are in tune here. , I don't know. I think Paul's actually here are people  that,  Billy, super famous writers, but I've never set foot inside, but I  the frozen grocery store that's a cost of street gen-grade drinks, something else? The story is part of a chain, it's all over friends, it's called the car, everything they sell is frozen. And they've got this method freezing, the most thing we have in the United States, they take it freeze lettuce, and they've got everything in there from me to frozen soups and spices, but it's not  TV dinners,  you can buy a little packet of ostrich chops, or a horse meat, or duck legs, stuffed with crumbs, sausage. and there's all these simplistic facts, so it's not, they take in the stigma out of person but, and every print person I talk to swears by this story, especially people who have kids, because the food is really really good and if you open one of these United States, you would just be minting money, you wouldn't be able to count on this stuff, I guarantee you, it would be such a huge success. Inside, it is exactly what you want from the traveling foreign country. Every object is familiar, a package is represented in the way that is pleasing me. new and exotic. So it's all comprehensible, but at the same time, happily found. And the foods walk that disturbing, but fascinating line that farm foods can have, between looking delicious and looking frightening. Snals, packed and green stuff in their shells of many different sizes, coalesce full of massive frozen prey fish that we either about to come back to life. To be made chiskebabs, arcebuko, pick up a few things, and then down the hill to step at the regular supermarket for quick run to the dairy kids. See you. Scamed of Amelastina who's so ashamed of the body that he said was going dinner. And he held this brand of clutter right up to my face and told me I'm never ever a lot of light again. So I'm here to replace that butter. We were kind of buttered to do pie. It was this bit it's grand jury brand of butter of Brittany. I don't know that about that anymore. What? Because you said he's really picky about things  that. He said, I saw a eyebrow putting that butter on bread and he had  four pieces of bread. I'm so embarrassed, but it was awful. And I said, I want to only think that I was going to go home and write in his little notebook dinner here when David's butter was terrible. That's what you're wrong, my friend. No, the listeners, if you eat at here in David's. I'm going to wait the better. 31-rude bathed the time of wooden spiral staircase to a store that's been in operation since 1831. They were all, which they because the Noah's heart and taxidine. The kangaroo from this, there's two iron bars, about five different varieties of monkeys are high enough. The pair is a branch, a palm of bear, and a beautiful oak case containing different reptiles, snakes and lizards. I live in Austria, in the Austria, just white and non-feet tall. It's really neck. We work with room after room, but with pigs and lions, hatch and dogs. The dogs. especially real-encomment. Some of them were going to run into the place to stuff either owners who had never had the hard to come up. The price to buy an ostrich or a lion or gorilla is nearly $10,000 to rent them for two days is 420 bucks in the American. Most of the business is rent. David buys a magpie black and powerful and sleek looking and we had done the street. So do you have things  this when you were a kid? My mother had a great aunt who's yelling. person and my family who really had any money. She was married to a man who was a big game partner. She'd come to our house to visit her very young, but I only went to her house once. So right before she died, she had a trophy room. There were all kinds of animals in their extinct animals. There were snow leopards in there. There were white tigers in there. And you would walk into this perfect room. And there were thousands of eyes staring at you. And I just thought this is what I wanted. That's the thing that I love, and that's the feeling you get when you go into a day roll that all of these creatures that are stuffed and poised to pounds, that they're all staring at you. The same feeling you get from being in front of an audience. The same feeling you get in front of an audience. Look at that, people are looking at it. But these are creatures that are looking at you. You're that ceiling. feeling that it's a very watching him. David, of course, thinks about that feeling of eye, especially here in France, but he wonders what Griesen's thing, as they watch him, speaking so badly. But it's not entirely so high that they always stage fun, going about how to say every little thing, anxious, and straining to understand all the words around him. Except, thinking that makes me feel alive, and it makes me notice everything around me. come from places  I was in the United States. , you just get used to things, so you don't think about it. You don't do you think I'll get a cab all. You've got to the airport, I'll have a patty milk. You don't think about it. Whereas now with me the anxiety starts early on and I'm always afraid that someone's going to throw me a purve ball and ask me a question,  what's inside of you? Just ask me a question  that, I don't know where. And I'll appear foolish. So it keeps me on edge. But really that that aginess has always made me feel alive. Someday David says, it'll be more comfortable in French. He's excellent on proof and that daily anxiety will be removed from his life. And when it is removed from me, then I probably won't be able to sit and live in here anymore. I'll probably live. Because there'll be just  living back home. Plus the more you learn, the more disappointed you want that thing. It's easy to  somebody when you don't know what they're saying. It's interesting ahead of that, that not understanding somebody makes them seem more interesting than they really are. I just assume that everyone talked about books and movies all the time. All they talked about, as far as I was concerned. And then I learned a little bit more and I realized that they're no different than people anywhere else. They talked about the same, but now things that we all talked about everywhere. At the cafe David goes to all the time, we sit in much a way to the David and watch. Billy Bernoulli dares to say a word to him. The waiters in his mid-Ford is the kind baggy face you should be acting with the scare fellow in the music box, very bolder. And the waiters kind of cut up, hangs out with the regulars, making them laugh at this and that. That's what makes him fun to watch. What do you want to do though? What do you want to do? When you were that guy lives, how much money he makes. He's married. He's not married. you don't wonder about everybody. They don't know who he's wondering about that guy. He makes his bet. But now things are good for David and he has. He still feels curious about everything. But at figuring out what long means. And then makes everything. So interesting all the time. The mystery has not ever been made today. Grey şekilde is Columbine. It was  a tail and people drank on the job. He's belling the bar, he's drinking wine. Smell the cigarette and he's picking his nose. That's a big, big, big. Those are three good races to list, right? It's , hey. If it's to derous, let's put the bellarces called Me Talk Pretty One Day. Let me up, a couple of radio host who does not speak French and he goes more foreign words in a minute. Just talk about the radio when our program continues. I'm Eric Glass, American Life, the radio program that dares to ask the question. Ola du, loss  Basilbia Lucy I've never understood why anybody cares so much about finance. I mean, it's fine, it's lovely, but there is just this thing that some Americans have for Paris. Though, as they are the first internet, it can be kind of ridiculous. Well, when people ask me where I live, I sometimes say Paris and I say well I mean you live in Paris but that's my dream. Kristen Hohnodon's lived in Paris for five years. what you live in Paris and as well  I just wanted to. All the reasons that you give sound really embarrassing cliché. In the ridiculous at this point I mean Paris is a stale dream and it's kind of falling in love with the most obviously cute boy in the class or   the star of this  a movie starts I think a group. And then you try to convince the other sort of 25 women who be slept with the last week. Well, , I really love it. I think he loves me too. There are some people who come here and they sort of get off on that feeling of being. They think they're unusual because they put themselves in this position to me. That's really kind of all in the affairs. really special. Yeah, they think it makes them special to live here as if it's a isn't it's original and be part of the horrifying thing about moving here. , it's a sh... it's a... sh... it's a pretty experience to realize that... your dream is so banal. I mean, this is a dream I had my whole life and it seems ridiculous to me now that it meant so much to me. It's so important. The thing about loving a city for skin cells is that a city doesn't really love the back. Whenever I asked Americans about France, what it was about France that just got to me so much, I ended up getting to them and feeling that France. They all talked about scraps of French culture that made it to them when they were very young. The man-alien boats, the red-boiled French films, Montessori French class in grade school. I think there is still a part of America with the idea of Paris. Paris, not. the space program with the internet and moving to New York City, Harris represents reaching the world outside of the cell. Fritucan for started coming here as a teenager from a small town of Pennsylvania. And as essentially constructed an entire life around the feeling that he got pasted. He went on to become a scholar and director of the Roman Studies Department of Hornet University, other several books, EFAT, and cigarettes or sublime, which are deeply confused with the sensibility that is partly just unamera for anyway semi-poo. the reason. The sensitivity that is all about the small pleasures of the day life. Now, the French have a much more uncomfortable, uncomfortable, uncomfortable and much less guilty relationship to their body, getting with a feed. I mean, I don't know the way they can the American Ocean that feed is met so it's totally possible to put it to the French and yet increasingly from the American, from the American. here and people keep almost a function of what they think is good for it. I mean nobody friends, strictly is a function of good for them. Okay, I think really the harder it was for me when I came here and it was the first time it was , I was the simple marketplace right in the heart of Paris, not far from where we are. And remember, I used to go there not every night, but pay a bill. And then around two talking morning, you would kind of go out in the streets and lay all the streets of the Central Market. And then you should bring all the food every night, the trucks would bring the potives and food from all over France, the center of Paris, the heart of Paris, and they lay it on the streets, all around the streets, butchers were there, sort of blood splattered, out of sin. People made gorgeous piles of other jokes and carrots. and it was two o'clock in the morning and it was  life was just beginning at that hour. And people were there sort of buying and selling and then right next to the hour was La Hussain de Nique. La Hussain de Nique was the center of partition of house. And the people who worked there would work until 4 o'clock in the morning. and they were different velocities somewhere or almost night. But this world, , is incredible, sort of life and food and sex and beauty and middle of one of the most beautiful parts and all these parts of the past, but it used to be in 12  the 19th century, the biggest cemetery in the subject in the past. The one grand pass with the truth. He's constantly pointing out spots that had special meaning to glue the 14. Or there's a restaurant that happened to be one of the first restaurants ever built in France just after they began the idea of restaurants. For the shops, with the notion of putting big huge windows and the front of stores probably began as people could window shop. Practice a lot of what is so pleasing about being in Paris is simple. It's a really interesting, pleasing place just to walk around. The Christian Horanautal tried last year to live back in the States again. Some people also played the temples to molecular jetting but they didn't help Tsk's You'd be kind of hard to get ordinary things done in France. You're always kind of an outsider here, even if you're years in the country. But you just lose better here. , you walked down the street in Los Angeles and you feel well. I'm in this terrible example because the Los Angeles, but you feel kind of torfed and here I just think, yes, this is exactly it. This is how life should be. At the pace, the scale, the wet looks. HECK 3. It's a venative daughter. Janet McDonald's, the daughter of the language, she's already going to the culture. Head French friends and French apartment. What's something happened that made her realize how much she hadn't figured out? I was going to the movies with a friend of mine from Yale who lives the lack also. And  there's a long line. And we were , let's jump the line. These white people are going to be scared. We'll just go and jump the line. We'll get to the front of the line. So of course, , you walk up to the front of the line, , yeah, you want to try me. I'm glad that usually works in New York. These people were ready to rip our hair out. And they were white. I couldn't believe it. They were , in French, what are you doing? The line stories back there. You can't just walk to the front of the line. They were , ready to kick our butts. I was shocked. I'm , these are white people and they're not scared of. That's when I realized I wasn't in Kansas anymore. And I liked it. I mean of course it was kind of a few million because we're supposed to be the intimidating scary ones and they're  all these  French bitches and high heels are threatening us and they were in our faces. And it made me realize that they're all  black, white game just doesn't work outside of the United States. Because white people aren't afraid of you here and at the same time they don't hate you because that sort of goes together. So I'll take it out wait on live. Now I don't dare to block it. So that opened my eyes. I don't dare to block it. Tenant Nair sitting in Cafe 4, one of the most famous and corneous and most pretentious settings in which to meet, because it and the domagal cafe next door were home to Sartre and Camoons and Simone de Beauvoir. And when he first arrived in Paris in 1946, Richard Wright, who's well known by them, is the author of Blackboy, New Sun. I mean now it's sort of a gathering place for tourists and one of these nostalgic fake friends people such as myself. It's classical cafe, and a corner with aging fixtures and playclass when there's on the street. Globally, but not on aim. By the time we tried to ride a ride here, Josephine Baker had come, seen, and conquered, Black GI said coming, and jazz had simply come. Bright road and a letter, who was such an absence of phrase-statured, it seems a little unreal. I wanted to talk to Janet because I wanted to find out if it was still that way from Paris. Inzy possible. May have centuries since those days, has been in inflexible  Africans difference. and they are not below. National Front Party, with the slogan, France, this were the French, when 15% of the national elections could it be possible that African Americans still get a warm reception here? Can I tell you, yes? I'm not sure what it is, all I know is it feels very different to be around French white people than American white people. It's no. I feel much more comfortable. I feel that I'm not a black object. Richard Wright, after arriving here in the 1940s, said that he felt that all of his life had been carrying a corpse with him. How many came to Paris? He thought it's the bath, is that... Did you have a... did you have a kind of film? Yeah, I really have to say that I have felt that way ever since I got here and it's a lot of my friends saying, Why are you living there? In fact, a friend of mine I went to law school with, he said, What is it about speaking French that makes life people not racist? It was very skeptical, but it really goes beyond that it's not just that we feel free of the burden of race. Because you're still blocked. I still experience myself as far as just if that's not on the center of my identity. It's not the first thing people relate to when I meet them here. Jennifer's came to Paris in 1975 and moved to... in 1995. She's a lawyer in the French office of the Big American Company. She grew up in the Public Housing Projects in Brooklyn, worked to weigh a divaster college in undergraduate school in law school. And  a lot of people who make the jump from very poor crime-written neighborhoods into the college educated upper middle class, she felt  she didn't really fit in anywhere. That was family and sons of the project who were shooting heroin very well surviving. That was the black student she met in college. I thought they were bourgeois, southern bals. I didn't want to do anything  them and they didn't want to be- me, but they thought I was trash. I was Project trash. I thought they were , they could be in Boji. And so I grappled a lot with that racial identity. What were my posture be on some of the projects? But people say I talk  a white girl. And then the white girls are , oh, you're so project. And then when I got here, no bit mattered because if I spoke three words of French that made sense, people liked me, they celebrated me. So I didn't have to. worried about talking  a white girl or a project girl or anything. It was an incredible movie. The central conflict of her life, suddenly vanished. In Paris, all the distinctions about what kind of black person should be, they were all moved. In fact, the most distinguishing fact about Janet was not that she was black. It was that she was in America. Which surprised her. I associate the word American with white guys, with flags on the lawn, so we didn't disagreeing on what you think. and people would call me a medic. Nice, I'll know a medic on black. And these were , black friends, people were , you are so American. And they, I remember these French West Indian friends of mine, this one took from art to make, was saying, we've been walking in America. I'm , what is an American walk ? And she said, they kick their legs when they walk, they kick their legs full. I don't know, I tell my friends. Because I was in Brooklyn just on the few weeks ago in this woman who'd never been to the business. So what's it  in France or they  one of the people ? They prejudice, I said, no, they  us. It's  incredible, a country full of white people, and they  us. But it's still, it's a difficult thing because they  us, but they don't  other people who looked  us. And that sort of is a friend to paradise. Of course, has its own house projects. in the suburbs of the surrounding city. Now with generations of Africans who were born in French soil, if they's job discrimination, housing discrimination. And they're not, well, we're Steve, they're not well, and then they are French. And so in a way, African Americans were in a very bizarre position. It's almost  being an honorary white and apartheid South African. And I noticed that  as my French app better and better But sometimes I wasn't as well received as I would be as I played up my American accent When French people had fight walking to a shop and people would think I was just basically why I say just another Just  one of their own from art unique or go out and lose It wouldn't be the same reception if I  came on for very heavy American accent or even spoken English Kind of. They treat with it. This is elephant! a little bit of a chill in the air. , yes, may I help you? Not so much, oh, was it a melee game? Oh, I love you, oh, I love you. I love to speak English, so it's very bizarre. It's a hard thing to reconcile because, I mean, good feeling is good feeling. And when someone who receives you and makes you feel good, you, it's a positive experience. When you're in a shop and you can feel that there's chill in the air, they think if you as an African, will you actually play up your American accent? Well, what happened was I started experiencing that and so I actually adjusted my speech so that at least I would get the benefit of , I mean I'm here and this country I want to get the benefit of being an African. So instead of... walking and we mandamujim interrassage to saw. I'd say we civil play as a vocu be made a. Maybe maybe I shouldn't do that. It works. Yeah, it works. A friend of China is a suggested tour, maybe Parisians prefer black people from America. Is only a certain. class of black Americans usually comes to France, educated culture, interested in France. When Janine asked the writer Cornell West about this, at a speech he gave this summer in Paris, that was his argument. Basically, he suggested this class thing and they said, well, when we look at you fashion in your art ticket, maybe if you brought 15 of your cousins, they would have a different thing. So basically, we were saying if I brought all my home girls from the hood,  who didn't all the same, we weren't boys in the hood. speak for and she always said to my dear little chillier even though they also thought about it. But I think if that's true that is not about racism and that's about class. Before I met Jenna I read the book that you have. I had what it was  from growing up. It's called Project Row and what's remarkable about it is how Frank she is that all of you can pull some things that you found us up doing. been the years when she was regularly traveling to the projects, what are the aspiring of the class? This is struggle. I'm going to first hear it, grass or ferns, she's about so out of place, she started taking the train down to New York City to score heroin, thinking every even dumb when she lived in the projects. I just got kicked out of school for that. This is the further that she traveled into the world of college, and what the project saw in her personal use, the talent to express itself somehow. She'd picked herself as somebody who was depressed and battled in the civil loss for years. And the most striking thing about meat in her, he read the book, is how completely happy she seems to be. She's one of the happiest people I've ever met, just relax and funny and at ease. And her feeling about France, country with this transformation took place, it could be sort of shocking to actual French people. We just went  the Euro 2000s, and I was , I came to work, and I was telling them rock and stuff, we're turning, we won, we just haven't gotten yay. She's , just glaring. Because she was born here and she says, I'm not French, I'm Moroccan. It's just  black Americans, I'm not American, I'm black. I was , they won me won. She's , what are you talking about? You're not even French, what do you mean we won? I'm , I'm French in my heart. And this black friend of mine was saying, you're the only person I know could sing the Malsias. That's just  how extra you are. why it's because I say to them, I never had a con. I never had a country, I had a hood, I had Brooklyn, but I never felt  I have a country. So now I have a country, it's a little one. , we always come in third of fourth place in the Olympics. That it's  France. Here's something else. There's certain things about French culture, which is, that just make  your very pleasant. What? And I think people don't ask you personal questions where you grow up, you work, which family life, what your story, you're not consuming, explaining yourself. She says she has one friend who she knew for five years before she knew this woman had a grown son. Also, there isn't the same scribe, the same ambition to be number one is in the states, especially compared with corporate odds of she used to have. Everybody was expected to put in 60 and 70 and 80 hours a week. Here, that would be seen as very strange. Or just is not that important to most people. I got to get tears in my eyes just  sometimes I look around the subway and I look at all these French people and  thank you for letting me live here in your country. We had outside. But you feel  it's your country but your identity here isn't that of a French person, it's out of an outside. I know and I think that's what it is to be Project Girl. I was always an outsider. And I feel most inside right now where I'm most outside. Go figure. That's what's read a miss though. It's not about nothing left to lose. It's about nothing left to be. You don't have to be anything. I was just thinking about it this morning. So I'm an outsider. I will always be a foreigner who met. how good my French gets. I will never really be French no matter how much of a one of the I am. And yet I feel that I'm home. I'm just home. Around the corner from the cafe for the audio game's album. Genesis, he feels  Shandu stands for the county must have felt. I'm making heart on for a family that was always struggling and then when I can hear everything is so pretty. So much easier. Here we are, this is where I am. with that painter 56 Wujakub, but see he lived way up in the top on the top floor. Rachel say one, two, three, four, fifth floor, obviously a walk up. And the cheapest apartments are always on the top, except a walk up. And that's where he was. He probably even mailed letters at that post office down there. He mailed letters back to Harlem. And you be on. Well, of course, the saddest set on for his permanent. When Janet first moved to Paris, she thought it would be just for a few years. Now, every time she goes home, she sees too much about the United States, she just does not want to do anything wrong. And she's realizing, she may never move on.
