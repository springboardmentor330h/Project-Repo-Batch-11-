  "text": ", I can think about it. The idea of April Fool's Day is just absurd. A day set aside in which we're allowed basically to admit that it's fun to deceive each other. This notion, this idea is so profoundly disturbing that we have to quarantine it into its own debt on April 1st. , April Fool's Day is for Andrews. The biggest hires. The most disturbing hires, hide people who lose their grip on what to do. and can I even tell the one? Both NWB is easy to pilot with smart and light, modern class. Today on our program, we take a full-state approaching an hour of stories about exceptions, perpetrated by from pulse of pliers, questions of these stories, and aired on NPR's morning edition years ago to get replayed here on Chicago's Public Radio Station in the April 1st. I'm contributing editor Margie Rock on 9th Tuesday. some... marginaries. I've been talking to a lot of people about liars lately. Here are two things I've known. One is that everyone has a story about some nut-neur-hast, not just a liar, but a control of life. Something to so many incredible stories about yourselves that eventually people can in the one that it's alive in the world. The other thing I noticed is how vividly people remember these stories. Maybe because something so base it was violated by the lies, some basic trust. They remember the details because they're still trying to sort it out. Here the most unbelievable eyes. You didn't have an aspect that, , that desire for me to believe it. They were  this blue, grey, but they changed color. And an aspect that said. Hi, Baru. You can never tell you he was lying by his eyes. It's I, he was so sincere. She had shark- eyes. He is a very charming person and I think a lot of people's flyers are charming. People shark-tie. I mean, I think that he believed everything he taught me, has something from it. When she laughed, her eyes didn't laugh. Her whole face would laugh and she made the sounds of laugh. But she herself didn't laugh. Sometimes  you're being lied to, but at first you don't take it that serious. You rationalize to yourself that everyone has their ex-interest in. Maybe this is a temporary condition. Maybe they're just trouble. Maybe you can help them. People kept saying to me, this guy's this, this guy's that, this guy's this, this can't you see that. And I will... So busy protecting him that I said, okay, I'll show you when good times since all Mary We went out and we were together for a couple of years before we got married and He would tell me these things and things just kept not adding up one of the instances that I can think of is that one day My ex-husband came over was crying and he said he was really upset and he told me he was not in the mood. And I gave him tea and simple date for weeks. We just didn't even, , really leave the house. whisk us... Then, he moved and with me, at least…. started getting letters from where I knew his mother lived with his mother's initials on out and when my mother had nine brothers and sisters and this is coming from my aunt and my aunt has exactly the same initials that my mother had and one day I just opened one of those and I read it is  dear son She didn't say If they are sounding right was my grave principle and it'sfereness, be sayin çristeing this is interesting yeah when-if out these letters well these letters were written to me before she died censoring she almost works whatever she has He would get these boxes from somebody back east. This is somebody who was very close to me. But then getting noticed here, I found a letter from her because you can't hide everything. And here was this woman who said that in fact, she was his wife. And , how was he doing? And she was worried about him. And when we shake, he can come see her. And then he disappeared. Then he showed up again. And she said that she had been all over the world. And that he had to get out of it. And he really wanted to clean up his act. And I knew that he was... I was so excited to be involved with him but in fact, where did he go? I wouldn't hear from him that I wouldn't hear from him. I was becoming more and more worried and more and more concerned. I felt  he had somehow been victimized and that was what was making him. Tell these lies. And he showed up with nothing and nothing. a few weeks later he got a box from the woman's name and there was some of those people out to it. And this is interesting. You tell me you're in Chicago trying to get out and mobbing. You have you walked in a room. Well, he said that this woman was  a lovely princess. What you really thought was perfect. Mary did the mob. real life and , she would go to Maine to buy clothes, her father was wealthy, somehow I don't know this story was so cocky, maybe and I thought if you're a mafia princess why would you want to buy your clothes at LLP? The one thing that I did not appeal that he lied about is that he worshipped the ground that I loved and he would say I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and whether that was why you're not that's  the kinds of why she wanted to hear. When I figured out that he had had Who knows how many other Lives complete lives what what one of the things that I realized is that he would create a person and if that person didn't work Does he would just leave that person leave that body leave that location? This is the living end move to our new place start with a new person and build a whole new life and sing This person over. Maybe people will  this person. Maybe all  this person. I wanted so much, sometimes you want so much to believe somebody. Even if  that they're a liar that You try to see So you don't ask them anything. Then the only reason to ask a question is because it becomes  a comedy routine. It's , right kind of story will I hear a point through this question. Sometimes I, when I would be in a sick mood, I would do that kind of stuff just to hear a tune that I knew. little story. When our second baby was born, he couldn't handle it and he got into drugs. And I would say to him, the only way we can work on it is for you to admit to me and not lie to me. You tell me, I have a problem. And he would say, I don't. And I'd say, you do. Good to see you. and tell me the truth over. I think that what I noticed most from the hour that he left was that I just kept sighing out of the disco. I couldn't talk to anything else. I was just so relieved. People were saying to me, well, , he's wrapped up in drugs and he's not thinking straight. Do you think that he might come and hurt you? And I thought maybe if he's taken on yet another life and he's gone through too many lives and he is going to. In fact, come and kill me and kill the kids and disappear. And that was the only time I thought suddenly all these lies, it's scary. I felt a lot of fear and I didn't sleep. I didn't sleep and I had bars but on all my windows and all my doors. It wasn't funny, it wasn't something I could deal with and it wasn't something I ever wanted to deal with again. One of the things that is very important in all of this and why I sound calm is that I really didn't love him. I wasn't in love with him. So that was my own mind. So I was lying too. I was saying, yes, I love him. Yes. I know it doesn't seem  it, but yes, I love you. It would come out of my mouth because you don't want to say to somebody, no, I don't love you, but I want to see you and so it was my own want to. In that self-deception and thinking that I can make this work, that was the biggest life of all. And the issues are there people, small eyes that they're going to turn. I'll be in my life, but I just have to constantly keep working on is not lying to myself, not deceiving myself. And it's difficult. It's really hard. Psychiatry, word-hold, is a science. And given the fact that lines of common, you'd imagine that someone had thoroughly disassembled this personality disorder. Figured out why some people's reasonable truth mechanism gets jammed between gears. So we call it these two experts to find that what they know. Psychologist Paul Eckman, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and Brian King, a psychiatrist at the UCLA School of Medicine. Dr. King has surveyed the public psychiatric material online and usually says, it's quite remarkable. There's been relatively little attention about it too. Now if you look at the world literature over the past hundred years and come up with me in the 70s, 80 cases. We've been very little searching for positive lawyers because they don't come into your office. They don't seek you, and they're not interested in cooperating with the search. There's nothing in it. And as for the scientific research that has been done, the results are pretty disturbing. For instance, studies have shown that most people cannot tell when they're being minding. That's true even people who are especially trained to detect lawyers. Then they are the case studies. It's hard to offer a great deal of hope. Anyone who's getting it means far to the campus in mind. because there's very little loose who are going to change. Some people have written that lying something that is very difficult to change. That in order to have treatment response, you have to have someone who's able to live with the truth that they're based on the ability to tolerate and explore the truth. , I would categorize myself as a liar. Even in the safe compines of the therapist's office, , you're still tempted to lie. You guys here have no idea what they're making us over that. Now one can be exactly the certain areas to fly, some people become from those. But the two motors, they're most likely our powermen, and also flyers and flies because they want to control it. So when you see this in early adolescence, please fly slowly for losing your pinch. and they can eat the whole grain. They put one of the parents. Some people, you're a girl out there. It becomes a game. And one particular store that refused to give me a cash exchange for a particular piece of merchandise I told him I was joining him here. Marines, and then it's completely said we shipped off to Saudi Arabia. That was an instance where I thought, well this would be kind of funny. Maybe there is a little bit of a charge that comes with the successful. telling the blind the rush of duping someone else particularly somewhere who is perceived to be more powerful than you want. Probably more common at this deep and pulsing blinder who's  the main job but the main job opportunities are to be really great. One day I heard him telling somebody his father is the CEO of the Ford Motor Company. They are trying to... She started telling me all these things how she had this uncle and the uncle was the president of 2017 Fox And that she worked there as a young adult We get attention, interest, we get a generation And since we might be the one who is being dipped to that type of act of marriage For some reason I seem to really seek approval People, especially women And generally people will believe what they hear. And once I get that approval, whether it be, yeah, let's go ahead. Let's have a relationship with every dream. , for just a smile. And that was enough that was my fix. Again,  an addiction to anything. Good alcohol. Can you get in? Whatever. The drive is that the next time I engage in this behavior is going to be. The one that's fulfilling. You really feel almost  you're protecting yourself. You're just losing your arm through the light. You're the virus, don't you? When you look at the histories of these people, very often they come from childhoods where they were traumatized. From situ. where you would expect a young child to develop a sense that they didn't matter, that there was something wrong with them. And some compulsive line may reflect attempts to rewrite history. If I can get this person to believe that I do have welcome Rome to some of the night, it was pampering some child and so on. Maybe I can get myself to believe it too. Take this story. Most of them. It's a bit unfolds and one of those dorm rooms, it's claustrophobicly thinking, 10 feet by 12 feet, only enough space for two identical single beds, two identical deaths, two identical dressers, one narrow window which doesn't open very hard. It's the kind of room where interior decorating means a poster-sized glow up of a New Yorker carton, and the walls they came at were green, blind green. In this room, a small college in Nebraska with two guys were just... used to a new social hierarchy. They're in a world where it's possible to live with someone. You're not that close to them. I never considered him my friend, really. He was my roommate. He'd run up in this little thing, trying to grasp. So we'll be gonna quit later. He liked me telling you that he didn't actually brought me to the hospital. Awesome. He's on this business. It was when he started talking about Boston in Cleveland, in St. Petersburg, in the story with something  this, that his father was an executive for a company that made satellites. Never told me the name of the company. Important international corporation in Boston. And they lived in Boston just down the street, found. and the Kennedy State. And as a child, he used to play with the Kennedy Children. He told me that the first time he met the news, by sneaking into the Kennedy State through the head. He found the kids in the back yard. He got to know them, and I don't really remember the names, but he wouldn't be new all the names and he would describe their personalities. His best friend in the group was one of them. Robert Kimms. Eventually, Babata-Temp used in high school. His father found out that he had a serious parking machine. He couldn't work anymore. He had to quit and not only did he have to quit, but he had to get away from this fast lane, high society, lifestyle. had decided to move the family back to the small town from the grass and the bird mountain. So that was how he explained why he was in the small town. Because when he unliked and he would often go home to the small town of this experience. He often used to tell him he would go to Boston and we can talk about his father's crime. He told me that he was being simple. I've supported private candidates that the candidates were being from the college. And I asked him the first question that I think would have hurt anybody at this moment. Well, it was Ted Kennedy was the one who was thinking in our college. If Ted Kennedy had been here to go to school, why are you being the brass? Why aren't you going to Harvard or Yale or something? He said, well, I have to stay close to my father because my father is a male and he's a male. Although I could have said something because he's not justinger,rez Meugern. send a private point to get you, ? I don't know. And yeah, I know how to do it. I basically, basically believe what at least never really thought it was worth mine while to doubt it. And it went on that way for about five months, until one Sunday night. came back, we've been away, and it was acting sort of funny, kind of sheepish, but yet grinning a lot, and as if he had a sheepish. And I sort of, you've told from his behavior that it was the kind of secret that he wanted me to ask about. It was so fine, man. It was going on, right? I don't know why you were dancing there, but it didn't end. Why didn't you guys appear looking out for him. I felt  I was pointing along really by this point had serious doubts about anything to say. So well I just swipe my father's pointing. So I mean just took it huh? Yeah I just went for a ride. There you go. It was a blast. Why did you have to do it? The blast was back again. It was such a big round. Well it was a... prize because it was roses 90 second. Birthday. I really wanted to go. I'm fond of it. Want me to? I'm fond of it. I'm fond of it. I'm fond of it. I'm fond of it. I'm fond of it. I'm fond of it. Then it was a few weeks after that. That I ran into one day. On the other hand, a woman who was a mutual friend of ours, that there wasn't a ания of anything  that. On the one hand, a bear. oh... And that safety thing of my wife. Most of the girls came from greenVENI and they came to me. But a bird. So darkness brown... but she's one of them. Well, I went home, last weekend. The small town, she was found. In public library she just happened to come across city directors for every small town in the house. In the city directors for the small town, the list. We are where you the watcher occupation. So all the information you want to know about the city. And so she pulled down the street. He was from and looked up his name, his name, his name, his name, his name, his name, his name, his father was, and electricians, his system. Not a retired, he's sick. That's the one who was from the Southern people, and more electricians, his system. And at that moment, for why, see, very sad. I sort of thought if I had confronted him, something terrible. I mean, I just thought he would have roughed down because someone were kicked a big hole in this wall, if he was trying to erect between himself and the truth. I was kind of scared. because once you learn that someone is capable of just completely deceiving you about who they are, where do you find what their families  to. Then you never knew what? Because I, , I found this out sometime before the end of the school year. So I had to live with this year. I had to sleep with this year in a small university dormitory room where my narrow symbol bed was about three feet away from his narrow single bed. And it was a man who would look at me with his eyes and his blonde with this very earnest, sort of frantically earnest looking his eyes telling me about his father's job, one important opinion am You have to consider the fact that we was only shocked. And if you ever been to a really small town, if you've been to a really small town, and you're a different kind of kid, it doesn't matter in what way you're different. But there's a good possibility that while you're growing up, you might look around you and not see anybody. You're only in with me so you can. He might have grown up from really, really, and so how do you respond? He created this fantasy where he wasn't just friends with one kid. He made it sound  we need to talk about. He goes swimming in the pool, whether it be a dozen of it. I can imagine a plain soccer on the lawn together and there was this whole little community. It definitely seemed to be a desire behind it. And I guess I could see because all the time that I was from is nowhere near a small winter. I grew up in an environment where I looked around me as a kid and just never heard the sun. Thank you for being so powerful. That time I never been lost in Eden. And I had grown, I had been part of, , I went through a real stage in the one key student or an addiction to the mind. The first biobacid I ever grabbed, but I even ran across the courage. I'm asking each of you to be pioneers towards that new frontier. all. If you're trying to embroider a life in America, what myth that you can attract to put yourself onto? Who you can pick? It seems to me  the candidates might be most people's first choice. If I were going to pick one, that's probably the one I would pick to. In a way, that's me. why I was irresponsible. I mean, if I got to picture him at the wheel of the spot, I sort of had this picture in my head of him driving the plane just, , and when you think about flying from Nebraska to Boston, that's  three hours and you DeServer общем and you just certainly imagine there's space, I'll go one I know I owe Ohio into the news and I just sort of saw him in my head doing this and then maybe the Kennedy said they were on airskirts or something. Did he go to Logan International Airport right in the middle of downtown from the street? If he landed at Logan International Airport did he just park the point there and did Ted have another movie waiting for him? No, I thought about all this news. I played with the audience. So in a way I guess I was... What else? I was having some fun with him too. He was listening to a special edition of this American life, an hour of two stories, that can cause some buyers. I hope that every American regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience and other related incidents. more lies, minute when the problem continues. This American life on that earth class mostly to course on this program which is a theme, but a variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme. This week, however, as April Fool's Day approaches, we are in a break-mall that to bring this animal on special on the wires and also fires on the earth. The fact is people won't... believe in lies. People want to believe in false liars. Now lies they tell are usually repeating. And most lies told by anyone, most of them succeed because they first believe lie to in some sense. Wants to be eaten. It's just  you want to believe in the just you don't want to be eaten to try. And you can keep believing the life forever except for this fact. They can't lie or they can't lie well enough. along, it keeps adding in my pushing things to the edge. And then that's why you do it as a liar. Maybe it loses its punch when you've repeated the same story over and over again in this universe of X-hundred. Maybe you have to embellish a little bit so that it is interesting. Probably what's more  the victims is that when your lies believed and it doesn't solve your internal pain. that you have to crank it up a notch so that maybe this time you feel better, maybe this time on, be acceptable to yourself. Maybe that's what pushes people, ever closer to the brain can ultimately to a point where their lives are from clusters. There's this thing that happens when you're involved with the two-pulse of life. You go through the space where you don't believe the things you're hearing, but you don't exactly disbelieve a leader. You're a member. You think this person's nice and the lies are kind are so big that they think that they're lying with me and acknowledging that they're kind of crazy. So instead, you don't think anything. It's  this response that some animals have a danger called Tonic Immobilization. When they're threatened and they can't get away, they just play dead. P sûr is no. You. you two. You. things tell them to stay motionless. And the problem is, once they've put themselves asleep, it's hard to wake up. I love my father, dearly. And I didn't want to believe these things about him. So I would just try to put him the back one mind and everything about him. This teenager, she stayed in that limbo phase for about a year. Her mother watched it happen. My daughter went along this thinking that her father certainly wouldn't  her though I had death. and it would told her that she had the care for the sun. Here's what happened. She had a $1,400 college scholarship and sent them to the West Point where she was enrolled, but she quit after basic training and switched to this other college in Virginia. Her parents were recently divorced and broke. She was depending on the return of this deposit at West Point. It never came over to me. I didn't know exactly when the check was coming. I didn't know when they were sending it because my dad... was receiving all my mail. He kept telling her that the chair hadn't come. My dad just kept telling me different stories. For months, when he would tell me reasons why the chef wasn't coming to me, I had trouble believing it, but I let it slide. I thought he loved me so much that he wouldn't be doing what he was doing. And I just didn't want to mock me. So I probably shouldn't have. He told me that it was sent to my old address when my mom lived before she moved, all that had to be sent back to West Point to have a new checkmate, and then it was delayed up at West Point for some reason. He told her that he had various calls with West Point and that they had said they were deducting certain mouse for year forms and out the check never came. Then another time happened or he said it was lost in the mail. never got there. And I didn't know what's we was , well, what do I say? But I really think hard about it and people, my dad's were truthful. This and that were just at that time I didn't think about that. It didn't want to. My mom told me stories about what my father had done to her. I lived with this name for 19 years. And I and you did a lot. If you told me the sun was shining on the hat, it got to that point. When my mom told me the situation about what my father had done, I had trouble believing what she was saying. I would agree with her, but deep inside, I didn't know exactly how to feel. Because I was split in between them a lot after the separation occurred. I was the person in the middle. And I had to go in between the two. And I didn't know what to believe what I was hearing. I just tried to blow off anything I heard, so that it is one effect. Finally, he said, a check is calm, and I have taken it to my attorney's office for say, keeping his there. That's in our neighborhood and I've been listening to this check. So he had it locked up in the ward which said, and I thought, well, I guess that's understandable. However, this comes. stupid, but I didn't want to not believe him with it. Many told me that the lawyer had to be called back into the military because of the operation of storm. He had to go back into the reserves. He said that he was the only one who could open the same. I thought that was pretty stupid too because... What if he died? Who would be able to get to the safe then? There had to be someone who could open the safe. There was his partner or his secretary or someone could get it to the safe. So I finally got two suspicious and thought it was a very stupid thing he was saying to me. And then finally I said, look, you really need to call me attorney's office. And I called the lawyers office. He's gone up that man didn't even know about he was actually at home. had nothing sent away. When he got on the phone, I was just , what? I could not believe it. I was in shock. I mean, I always had trouble talking to him because I didn't expect him to be there in the first place. And I'd ask him about the check and he said, he had never heard anything about it and he hadn't seen my dad in a long time. It was just a load. This was put on my shoulder and I just couldn't believe it. My whole body just went and went. So that evening I called my dad and I was crying on the phone and I asked him, what he had done with it? And he said that he had lost the check in the mail. Yeah. I just didn't believe him. Finally, that's the point where I just wasn't doing what he was saying. She called me and she said, she said, you were going to, , she's crying. That's what that was just happened. I need to do one. That's what my younger daughter said. , this is worse for us than it even was for you, mom, because you got away and you were always in my heart. And a man for me, who lies  this, is not in control. I don't see. and that's the hardest part. I can't. I was daddy's little girl and everybody knew it and I loved him more than anything in the whole world. Every once in a while I think that this could not have happened there. Can't be real and I don't want to think about it in it. admit that it happened and sometimes I try to put my mind on other things and try not to think about it but it's always there and it's always digging at me. She's hurts and heart is hurts in your heart and the part of my heart was taken out when he did this to me. It's really hard to explain but it just feels that part of me is missing. Not a once. I don't trust my father anymore. I've never know why he did it. I don't think so, ever admit it to me. Why? She was Danny's girl. She is the one. When the big light comes down, it makes you question the fabric of all of your experiences. You don't believe anybody. You don't believe anything. And the lies act  a weird kind of anti-matter on all of your memories. You don't know what to do. think about the past. It shakes up your view of the world to save place. So to restore some kind of order, you launch this private investigation, you make telephone calls, you look for clues and old letters. Then you combine the evidence with your own memories and start sorting everything into two different files. There's a pile of real things and a pile of things that were totally invented. You think that if you can make this classification system work, then you can just throw out the pile of fake stuff, that's something which is not up the street, but if you can even find out what it is that's truck reality and go on with him. The problem is it can't be done. There's all these tiny pieces of data which don't make sense, but are too important to the scar. So, as a matter of convenience, you start the third pile and you call it don't know. So now there's true, false, and don't know. And unfortunately, the don't know pile. It's where almost everything ends up. The best thing you could have in a meet, a thing that would allow me to go to my grave, probably more stable eyes of the people who said, no, this is the same thing. is what the truth is really. This is what was true, and this is what was it. Sometimes you can spend years sorting out the truth. This woman runs a dance company. She had a fiance. He seemed to have a lot of money. They lived in an expensive apartment and he bought her a car. They were together for three years. And then, weird things started happening. , she said a courbant called me to say, why not I was going to make a payment? And I said, you got to be out of your minds. I hate you guys. You have investment in South Africa, you screwed over a bank account in mind a long time ago. I wouldn't have a city court. Well, you have three city court accounts. And they're  $10,000 over me. So I call him up and he's , I can explain it. I'm , good. He's  sending me the information. I mean, if he has his way. talking to me that will calm me down and make it seem  everything you ever wanted could come true. And he also had this demeanor that I'll take care of everything. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. And I would believe that he would take care of it. Say I figured out later how he did all of this stuff and how easy it is for anyone to do. once a week you get something in the mail it's easy, have you? or a gold card or whatever. Well, most people just  pitch those in the garbage. Well, he didn't. He sold them all out. And since we filled out one credit card together, he knew  all my information. There are cases if you're next to our name, and you're going to be right now, and you don't know. There was three city bank cards. , they were starting. What is this? possession earned my car there was $8,000 on that there was a gold card that had a $5,000 credit limit and it was run up beyond its credit limit. I'll told I owed  $65,000 to $75,000 and I was making $26,000. I found out about all of this all in  $40. As I found out that he had been seeing someone else, we had had. had this really to multitang, we called him up and told him how I did not know what was wrong. And I mean, he was , , a martial basket case. It turned out he'd been dating someone in New York and she dumped him. And he called me for a simple thing. And he couldn't really tell me why he was so distraught. It's , all in that, I asked him about it. And the whole story comes out. If you can see him, this other woman who was madly in love with her, she had dumped me. and had just gone to  Australia to marry someone else. And I'm , on the one hand, I'm being , what did friends? Well, I didn't feel about this. , it's only, and then I'm , why are you crazy? I mean, I felt literally  someone had ripped my inner out my whole world was exploding, which is why I went back. and I did eight years too. Everything that air was so heavy. It was too much work to get to the palm. It was too much work to put food in my mouth. It was too much work to get up. Put my clothes on. You've got to be honest. And my friends didn't even have to be better. You didn't even see me. Which is always a good way to jump start. Shh. Unfortunately, I'm one of these people who need to be needed. Even though I hate that role that I've prepared for myself. It's a real, , your cat. I can't just  save me from it. potential suicide points. , Aero needs to be fed something to cool the litter box. It's so easy to be taken through. No, it's this fantasy that they create that you want to be in. I mean, part of it, I'm madly I'm out with this guy. And you said, you're an artist. You should be doing artwork. You shouldn't be dealing with finances. I'll support you. I'll take over all the finances and it's  guys dropped out of the sky He worked hard. You deserve this. You are Money has always been a really stressful thing for me my family didn't have a lot of money You have to understand my history. I was the oldest child in my dad died. I was 13 my mother Didn't know how to deal with it. I had three kids under me. I became the second adult in the family when I was 13 years old. I started drinking coffee, I started going to a parent teacher meetings, , I was always mothered to everyone else. And I was , , the head dancer in a company and then I had my own company. And here was someone who came along and said, I'll take some of that way. I'll take care of you. And I've been one of these people who always had to do that for everyone else. So  a deepest, darkest secret desire is that someone somewhere will do that for you. The thing about him is he was probably really, really into it because I think perhaps what he's able to do is become a mirror of your secret fantasy life, of your secret desires. And I don't know because I'd  to be a fly on the wall and see if he does that. With other people whether the fantasies are always different or whether he's so ingrained. See, there's two things. Either he's this kind of person who's so intuitive that he can create a fantasy. That mirrors whatever your fantasy life is. Or he picks up people who will buy his fantasies by. And I don't know which one it is. He had this entire fiction of his life. I believe it. Some of it was. I'm sure some of it was true because I don't think he would have ended up the way that he ended up. It's some of the stories that he told we're not true. And it mean when you tell these stories it was passionate. It was  the best theater you've ever attended. It was the best monologue. He was from Ireland. He was an early, a lawyer. I can never figure out what those people are. His fans father had been very prominent in politics. He had been given a different last. name  he had been given the last name of the ancestral family because his father had singled them out as being known to chosen the son or whatever and then his father told him this treated him and abused him emotionally and the IRA blew up their home at some point  it was  this tragic existence this really compelling tale of a person kind of move drifting  looking for something they can hang on to. I think I was a director, director of commercial for one of the big advertising agencies. And then when the swipe died, , maybe brilliant commercials. And then sold everything he owned and went down in the UK, mercenary fighter and board of the speech down in South America. , maybe he did that. Maybe he did. The problem that I still have is I don't know which were lies. I don't know what's real and what's not I mean I've shat thought it will back in the truth, but I went to Ireland. I went to the place where his house supposedly would be and there is a house that's Underwent significant damage now. I mean if I really cared to make a life project out of this I could research every aspect of what we call Oh he didn't completely disappear though. He's still , we'll call him in. I'll be  cooking dinner at my house, my phone number's not listed. I've moved twice since he knew me. And we'll call him. How are you? And I'll be , fine. People have said, do you think he really loved you? Or are people at home you never really loved you? I used my most key among that school of people. And this is part of what masses with my head still, because I don't believe that I could be so far off the mark. I mean, I believe that he truly loved me. And he looked into my eyes and said, I love you. When he calls me back and says, there's no need for him at this point. Now, if he really is trying to make this pun go down, he wouldn't try to keep him panterically. He keeps coming back and I believe it's because he really did love me. I think for a while afterwards I  to create an illusion. He's a bad dream and I'm going to wake up and he's going to come back and he will have gotten his fabulous job, he's going to pay off all the staff. And I'm not going to have to do this. Anyway. I'm a little bit nervous. But he kept saying, I'll take care of you. I feel I swear I won't be wrong. I won't make this up to you. I really think he believed. I think he had no basis in the hell. General. I'm just... And I really wanted to believe. I really wanted to believe he wasn't as horrible over the years. And I'm just... I'm just , I don't know. I'm not vindictive, am I? Sometimes I  to kill them. Mostly I just  to have... I  to have the dream back. And ... I knew wish that there had been someone out there existing in the world who was who to said what? That would be great. I think that's extremely, truly lovely. and probably didn't want things to turn out the way they did, but he was so deeply entrenched in that, and couldn't say, okay, erase everything I've ever said to you, and believe this is the real story, this is who I really are. And they very well thought this is going to be the one that I'm going to say, , really  children. You talked to, ,  long-range commitment kinds of things. Because the house of cards didn't fall down to what, at least it would be up. So, bills were being paid. That's some of them were being, , always wanted to catch up games. So, maybe he thought, and then I'm just gonna get it one more credit card and pay to start keeping the clothes. I'm gonna get this job, I'm gonna get it eight thousand dollars in your, I'm not gonna have to worry about it. And just next credit card, oh, I'll get one more. And I'll get one more, I'll keep those off, just to keep it going, just to be going. So, the longest time, even after I said, and look at what you've done, you're done to me. You said, I... I will make it up to my will pay every son fat. See, I think maybe he just sold me off. Maybe he's the best actor in the whole world. Academy Award winner. The names are just creates this character. It's just , no. It's  standing on a chair. It's  nothing's gonna happen. Nothing's gonna happen. It's  a whole crisis of faith. What do you believe? I don't know what it is. You believe, I'm so sick. You are all being able to do something you need in these words. You believe? What do you believe? Once I interviewed a pure psychologist and this is what he told me about girls. The past is girls. To kind of do the most haunting are the ones who left this world so abrupt when they only the mother they did. He said it's  two people, driving in a car, getting into this horrible car with a driver's name. But the passenger is catapulted to the front windshield and dies. The parasite called to set the soul of the passenger to the rip from the body so quickly that their energy remains. This vector is confused, everything happens so suddenly, and that's quite keeps bothering the rest left behind. Once you discover that everything someone has been telling you about himself is basically nonsense. It's  he's suddenly find yourself alone in that car. The person who is sitting next to you no longer exists. All its left is his favorite memory. And figuring out what to think about the experience and of taking people's years. Your stuff for a while between several conscious victory being this stuff in life, being elder, stupid thing. You don't know what to think. You wait until you just don't care about it. And if people  you often, they say they be the world different. Now, I don't trust them. My husband says you are the most suspicious one than I should have for a encounter. It's  I go through his mail ever since then everyone every time I meet some Restrikes and dishonest there's this moment where you see or wonder What did they do? She's where the reason why I live in this apartment alone because I would never ever move into somewhere I didn't know any people that you do know they don't turn out to be  that Our program was composed of Irish, which was produced by Marky Rock on myself, narrated by Marky Rock on post production by Peter Kong.
