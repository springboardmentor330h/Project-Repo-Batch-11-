It's not allowed there, brothers. How are you doing? Time and started on my tiny mid-name. Scott is the shoveled and tired, working all night, it's Barton, Chinese restaurant. Fitting lots of three drinks on the side, Tom. And Tom, the spot seems astonishingly of grateful. Here is the kind of sass that Tom keeps throwing, that's when you... what I needed food, beers, all that stuff on that compound, remember, the traumatic night stealing from your blurrier. No. Just to that moment, man on a Hawaiian print shirt and tacky pants walks by their table. He hears the word, all year. It stinks for the word, all year. And that times the time. So you're a lawyer? No. No. You want to be? You brought up the lawyer to start with you just wanting to. Help me off. No one knew it. Not at all. He didn't say, Lord. He thought that he heard something and he let the mind hear go for the naturality. Which he orders. That's probably why I might have thought that. what? I'm trained in the part of listening and... ...sporting, saying, you wanted to be a boy. You wouldn't hire you because you heard clearly wrong. I mean, yeah. There's some conversations that you have to hear. It is hard not to want people to listen, for it to bud in, even though everybody knows that it is not the right thing to do. What's in the morning, while back, sitting on the beach is very dining. Go to App, and start out, and meet an app. And go to the restaurant. The table next to me, the family was taking their teenage daughter out, not with last breakfast, which she shipped out with home to. So we dressed up people who come in from the church across the street, young couples who were working on the crossroads. together. And I thought, only somebody could interview every person, every table in this restaurant. That would be amazing to get such a wide variety of different kinds of different kinds of people. So, we'd said try. What Friday night? Big group of us, to Chips, starting at 5 a.m. going to 5 a.m. the next morning. Going quiet hours, just one of some recording and interviewing. We're in the busiest hour. Please write down your full-time story. First broadcast is program all the way back in 2000. And you're going to be going to begin today. Would I be easy Chicago today show? 24 hours at the Golden Apple. This is American Life. I'm Howard Glass. I'm speaking. It's five o'clock in the morning. My name is Pete. I work from now again. PM who are 5 AM and now we will have the text drivers in the cups, , come for cup of coffee until 6 o'clock the morning crowd will be in. He eats one of the three owners in this restaurant, along with Nick and Tom. After he agreed, one of them is always there, 24 hours a day. The restaurant sits one of those inner sections, three streets together, too. So, every one of the corners in the inner section is way too. He's the restaurant. with boots, on windows, on two sides of the wedge. There's a counter in the schools, on a larger room with tables in the back. There's oversized, laminated menus, the clock pages, paint pictures of the food. By the door is one of the revolving dessert cases. Not done, glass, three shelves, green pots, melons  this. Okay, exactly. The nothing to trouble. Here's Nick, another one. Supposedly turning, it's not turning, because the motor broke. I'm not sure if you're going to be supposed to come out  three days ago. Just don't come. I'm thinking of the relationship. But the pie tastes not turning, believe it or not, it's not something that's what's which is. desserts sales are down, he says. I tap. Ever since rough. People just  dessert more in their emotion. It catches the arm. , when it's turning, it catches the eye and it sucks. so everything. of 20-hour hours, staff the Golden Apple changes regularly spring change and the atmosphere changes. Quiet, now in morning, crazy hecked it, they did not, and fires the neighbor and the button. Nancy update, first shift, that's 24 hours surveillance, Mike and Ham, 5 am, total 10 years. This is Eddie, who comes to the Golden Apple a few times a week, in morning, so please to harmonicate middle of the restaurant. He's in a pale blue shirt and hopping  he's flipped but I might fall down. Eddie heads to the back of the rest of the day. No one is complaining, no one is rolling their eyes. Back a few people are smiling, saying hi. Eddie is not an outside, he's a regular. Early morning at Golden Apple is  that. Family Democrats, was early morning welcomes the night. ship workers, yet employed, retired, confused, disappointed, slightly off. The people who work for themselves and the people who don't work at all and they want to crave a little morning routine. Every morning I'm here between 4.30 and 5. I love the goal and that goal. They're wonderful people. They got good food. And that's it. This is how Joe Molyaca ends every Saturday. Or send. That's all I could tell you. Joe's not used to talking about himself. The story comes out bit by bit. Our entire conversation takes place in a different era. He's completely unsolved conscious about calling you, and bans unscathed up the spoon to get the way to see the tent for a week. Please don't try this at all. But he gets away with it. I do construction. Removige rehab. And that's what I do. We fired them. 78 years old. I gave the business to my two sons. And that's it. How did you start that business? Through my dad. My dad done the same thing when I was, I don't know, maybe. Ten or eleven years old, I started working for him who would pay me a dime an hour. And that was it. Clean up, sweep up the floors that he's working on. What else do we know? at 530 in the morning almost everyone is sitting alone, by choice and seats, Joe's friend Bob is sitting in his own booth behind Joe. No one's talking much, but it's a comfortable size. When you're up this early it's hard not to feel some sense of community with everyone else who's away. But you don't necessarily want to talk to them. As it gets lighter and lighter outside, more people should be bored. A guy with thick dark blonde hair and a face that looks it could use another... six hours seats, sits down at the counter. His name is Scott Johnson and he says he usually comes in around 3.30 a.m. but today's different. It's about 20 a.m. to 7. How did you start coming in, Colton? I own a bar with officers called Witz and then another one on Tom's, Clark and Oakdale called Jakes. How did you get into the bar, then? For what? Well, about eight years ago, I turned 30, with my career in kind of divorce and by the bar. It's the edge sketch, it's sugar. It seems to love that I don't sugar you're hiding. See, he's my wife for it. It's completely light outside now. The computer traffic is picking up. The golden apple isn't crowded, but all the front foods are taken. Most of the counter. Nick keeps getting deliveries. orange juice, potatoes, and his butcher comes by John service. John is a big man in that way that's the Norwich Pago. Not fat, just big. John has been eating at the Golden Apple and spying its meats ten years. When he was eight years old, he became famous for being the youngest butcher with Illinois. Back in 1979, I was interviewed by Fati Flint. I don't know if you remember back in 1979, Fati Flint was a well-known amusement right gauge in 1977. was before he died day one. I was a game with Burchas and we were going to in 1987 and yeah  I've got the governor top stop ran off so he was my father was criminal business so I ran off screen and this high-cern learning kind of cut. So I've been doing this for I'm 33 now and anybody since I was  eight years old. You were a butcher when you were eight? Well yeah I've been in Bob  seemy today wasn't about four years old I started at the middle of the van song. Do you remember the first piece of meat you had for us? Just for a point nice. I remember very well  it was yesterday. Real Slot in Manston, 4x. 4x  you can keep off. I used nice first thing I did is cut it off in middle and start from the middle. The trick is, it's 10. Not to cut your hands when it comes really small. You got to use a special kind of thing that's underneath the band saw. That's a picture. And knit because the band saw doesn't have any friends. I mean if this is going to grab your hands and cut it. The part of the Golden Apple is the smoking session. Sitting there is a grayish woman of a fleshy face, wavy hair, one of the small two-person boots. Her name is Alice D'Ukka. Hi, we're at a Pierce Station Center. It's a sign of running vitamins and minerals to prevent your baddies, chats and smuddies. Wow! Do you have any problem yourself? Yes, I'm here. After the naked eye, it looks  you're smoking. You're drinking coffee and about to have some sausage. So how does that square with the whole toxin? Well, you're trying to wake up. He's toxins to wake up. I guess so. The restaurant never gets crowded this morning. Turn over as slow. People winger over their coffee or their conversation. So we eat days so there's no impatient French crowd waiting for tables to wake up. And if you don't have an office you need to go to. Why rush? Don't have a waitress. It's finishing up the night shift. Getting ready to go home. She's been on since 11pm. Never know it. We'll look at her. She's... six feet tall and let's  happen and do this. She's one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen first. How long have you been working at? Six years. How old are you when you started? When you think I'm going to tell you this? You kidding? it's going to know how I was. Donna says she's actually not a night person, but she's worked the night shift the entire time all 26 years. She can't just come. from Oklahoma City in her early 20s with three kids. I was just divorced in my team and I had married so young, I met her in my no education. I had my baby that's why I started working nights. But this is a great job for them. I mean working nights that way you're working here in the day, you don't sleep much but when they're sleeping here work and I'm still working the night, I don't know why I've done that soon. Every Christmas Eve, Donna brings in a big tray of homemade cookies, almost guys, the old net, tax drivers, anyone who shows up that night. Everyone's so well on her afternoon off, she'll go see a play starring one of the actors who come in every night after their own shift with. The customers' deeper tapes, the dancers, bringing their art warm courtesy, tell her about their successes, failures. These are people she's known for years. Psycholm here too. me. And I think about going on a day job, I just can't. Some of the psyched me and I was separated. It was , oh, we've been here to see. Donna runs her ship at the Golden Apple, a lot of some passion, generosity. But  any good waitress, she's also a week-lessed practical. She can be direct, and she needs to. Early morning, there's no time to stand up, Sarah. I think I got a good day to my rest now. right? Are you doing anything to set up or going up to see what I get to see? We're around and you tell me what you're doing. I'll have to say something. I don't know. I just want to be real. I don't want to be real. In the middle of the day, muted light streamed through the window for a pal-haze cigarette smoke. Certain hours because  everybody is smoking, go to the apple. Three industrial smokeeeders, non-stop. Come on, some customers come in quickly, head back work at just half hour, but they're in an hour. Probably three course customers are rigged, and even stayed for hours. Nick the owner says some come two and three times day, you they go on the sleep, they stay. We got the challenge right now in the rest of the country. And there comes twice the flight. It's right. It means, it's much with the sun. Not very good man. It's the harbour that Stephen will come twice a day. Yeah. Rush comes up three foot on to me. Out three foot on to me. The counter man who looks a little bit  the actor, Perry Dean Stan, Scott Dean, we see up in the second time. He gives me what he says, this is Nickname. Robert? It says he usually just comes from coffee, can't afford my child. So what do you come? It's something to do. What are we talking about? It's time of a head post on single, no life, no girl from the left. No kid's single. Robert is one of three different men. Tammy the- they come here and they have to know to drink coffee, talk to the waitresses. After we actually see a little shy and intimidated by the waitresses. Probably so bashful, he has a hard time saying much of anything. I'm never said more than low, low, low, low, low, low, low. Yeah, I don't know what to do when I get what's going to be good. What to say? I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. People in the back, Manuel Hernandez, the second time today, is the retired carpenter, came to Chicago, in Mexico, 1965, the one that we built the series tower, John. And how I've spoken to the world, Quiddices, they got the 100th word. He was the one day after two guys, they found down, and then went, I don't want to be next. They have to do passes, because everyone with us sharing and asking for help. getting dark, got milk and insurance coming. So where did some kind of scan? She reads it, doesn't know, they said in chat, too. She reads it, it's kind of  having all of her own. Some of these guys, who else did they have to turn? Had on the sidewalk when the weather school, restaurants at the tables, at one, house and muskere, and two kids are eating. Ian is four, Matt on his two. Both are wearing their bicycle on the table. Eating Mickey Mouse Pancakes. Three pancakes, ranged in button. you as top right law two years in a head Marish,  cherries and pineapple with famous guys in them favorite with maple syrup you have sugar concoction so powerful for your old Ian literally and not sit in his chair Ian Ian around here please thank you I don't look far from here and I do not think there's a four-year-old named ten block radius who does not know I think he wants to hear ξ You Turn around now, Ian. Turn around, please. Ah! Good friend has coyser kids in the corner inside. For a couple of their mic, it is corrosive. They cover so often. For a seven year old. They sell it home. But they constructed it. It's been very relaxed. It's been a fine replacement. They'll not bring them home. Bring them to the floor and have them. The Z-Link box takes a while for the dinner pad to show up. Bring them to the floor. To slow down in the sense. But it's Friday, a couple of start to arrive. Someone dates, some just friends, some of that vague territory in between. The pop at the conversation, start to make it orbital ship, throw a couple of suits and pop at us. One of our producers, Susan Burton, notices one pop at the station. A man and a woman in her 30s sit down and be with Iwinda. The man's long hair is tied back with Van Danna. And then a little mirror. So, again, I just got through playing who's set to tennis in Grand Park. and stopped at healing earth for a little incense and some good karma and we decided to stop the grave of light. , Sylvia and I have this kind of weird history. She actually dumped me not too long ago and that's right. She's now happily in a relationship and I was telling her as we were driving care about How lonely I am. Actually, it's been three years since Daniels of your profile. They met when they worked together at the same nonprofit organization. So you're ready to settle down now? What a problem. I'm proud of you. I actually, when you first told me that I actually wasn't sure. But they told me that I did. I did tell you that I won't be participating there. You'll have my best voices. Well friends, I still love you. I'm terrified you why can't you be there? Well, look at well,  it. It would just be weird. I mean you and I have a pretty significant history together. But I was still happy for you and you'd have mine. My best wish is and I'll still buy you a toast. It's a toast. See, I think that's a news. I would be very happy for you. When I have some feelings there. Yeah, I mean there would be a little twinge thinking why wasn't it me? It's actually a sex in the city topic a lot. It's absolutely. In case you've missed it, sex in the city is a TV show on HBO. Each episode circles around some central question, , can you be friends with your ex? It didn't also be an eye with suddenly casting our own episode show. This would be the moment where I would light a cigarette and slip open my power book and ponder what I'd seen. Then I'll see you again by talking. about so if he has a new boyfriend. But wound up discussing each other. And I started to wonder, when you talk about your ex's new relationships, and you really just talked about the two of you, I didn't tell you the sueski how my love was a little bit earlier. I did meet somebody about a week ago, her name is Amy, and she works at her, where does she work, shorts soup cuts. And she was with her boyfriend, actually. She said to me, I want to go out with you. I said fine, let's go out. She says, well, You have to wait a month because I'm still going out with this idiot over here. I mean, and she's talking about So nothing happened How would the woman be a great and boyfriend? Wait for the cheat the guy and it's she's possibly dating that way Mary, I'm not gonna marry this girl, , I mean , I mean, I I wasn't interested in in a lifetime to put it at that moment I mean, I was , much more look. and further immediate gratification. That's what your own slithas want. True, that's not a true slitha. Each time Daniel brings up someone he's interested in, Sylvia gets exasperated with him for refusing to make a commitment. It happens when he mentions the woman who's on a lounge chair by the Wilhelmoss Vegas, and the girl who's taken on a dozen dates, but is pretty sure he wants to break up with. It turns out that this is a conversation they've had before, at the end of their own relationship. I would... He was ready for the next step and he was ready to back out. Anytime I press forward, he would backwards up. Here right. You and I were in a place where you were frustrated because I could move forward. I was frustrated because you were pressing so hard and... Right? And moved in with her after three weeks. I think it's a hard topic, more a spell. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's just the thought of, , it's , go. He trails off, staring out the window. I don't know. It's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to, it's not one too big, it's go bad. Outside on the sidewalk, two girls who've gone here and short skirts at Roach. They catch Daniel's eye. Remember? As a girl striped by the window, he turns his head and follows him from one under the glass to the other. The gesture seems to happen in slow motion. that I'm telling you, but I know we're going to think that I'm just saying that we're together and you did that at really fun. Even though it's just looking. It says you're not interested in what's going on right here and that's exactly what you did You're putting even formulate the sentence because your eyeballs were glued to that. No window! This is another topic. This is been another topic on sex and sex. Just for the record, would actually happen in that episode. Woman got so mad at Boyfriend, that she punched him in the face. And then she realized she couldn't change. Everybody rest on the windows took out on Santa Francis's taping church, huge building, sits take-bring, then go to a friend's estate team, 75 years old dressed in a nice outfit and not just stock. He's here because he's one of the longtime neighbors, another golden ep, a slay that dead in the funeral hall right across the street, chelede and hair was spent. He tells me that he's lived for whole life and walking his business this very spot. I was born and raised up. late with 75 years of medicine or cancer school. So this is my neighborhood. The long thing. And it gives me a lot of pleasure to walk the neighborhood and say Margaret Cunz lived in that house. Lucille such a lived in that house. I can still see all of things in my mind as I did in the 30s and 40s. Back then for instance, Armacy was on the spot. K interference coming after 11 caught man. I'm talking about first year's second year high school when you didn't go to the Kini near City Mar at 9 o'clock in the morning. This was  a hangout year. After BS, in this whole section here, they had a wonderful soul of 12 people. Because right here, this would be... See what I'm saying? She points at a section page. Piers, this name... who was all about which parish went on to. Sienna, Francis of the Germans, Sinandus for the Irish and Italian, Sinjo's brothers and Polish. So finally, in the 1960s, that ended. Case five sisters and parents, I'm into waiting. I'm the only one that's saving neighborhood because we've come to part to move out here. We brought our house in the 1960s, 60-4, and everybody thought the neighborhood was in change. So of course, they're moving to the suburbs of farther north or farther north. last chance in these people that it was the white. We thought this was going to come down. That's why people were scared and moved out. So we couldn't afford to move. So we brought a house there for 27,000. I get off there's a 500, 450,000 from my house. Meema, whatever sisters who moved away to avoid, the military had to expens it. Air has been to afford to stop. in the waterhouse from over 200,000. Identification which spread through this name in the last 15 years has made it after the world's sister's name. We're around here, Southport and Clark, all over their little boutiques, several Starbucks, expensive restaurants, make your opinion names. The neighborhood has changed a lot here. , a whole lot. Some for the better, some for the worse. All spied. We have our gate people. . we never had kids. They were around maybe but we didn't know who they were today, you know who they are. My husband come from the old school. We have the nicest neighbors we've ever had to gay men. They can't do enough for you. Patrick Rass for you they've was now that I've older. You want to do it in my husband? I'm coming from way back, oh my god, you didn't want really much to do with them. Within a year I'd say we saw the day we're nice people, very clean, and when we had our 50th wedding anniversary party, I'm so glad you're here. We were so neighbors, we didn't have any, we didn't have any, we didn't have any. take a penny, they decorated their place  we wouldn't believe. Now, I mean, neighbors were doing wrong, but , so gay or not gay, they are really nice people. So I think that the gays can be credited for being such a nice people. They sway a lot in a whole time people into different things. There's so a lot of... If you had a black neighbor here or one of the people would rent to a black person, I think that would be proud of that. But if you rent to a gay person today, it's okay. A lot of things that we think should be this way in that way as you grow up. It's really not that way. We shouldn't be that way. So I don't feel that we should really judge you. ? Let the large jet. Coming up, Drunks, partyers, people on the make, lots of other people are right, not just judge. I mean we have not even gotten to the cops. In a minute, stack up a little bit of a video. Warm up the coffee for you? We know a person. This is American life, my request, today on our program, 24 hours of God and nothing. If you're just turning in, we try to interview every person, every table, 24 hour restaurant, and it's starting at 5am, morning on Friday, July 14th, going to 5am, the next morning.

Stem ahead the midnight, one of the owners he explaining some sort of surprising bad arrest circumstances, so I reported when we go out. Never close, we have no kids, we have no kids, you should have gone with all acts, all is often never, never  that. Just to that moment, a young woman burst into the door, I think, she's looking around because some tries to lock it, keeping her friends out. It is the second book which he realizes, there are no acts, three stomachs. Okay, this is Kim. I'm at the Goldman Abel and I'm with us. I'm about to ask who it is.

A future. So, the time is the earthly time. It's 115 AM and there is no time for my future self. how you, when you go to sleep and you dream, how you can... bend and shape the events that take place in the laundry.
