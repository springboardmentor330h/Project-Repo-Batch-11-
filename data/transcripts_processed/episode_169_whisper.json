  "text": "Hello, this is American Life, it's my class. Each week on our program of course we choose theme, bringing you a bunch of different stories on it. And the best way to describe the theme of today's show is to kind of side step in front of it and end with the screen. One of our producers here at the radio show, we'll show you something. We're living in New York for years ago with one that you describe is a kind of random movement. I'm inspiring you. In the middle of the night one night, yeah, the phone rang. And it was some crank collar, sort of, stalkery kind of person. He started saying these people things to her and it wasn't just a crank call because they knew her name. We were meant hangs up and he calls back and then she tells them off. He calls back again. And then she stops thinking, but it keeps ringing. And it's not exactly clear what to do. It'll live in life. So they call them. Blue turns to us. So the police come. become up to our apartment, we're on the sixth floor of a walk up, they come up coughing, puffing up the stairs, and it's the middle of the night, our apartment is a mess, it's just kind of strange having these strangers come into your house, it's just just cinematic and just orienting, I mean they're in their copy and forms with these guns. And one of them, this is kind of  40 something heavy, balding, Italiany looking, supports kind of guy, it looks  the tech supports from NYPD. pretty much exactly. And then the other guy is the see-on-gur, really good looking black guy. And they both just look  they're off a TV show about the cops. They're sorry I see answer I was happening. And my roommate just goes into this whole look-all-geness whole thing about how she's an actress and people calling her and we've got her headshot. Picture- Eltern daine. I was in a bit along the place, so it's scary. And then the young black cop says to her, oh, , I've had that experience because I'm an actor too. Because then I don't do it much anymore, but , I was really a serious bad at part. You can cop. They start talking about, , what it's  because they're both black and young, , playing parts in plays and, and not just anything. Whether on that, many parts that are interesting for black people. And it turns out that my roommate has played. the part of Juliette in a production of Romeo and Juliette, in which he was the only black person in play, and that he's played the part of Romeo in a production of Romeo and Juliette, who was only black person in the play. So they have this in common, they're talking about playing Shakespeare. And yeah, they're just having this whole kind of very insider, actory conversation about this. It just kind of out of nowhere. When you really looking at him, you would've just thought, cop. Meanwhile, the phone rings have some fun in this conversation. And so they say pick up, , and so when we make picks up the phone and the same guy. And the cop that looks  Detective Sipowitz is just sharing her hurt or hurt to give him the pump. So she has him the phone. And he gets on the phone and he says, , this is the NYPD. Don't call here anymore. If you keep calling here, we're going to trace the call and get you or, , somehow in case they can catch him. And the guy hangs up the phone. And there's no my phone calls, that is all. Yeah, ever. So after that, basically their job is done, but they still, they're just kind of hanging around talking for a few hours about this acting. And then the civilists cop guy says to, to my remains is, , if you're an actress, you should send your headshots to my sister because she's a filmmaker. Yeah, she's, she's. small infant filmmaker. And I'm , oh, who is she? She's usually, he's , oh, I don't know, it's a word of part of her. She just makes infant films. We're , what we , he says Nancy Savoka, who's this, , pretty famous little infant filmmaker, ladies. She made these movies that I had seen and that my roommate has seen. , some of you true love, that's great. And this movie, household scenes with a retailer. , she's just a really cool, , woman filmmaker. And , I look over at his bad and it says detective Savoka. , so, this is the story. It was the story. It was this  in the scene woman. And he's sick with, . He's just funny and he's talking about that. And then the younger cop, Chimes in, and says, well, , you're just just not the only one. Who, , is creative for the family. And the sip with Skye gets all kind of sheepish and chimes  up. And we're  what? And the on-cops is, , detectives of the boat over here, , officer's of the boat. He just sent in his demo tape to Carol King. And we're  Carol King, and I'm , as in actually the Earth move under what he, ? And he's , yeah, yeah, , Carol King. And we're all , what, ? And I was , you're demo tape demo of what? And he was , well, I'm, , I'm a singer songwriter. So, tapes tape likes it. And why did you send it to Carol K? And he says, well, , because I really  her song. Is , where are our styles or somewhat similar? And I just wanted this thing very clear. You are. It's  1990's at somebody's style. Anybody's style is still  her alluring. Plus it's this guy, the most, , sip-wits-looking guy you ever saw in your life. And it was just, I was one of this. thing it was  pulling inspiring to me because it made me feel  just  as I suspected as I hoped it seemed that everybody was up to something extra on the side had a secret talent for passion or interest the secret things they love to do one of the things about the founding of the United States America is a phrase down from the declaration of independence, phrase about life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. Resude of happiness. What exactly does it mean to grow up in country? We have an inaliable right to pursue your own happiness. Thomas Jefferson and the other founding fathers really mean it's okay to fill our hours making demos, sending them out to Carol King. If you ask a historian who studies this sort of thing, if you ask this for a new question, it comes quick very quickly that this is not their favorite question. That seems to be the big question. everyone asked them and there is no simple answer. Pulling mayor is an expert on the Declaration of Independence. She's written a book on the Declaration of Independence. It says, oh, anyone ever remembers or wants to talk to her about when it comes to the Declaration of Independence is this one phrase, the pursuit of happiness. As a people, the American's tend to ignore everything else about this document. Instead, they puzzle over what does this right mean if you have a right to trial by jury. That's pretty easy to define but pursuit of happiness. Happy Shoes. same somehow much more ambiguous and and I suppose it is because it is less concrete it contains a promise and almost  the kind of promise that you hear contained in  the rock of all song and here's one of the founding documents of the country which which which includes cares about how we feel about things in some of yeah the best scholarly comment on this that I've come across is by this more indirect learning model harmony who says basically Jefferson left it to people to suck Why gave them happiness? So I mean that happiness is, if you think about it, and extraordinarily private thing, what gives one person happiness, doesn't is another person just contained. Some people love to play golf, to me it would be misery and carnit chasing a little right fall over all those green hills underbeating sun. , it's a very private, it's extremely private, it's extremely personal. And there's a kind of an assurance that you can do what gives you, what gives you the kind of contentment. What the? that was left to individuals to decide. Still, we have a pure tantal streak that is also part of our heritage. For a lot of us, the notion that we're going to just pursue the happiness. It seems trivial, it lacks dignity, it lacks moral seriousness. Today on our radio program, a defense of the American notion that there is a decent and something just because it makes us happy. Our show as always, WB Esech cargo. of the city and a completely pointless activity. Back to when happiness startle downward  rain, which we examine one small case in which the pursuit of happiness goes to far. Back to me. When I rush eyes or smiling, we ask why one certain group of New Yorkers is far more blah. When happiness startle downward  rain, which we examine one small case in which the pursuit of happiness goes to far. Back to me. When I rush eyes or smiling, we ask why one certain group of New Yorkers is far more blah. or happier problem. In Chicago then they ever are back home in New York, at 4, had to be happy one man's guy. Say what's. At one, one man's treasure is another man's trash. We begin to show about the pursuit of happiness, with a story about an actual pursuit, scavenger hunt that takes hundreds of hours to create, then through the sheer pleasure of it. David Rackoff left the sober peace and relative quiet. of his apartment this summer for a night out with a few dozen happiness seeking strangers. Jamie, captain of the White Team, is reading the instructions to us, his five team members. Apparently, when we solve our first clue, we are to call into HQ, the Mirror Center, where it seems our progress will be plotted on the wall-sized map with push-ups. This update is your communication on the Master Map and starts a one-hour timer. One hour after this call, if you haven't found the next clue, you can call again. for a hint. One hour? Oh my god. Half an hour after we give you the first hint you're entitled to a second hint. 15 minutes after that, if you still haven't found the next clue, we tell you where it is. Although this scavenger hunt is called midnight madness, and it's modeled after a night in a movie but the same name, a movie that mat label it's the organizer of this event to see dozens of hundred times. It is happily only after eight in the evening . When all 17, some 40 of us in all can be. on the plaza in front of the world for its end. Believe me, it will be midnight soon enough. Our playing field for the evening is Manhattan anywhere south of Hastin and East of Broadway, an area which includes Wall Street, Chinatown, Little Italy and all of them lowly outside. We will move from location to location following a series of stealthily hidden clues. I joined the Chinese team because  most people. I'd  to think of myself as being spontaneous. Ready for him? Huh? It will prove to be an evening of hard-won insights. The first is, I am lousy at puzzles, riddles, and games, but they negative capacity to solve clues. Closed three eyebrows, and we're sending a bag alone. Three eyebrows, turns out to be an immigrant for Bowery and Hester. Not some downtown picture, free to call out, as I actually suggest. It's a clear that says the shortest distance to the subway station. This is a shortening unit square, 5-room unit street, and 5-room wall street. This is actually the Delante Street subway, not the Brooklyn Bridge stop as I've mastered, which is a good $6 camera out of the way. There you go. There you go. Very clever, very clever. It's a picture of the artist formerly known as Prince, and the sight of his Queen Elizabeth. This is a clue directing us to go corner, Prince, from the Christmas streets. Even I got back, I'm not completely. All told it will be an evening of over seven hours duration, or I probably give up. My team's paradernations will take. of spoofing patches on the foot from the World Trade Center to Bari and Bayer to Bari and his McDonald's on Mal Street to the Brooklyn Bridge to the Balyam City Street subway to you get the picture. There is anger, there is scratch grey, and there is a farm out of the board. Case in point one particularly long stretch, when all 40 of us stand around on the corner of Prince and Elizabeth for the better part of an hour. Watching happy diners come and go from a minutes p big and won at incredibly clear session restaurants. side with our feet on April 5th cruise. It just feels a pun is raining. As object is this extended light ring sounds, it's not. Some of the clues are downright beautiful. In the Deliancey Street subway, the clue was a perfect mockup of the transit light ball. The fun, the paper stock, right down. to the two M's for Midnight Maths, printed in that bold white upper case letter in a black circle that indicates a subway line. Everything about it is such a flawless imitation that we walked by it three times before realized. One year, the game masters printed the clue in fake Chinese takeout and threw them around the building. I asked them Michael's Maths per game. Master about his fake comment. There was a moment sort of during the damage control when everybody was in battery park and so we got to see everyone at that time and kind of walk around and that to me was a really nice moment. It's no great revelation but he and I might have different ideas of what cause the dude's a good time. People are rare in one person's gone safe, the lot is another person's abridgement of their most sacred right. One person's Barbara Streisand concert is another person's Barbara Streisand concert is another person's Barbara Streisand concert. I know the moment Dan is talking about. It was when we were all at the warm and warm. Let's start with a beautiful plaza right by the warm, with about a dozen huge concrete slabs, 20 feet high by 18 feet wide, engraved with the names of the young man who gave their lives for their comfort. The players walk around, shining their flat. of the tablets, looking for the names of soldiers, correspond to the clue that has been dredged up from the depths of the Hudson River. I might agree with that about how nice this moment was if it was during the day, but it is close to four in one. My brain has long-saint stopped functioning. My feet hurt, I am tired, and I am very, very cranky. Rats, scarring to the quotas nearby, the skydows buzzing about our ears, their thorax is known as a full of questionile virus. Just then, Jamie runs into his friend. This friend is not part of our game. I'll let you in on some. If you were a gay man walking through a dark New York city market 330 in the morning, there is a reason for it. And that reason is not. So you will run into someone . In fact, the highest person you want to run into is especially is their problem. Actually, the second class person you want to run into is someone  accompanied by dozens of charming amateur seats with flashlights. Jamie's friend leads to hasty retreat. My current psychopathic rounds go back to passing the tombstones while I enter chemical. on my second inside of the evening. I am no son, no fun at all. Or perhaps I'm just a different kind of son. I decide to follow my own bliss, the bliss of the quitter, the kill joy, the pill. Emerging from the park, I hail a calf, perfectly through the deserted tenets for the walls of the area. I settle back into the sea of the taxi. I'm on my way home to bed and for almost the first time that. even I feel happy take a break up Act 2, when happiness hurdles down  rain from heaven, Hackman Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase, pursuit of happiness into the declaration of independence. The phrase was kind of knocking around. People used it. And one of the ideas that it referred to was the notion that people would find happiness when they did things for the common good, team together for everybody's world being. Breathe in, product out here. And many times we rarely hear the word used this way, and phrase was this way. If anything, when we talk about people pursuing happiness, they're pursuing their own happiness. Sometimes. ( först of the word saying translated, Surf 노래 begins and continues to arise again, and omg it's a little harder than71. I want to do a speech this way that I can hear that they are at the expense of others. We have this short straightened Thomas Bellar about one of the smallest possible examples of this more selfish kind of pursuit that we go from the incidentate amusing of ourselves to less sense. Now, Exfader grew up in an apartment on the 14th floor of large pre-war built to have an entire block of recycled glass. From this bedroom window, which looked normal, you could see a broad patch of sky. The tops of buildings are multi-tube wooden water towers. And after the left, there's a goal only if he pressed his cheek to the window pane, not to move. The view that most fascinating in the however was the one that he had by the King Directing Tower. Once when he was six, he suddenly rose from his bow, opened the narrow bathroom window above it, and he leaned out. He balanced on his wet stomach, arms and legs outstretched  Superman, contemplating what it would be  to take the plunge, and his life so far contained enough satisfaction. section, so that it can now reason the grey come to a close. The state teetering on the window cell, looking at the distant pagan below, trying to imagine what it would feel  to land here, and what it would be thinking during this thrilling seconds for a flight. Half his body felt the most familiarity of the bathroom, and the other half, wet, and green and white dollf and hung in the cold air of the unknown. The faint curiosity is to what would happen after his fall, being sooning hours and days a certain result. He pictured himself in a steam-evently concrete below, in a few minutes later, his parents would be staring confusedly at bathtub, full of murky water, empty, and thin. Image of his parents trying to make sense of the empty bath was amusing first, then became unpleasant. So one Union immersed. Transconviction of Richie got up on ledge. He got down close to window. He zoomed his back. Having decided he would not have a body on one go. He'd be entering smaller, less valuable options. First, a crack. He went spinning out the window and out of sight and it's absolutely simple. Next for waterbombs is Boboid. down her trajectory, it was monitored to lay ground, after which the small figure of dormitory appeared hustling out onto the wet pavement, looking up. Alex loved sight of this tiny figure, so formidable in real life, appearing on the sidewalk, and watching from above he was usually spotting from the ground. Things were different, his friend Walker's on. Walker lived a few blocks south of Alex and Riverside Drive, also on the 14th floor. They were 10. new best friends. Walker was constantly surprising him with new and interesting ways to express malice. Through directed throwing things at the window, he was Walker, introduced the idea, he made a target. The windows of Walker's apartment all looked at overrides in the room. Directly below, the guard-loam patch of sidewalk onto which people arrived at actors and walked into a stage. In the stand-curture of Walker's Kitchen, we go, both holding on to a hot full of water-balanced on-ledge, waiting for a suitable fit. They once observed, in a track to be on one and walking risk-lute, in the UK of Flowers and her hands, towards the man who was standing with several circumstances around him, so they waited for a taxi, right in his own view. He was a perfect fit. They were about to dust the man's water, but it looked  something incredibly romantic was a bad toy car. some long-awaited reunion in Alex and Walker instinctively held back and lost. The woman had a strapless top-on, even from the distance of 14 floors Alex could make out the subtle chamber for shoulder muscles and the trenduous softness for breasts, so they bounced up and down with each step. Flowers and delicate pink petals. Nameth sukkiesons stared at her as she approached the old strides. Spoty was still an unmoving. Skaz fixed. He was oblivious to everything else in world. She walked right up to him, and bashed him in the face, Rookay, a violent forehand snitch. Pedal scattered  that. And without missing a beat, she turned on her heel, and stomped back in direction she had come, still clutching considerably less flowery. Man, just a... Alex and Walker were so fantastic. by the scene if we're not to call a walker. Other people were less fortunate. Alex and Walker would stand guard at the kitchen window until someone appeared on their side drive. They would be timed to size up the target. Gate, posture, clothes. At a certain ideal moment, water would fall forward from the apat and one solid transition. and mass, and then split in half, and then in half again, and again, so that would start at a single glob on the 144 ended as a thousand pallets of water on the ground. Aalpade and darkened, and the victim became completely still. This momentary freeze was, for some reason, the most delicious part. There was one set of victims, for state. Alex's mind for a long time afterwards. A little girl wearing pink coat, white stockings, and shiny black shoes, and will down the sun-estrange, half-step behind her mother. She looked as if she were unweight in two or from her mother. She walked on steady steps, and her mother walked beside her, looking down and talking, but also giving the girl independence. They were two small objects, alone on the sidewalk. Waterhead. ground and you grate his in mass and you froze  everyone else. But in the several seconds between the core and the splatter, his Alex watched the water fragment into sand, which remained his pan of regret left up in his stomach instead of more phenomenal thrill. As he watched the jerky awkward expressiveness of a little girl walking me water's widening net. He understood there was a small, corrupt moment about to take place. one kid introducing another to the random one or fate in battle. Ring ups and call it all my head and just  the guys need up to big for his bed nothing and change the fate those ring ups and call it all my head and take it all So I just give you some talk and do the song. And I said I didn't  the way you got the stuff. Sleep in on the job. The Thomas Bellard Reading from his novel The Sleep of Rard is coming up a second story that New York cops, which will show you as another side of them that you have also never imagined. And that's in a minute of public radio-ternational when our program continues. detector. This is American live from our class. If you're gonna program with course which is some theme, the latest program, the pursuit of happiness. Any sorts of coincidence, but in the years since Thomas Jefferson declared that it was our annual annual goal right to pursue happiness, we have pursued it about this aggressively as any group of people could. Main that pointless, time-waste activities, a new place out of, a television industry, a lot of extreme sports, no equipment. For the world's biggest proponents of the idea of just hitting the road and starting a new life with the other. when does not suit you? We perpetually create new ways to have fun. Which is sort of the subject of the next act today, show at three when Irish eyes are smiling. Every year the Emerald Society, Association of Irish Chicago Police Officers, flies and policemen from New York City, for Chicago's two big St. Patrick's Day's prayers. Every year the met by a group of Southside women, smirk my producer, Jewish Snyder, plus a squad. There are two main Irish coppires in Chicago. One is called Dugans, in the Natso Irish neighborhood. town, the other is not so Irish named Iris, located in Chicago's 12th police district. And normally these bars are pretty tame, filled mainly with men watching sports on the overhead TVs. But on the Saturday of St. Patrick's Day weekend, everything changes. The bars are filled with women, who are there for the New York City police officers, who are there for the women, who are there because they get to act in a way they never normally act. It's  normally would make out in the bar, especially in our age ritual for that. five six and a half to nine. Sure. We give somebody a big smooch to the bar. That's totally acceptable that we can. Kelly Farriter is a waitress of students and she's the person who originally told me about the New York City cops coming to Chicago. But when I called her recently to find out more, she said she'd really have to take you to the source. So we got together one night in Tammy Tansillos, living room. Surrounded by police paraphernalment. Please please, please, please. Please, please. Sure. It's photographs. Tammy is 40. She completely beautiful. and is an attorney state of Illinois. She's also the original near-� school. It all started about 13 or 14 years ago. At the time, Tammy knew a lot of Chicago cops because she trained supervisors in the police department. And one Friday night,  most appointments, she went to do gigs after she got off work. And one of the cops that I knew was there and he had a bunch of guys with them. No one was in uniform or anything. And he said, I have a favorite ask you and he said, Why, I just got them. We're okay. This was at least 12 years ago. I had on those big beetle glasses a stupid plant skirt and look more  a school teacher than anything else Which is an advanced thing but not in that so it's anyway so He said I need to help me I said when you need me said well I've got this group of 12 New York policeman here They're here for the weekend for the parades and I was hoping you could help me to entertain them And I said whoa, ho ho hold out a minute here What do you mean by enter And he said seriously you're a lot of fun to hang out with, just have a few beers and keep him company and talk to him. I can't talk to him on myself. So I begrudgingly said yes. Well, we had so much fun that from that day on, I was glued to him. The first year there were 12 guys brought by the M.O.C.I.D. and Shikada. year, it had grown to 166 men and women in New York City police department to march in the same patch of state parades. And it's no wonder they come. They're fed at the parades at parties thrown in their honor and at the local bars. They're kept on the night ten rare that seems completely geared toward making the police officers feel kings and kings. They are ready to go from the minute that they are heated Chicago and that's why a little bit they are followed around in there are young ladies that I think The word is on the street that they're coming to town. I've gotten to be more of a mother figure to some of these guys. I mean, there's a drill. When I show up at the grade, I see them and I say, make sure that you take your shields off. Make sure that you keep your uniform. Make sure that you stay with the group. Make sure that you don't give away your collar bra as to early because it's going to go up and stock as the weekend goes by. Okay. A quick explanation. The answers have to take. the shields or their badges because the New York Police Department doesn't officially sanction Patricia Cogga. They have to watch their clothes, their hats, their jackets, shirts, because it's the drinking continues and is the flirting continues, women are constantly taking things and trying them on. One year, when the weekend was over, Tammy had to FedEx wanted for $300 uniform jackets back to New York pre-sync. And then there's the collard everybody, all the wind especially are buying from Caled. And I'll show you what that is. Now I have a box about the size of a shoe box full of little numbers. And I couldn't find it, but I did find this little. And this is what they are. They are, as you can see, they're just about a sort of an inch high, depending upon the letter about an inch long. But that says two four. That would be the two four. That would be the 24th precinct in New York. I mean, it becomes a real close fast. And I'll show you what that is. I saw pictures of what I looked  by the end of the night. I mean, I was getting a little frisky there. And there was one here where I was looking really  I was having a good time for a long time. There we go. And you're in a police officer shirt. And that's just not asher. That would be a sergeant shirt. Sorry, sorry. I don't know. Yeah, but these are all the pictures you ever do. Oh, no, I have tons and tons of pictures. In fact, those send pictures. This is a picture of Mike who is the person that now is still coordinating the trip. And you can tell he's having a good time to smile on his face. Cute young lady sitting on his lap. Ryan. Ryan is the police officer that I met the first year that they had to appear. I probably always had a little bit of crush on him. But then there's Joey. This weekend, same project stay weekend. is not really Tammy's actual life. She's a grown up and attorney who's now in a long-term relationship. But that's a beauty of all of the new of course because none of it is real. Tammy says that all normal real life waste dating don't apply that weekend. How many romances do you think that you've had through the St. Patrick St. because? During this pause, I can't tell if Tammy's deciding whether to answer the question. I think I have checked the other side. I'm taking a shine to a few gentlemen over the years, but always realizing that I've had a guy come back over the past couple of years that I've enjoyed some time with, but I'm seeing someone now, so , your life doesn't stop. Once, when Tammy was dating someone and seeing Patrick's day was coming down, she told her boyfriend that he may not be seeing much of her dad weekend, that maybe it was a good time for him to go on a short. three-day vacation for Wisconsin. She says the following year if she didn't even have to ask me. We just knew. All of this might come as a surprise to the citizens in New York City where to put it mildly. These say New York cops don't put this kind of graduation. they say, nobody's profit is own man. Even Tammy who started a website called NYPD Love can't explain what makes them seem so larger than life. Tammy comes from a whole Chicago law enforcement She says she loves Chicago. but the New York police feel different, special. Maybe out here in the second city, the NYPD gets respect because they seem  the real police, the police with CNTV, the police who just sound  this. I think it's something about those assets. Oh, they're New York accents? Yeah. It's so real. It's so real. I mean, they sound so gen. And most of them really are. To put all this in context, this happens in the out-of-the-art. This happens in the out-of-the-art. Irish Partish of Congress outside where lots of people have processed family friends. During a weekend when the whole neighborhood turns itself over to one big part, the main event is the South Side Sea Paddy's breakdown Sunday. The parade route on Western Abnias line with dingy little Irish bars, the sidewalks are clogged, backyard parties are thrown, even someone does big white tents, and you'll hear this song sung over and over. Over the South Side Irish,  fathers were before, come from the... in the city and where I was to the core from Bridgeport to Beverly from Midway to South Shore or where the South Side Irish and then it goes on and on and on. I couldn't even have sung it never heard that about 10,000 times. It's even on the two packs actually and a lot of their neighborhood problems. And most people in background up on the South Side have everything on its grade. A lot of people know that. I'm not kidding themselves so they take them. And you go on up out there and it's sort of being a family event too because people's parents, they know you go to the parade but they're going to have dinner, wait back for the house, come back to the dinner. , you go to some of those ants. There's a lot of, I guess it's kind of  Christmas without the presents, but a lot more beer. Or maybe  New Year's Eve, I suggest. Tammy and Kelly both say no. It's way better. There's no pressure going with your past. or have the right date or do something significant to Martin other year. The great thing about same patterns is that it's not really about anything. So you can make it into whatever you want. The American Life Senior Producer Jasonette. When the city iris where the crack is always best, where every day is, patties day and every one. If you're Irish on the North side or Irish on the West, welcome to the South Side, come join me, Irish fast. We're the South Side Irish as our fathers were before. We come from the Indicity and we're Irish to the Lord. From red, foreign, to Beverly, from mid-waves and South Shore, we're the South Side Irish. Let's sing it out, watch forward. Our parents came from males from sports. At four, had to be happy one man's died. Finding happiness is the serious business. Or candy. Think many of us requires that. Well, Nancy Haptank tells this story of somebody who decided to turn something that made him unhappy. Yeps. Marcus Johnson runs a boxing jam on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, and he's a great teacher. To explain what makes him. So good. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever had a parent try to teach you a sport? Where they push you way too hard and you can see them getting more and more frustrated and disappointed inside you give up, but on the outside you keep going and they keep going to, and both of you just end up miserable. Marcus is the opposite of that. He's  a good date where everything feels both easy and serious at the same time. He's always paying attention, always murmuring directions. courage. I'll raise up, just  there. All of Marcus's clients are adults except this one, who's the son of a friend. Josh is 11 and this is his first lesson. Josh is, frankly, adorable. He has big brown eyes, dark curly hair, and dimples on his smiles. And he's making a very common beginner's mistake, which is starting his punches from to far back. He's trying to remove it. Marcus keeps telling Josh he has to be quicker and throw shorter punches. Finally Marcus just starts moving the pads away before Josh can hit them. To show him what can happen to be a wind up. He's the one who's not here. Come on, so keep on your hands  he let me know. That'd be great. That's right there. That's how it's got. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Did you catch that? Josh made a face and said, it tastes  I just had a fruit roll up. What did that show for? A fruit roll up. I mean, no. These vines are supposed to be vines or not. It's true of them had a fall and Josh visibly improved over the course of just an hour. You are last, which is the hardest part of box. And something really sad happened. After Josh was finished, his father walked over. He'd been on his cell phone in the back of which him the whole time. And he started making Josh do these special tough guy pushups, something about keeping your butt in the air and only lowering chest to the floor. And then he should cell phone that. One more time. One more time. And he said, you see, you're about to hit the floor. before you chatted. You done? Or you did? You could just see Josh withdraw and get silent over the course of these exercises. But then even after that, then I swear I am not making this up. Josh's father made him read a paragraph about responsibility from some pamphlet out loud twice because Josh stumbled first. No, stop. Man. You will. But right now you have to read it, leave love. Responsibility starts with saying you are cause in the mat. What makes Marcus such a good teacher is that he's not an overt eager parent. And maybe it helps that as a kid, Marcus never even liked, but he did it to please his dad, a college track star who almost went to the Olympics, in dream-to-turning Marcus will help you wait champion's world. You're gonna be my ticket out of the ghetto. tell Marcus 13. Then after Marcus's mother died and his father got caught up in the wave of crack and he put his mid-80s. His father lost his job, power got cut off. And Marcus still kept boxed because the guys at the gym were the only ones who looked at fed him through the school, letting him stay with him sometimes. As he told me in the car one day, it was the only part of his life with any promise. I was boxed and I never liked, but I started making myself , because I wanted some life. things. I worked a nice light. I should tell the guys that the car lock. I was a ninth grade team grade. what? How many gold medals? I make the Olympic team return pro at the beginning. Champion at the world. I'm gonna come to buy car for me. Okay. All right young man keep on hanging there. , all right. Speak to me. I would  to have at least two big screens. The Marcus is driving around doing errands for a party who's playing with both him. He's invited around 70 people, friends and clients to come watch the Oscar Delahoya sugar Shane Mosul fight. The parties in a few days and Marcus is bringing me in two huge televisions, catered soul food and security to watch the door. Most of his clients are agents, producers and writers to these shows. behind the scenes big list. No one who's naming me now. Marcus needs more clients. He's had the gym for less than a year and rent aside. The party is wiping him out and doesn't want to talk about that. Get back into the car after a quick stop. I am happy. What I am happy by. I got the money. No. Alright, I got one. I hate that. Is it party? Can't tap in you out? No, I mean, I don't know, I got one. No. What? I got one. I had a bunch of them on me. I got money, slow and. Gooo, gooo. I got millions, baby. Fruit. Marcus's single-minded goal since he was little has been to be happy. A lot of people find happiness to abstract or maybe too ambitious goal to aim for, but to Marcus it's very real. It's something he trains for, he plans for, he believes in. He has a commitment to be. When he's not enjoying something anymore, he just stops it, stops doing it, stops thinking it, stops talking about it. It's hard work. daily work. in the car at the bank, he won't talk about not everyone. He'll pretend he does have money. when I watch and get some bad news for credit card company and they all, he just stops himself in the middle of getting mad about it says, I'm hungry. when he started teaching boxing, he made a rule, no hitting in face, just because he always hated it. It hurt. So it is Jim, you learn to punch hard, move your feet and keep your stamina up. but no getting in face. He still doesn't  box. But boxing is what he knows. He wants to use it to get to the point with the stop box. What he really wants is to be an act, a model, both of which he's done a little bit of. Whenever one of his clients brings a celebrity by the gym, Puff Daddy, Mark Walvers, Ice Cube. He can just feel it, just getting close. Can you believe it? Somebody! I hid in his heart, he wrote Harriet the spy for children. I look at it. Ah! Ah! Harriet the spy! Marcus is in the ring of Dudley Tree, television and screenplay writer. They're practicing a rapid fire, jab-hook, jab combination. When Marcus first started getting more and more Hollywood people  Dudley's clients, he found he was afraid to speak a lot of the time. He'd hear a voice in his head telling him. Bence to power. shut up and say, man, just ask him, question, oh, you're gonna make yourself a bad, no look  me fool. So he made a decision. He was just gonna stop worrying all the time about looking bad at front of these rich college educated white people. It was miserable. He made a change. I just listened to him all the time. And say the words that they said. And he used the words  they used him. And he really does this. I heard him do it with me. We were in the middle of a long talk. about the years that learning to box can help over cop. And somehow the word conjuring. We feel that I know. And it's things that come to us. And I'm , and I'm , well, what we're going to look for? Not dream, but conjugate up, conjuring up. Things that can conjure up those. So went back to the word four minutes later, making sure we've got it. He's going to catch him. can say I were to be a stranger. It's not a conjure up. Just, what is somebody talking about behind it? I take my personal. All of those things conjured up in your mind. Fifteen minutes later, he used it again when he was talking about his own fear, the sphere of speaking. And this time when he said it, he looked at me in my app because he knew he was doing. Listen to people talk all the time, they're doing days on the phone, and this thing won't go once, no more漲 out garbage. , conjure up words and sound smart. Los Angeles,  every other big city in America, is segregated between black and white, but it's more complete here. The dividing line is 10 freeway. North of it is West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Hollywood. South of it, remarks grew up. His English, South Central, Watts. Separation. is so complete that if you live north of the tent, it's possible to go for a week without laying eyes on a single black person. Only a certain kind of person ever makes the jump on one side of the tent to be other. And one of the things that makes Marcus capable of it is that it's not a chore for him to find out about new things. He's curious about her. He enjoys it. In high school, when he spent a year at a mostly white school, he started getting into heavy milk. Quiet, riot. Now he eats an organic salad for lunch every day, kind of food you've never even heard of. One day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day. Parties in two days, Marcus is sprucing up. He's already had a manicure, now he's at his system of shells, causing topology class to get his hair rebrated. The shells are going to show the class how to breed by doing Marcus's hair. He walks through the room introducing himself to everyone. A process that involves a blend of charm, charm. tentiveness and self-based so potent for the room feels beauty by the end of it. It's not just because he's six-one, high-cheap-bones, model-good-looking, huge smile. His charm doesn't only work with women. I've seen him work it over the phone, the strangers, someone he'd put off in his heart. He's interested in people. He asks where they're from, where they live. He notices things about them. While his head is under a process, a friend of Michelle is the standing next to him. I'll be the shampoo. How old is he child? Two. He's a holly's child. Two. He said, how old is your child? I was talking to her. Yeah. Maybe it was just a look, yes. I asked Marcus about it later. How he'd known she had a child. He couldn't tell me. didn't know how he knew. He just had a feeling. What's the life of the boy? What is your friend? I'm out of VIP. I'm going to be able to sit and ring a lot of time. It's the afternoon of the party. Marcus is all energy. He's arranging chairs, checking the angle of the two big TV's. One of which is blaring movie about last night. Pre-fights don't start for another two hours. The main event is in five hours. The caterers are setting up tables for food. They're gonna just make them move and close if they want to, , this, this, this ain't no pass it, they better, fix them chairs or they can see. It's  a backyard barbecue. , I know we here in Hollywood and Hollywood is gonna be in here, but we're doing it the old fast way. They're gonna get your plate on your paper plate, , get your classic pocket spoon and your water. So, in 45 minutes, the food is set up. Smell's great and there's a ton of it. Enough for 100 people. Cornbread, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken. Everything's all set. The TVs are on the right channel. Doors are open. Over the next several hours, people trickle it. Some family, some friends from Inglewood in South Central. Marcus is pastor. People who knew from boxing. But Hollywood never shows up. Hinesis had three years. People whose Passover's sators he's attended. Only two of Marcus' clients have died, and one of them is the kid, Josh. I'm one of about half a dozen white people. Marcus' frenzy party energy dissipates slowly over the hours, but he stays charming with everyone he talks to. Seems genuinely happy to see the people who do come. His poise is painful to watch. During the five hours of party, and in the days afterward, I never hear from suggests that anything that likes. to support me. If you ever think such a thought, I'm sure you stop yourself. There's something I haven't told you about, my eyes. Two weeks before I started interviewing him for this story, he found God. As Marcus puts it, he gave his life to Christ. The whole time I was interviewing him. All I wanted to talk about was what he did to get what he is, and all he wanted to talk about. is how God was the real force behind every good thing in his life. It frustrated me. Marcus' faith kept intruding on the story I wanted to get. I wanted to know about Marcus' life. His experience as choice, the hard work creating to happen life. That was going to be my hope point in the story. But we pretend happiness is some natural state and we just fall into it. We stop running around and doing some ambitious, really self-resist. When in fact it takes tremendous effort. hurt to be happy. But if I'm looking at Marcus as a study and how to be happy, then there's something besides hard work that you need to do happy. You need faith. Not necessarily religious faith, although when Marcus is case it is. But you do need to believe that happiness is possible. You need to accept that. That's what God gave Marcus. My motto is, feed the faith. Stop the doubt. Now. I just have faith, I just have faith, I'm all you don't faith. Did everything, faith. What did you go on how did you keep going for it? I'm sorry. I'm just going without believing God. I just want my strength, courage, faith, and I wasn't going to quit. I was going to find out, I wanted to lie to that I won, I wanted to lie to. He's in happens. I wanted I wanted him on earth. I asked him I won. I lived on the street here when I started boxing. I thought a boxing was blocked right here. We're driving down the street Marcus lived on when he was 13. Manhattan Place. His godmother still lives on the block. Time is over. Hey, yeah, I'm off. How you doing, son? Fine. We only stay for a few minutes, just long enough for him to tell her the big news. Yes, what? What? What do you mean? What do you mean? No. What is that? What is that? It's the end of your career, don't you? I see. That's the greatest thing you do ever done in life. I see. It's myself. What have I been doing this whole time? Okay. That's right. In the hands of the Lord is nothing. Nothing. Is he last day with him? At this point, she abruptly turns to me. What if he turns to me? Well... Marcus is still talk and asks, do  God? I shake my head and she gives me a look so startling. The combination of bewilderment, pity, and disgust. And then she turns away. We can stay long, and we can go. I just stop by to say hi. Oh, you'll see. Yeah. You can go ahead again. Yeah. And say, yeah. I bless. Yeah. We get in the car and drive back across the tent. We've got love and joy. We've got love and joy. We've got love and joy. I have you ever been so long ago. Have you ever felt long ago? At the end of the day. The program was produced by the 7th and 7th of August.
