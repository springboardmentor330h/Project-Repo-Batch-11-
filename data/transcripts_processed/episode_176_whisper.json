Why can't it just let it go? Eric Potter drove to the inauguration protest with swiping kids, but he has never protested anything before. Never before. And what about this, Stephanie? Recons tuition has been subverted and people don't say care. You go, our support is... They're starting to be election. Not strong, . Are you so mad? Extreme it. If he's the rightful winner, I don't have a problem within the White House, but I don't believe he's the rightful winner, and we will never know that. We should count all the votes. And that hasn't happened. Republicans simply do not understand this. They think the Democrats are being divisive and unreasonable during the recounts, and it's gone. They won't let it go. Get over it. I mean there's nothing that that can do. Get over it. Do you think there's any fair basis anything that's saying about the part of E.C. Oh, we were such a farce. The whole thing was. Counting, recounting, counting, recounting. You could have gone and recounted all of the United States. And states that Bush, lost, just barely lost. We could have gone and recounted that. But if it's always been people at the extremes of the political parties, we're really better, we're just furious at the other side. But as it's election dragged on for weeks as far, it seemed  more and more people got caught up in those kinds of feelings. And now, where is this feeling supposed to go? On an inauguration date, 40% of Americans still thought the George Bush had not been legitimately elected as president. It's all our people. I think they're certain. The device that even sang, it's a lot of people out loud to see this device. When the interview Democrats think that most of them say is that it's not that they want to throw George Bush out of office at this point. They don't even do that right now. It's  they still have these moments of surprise when it happened to scene in the news paper, the long television. right, it's present. It's real. On the other side, a Republican named Chris Robling, a former election commissioner here in Chicago, did this attempt for between him and his Democrat friends, Democrats can be so arrogant in some sort of problems. They go down and it's only gotten worse. You took a tape recorder, talked to a friend Kathleen about him. How does this affect your view of somebody  me that I'm a Republican and that I was for this guy and that I was for what happened in Florida? You told me you weren't for what happened Florida, you said you were ashamed of how you got left. I know. for the fact that he ultimately won. Of course you are. Republicans were for power at all costs. That's a creepy, nasty, vicious attitude. So my creepy, nasty, vicious. I have thought that about you since we, since I found out you were really a Republican. Yeah, there's a really creepy side to it. There is, I'm sorry. So I'll probably have fewer and fewer Republicans in terms because I don't see the be able to get over it. Both NVIDIA and BZ Chicago, the Public Radio International, the American Life, my request. Today on our radio program, moving on after the election, Democrats trying to Republicans urging them to, urging the Republicans to be a man to get the feeling that they're not entirely over the part of the BZ. either. Our show today in five acts, act one, you're not present into me, which we examine the non-intersecting realities of the two sides in the political spectrum right now. At two, a brief history of a public and time, ready to David Brock gives us the inside story of how we got to this point of bitterness in that way. And it is not pretty my friend. Of being, bedroom politics, in which I happily married couples suddenly get politics, different. politics making it harder than to move on now. Backboard, let us reason together in which we try to get each side to understand the other in the Supreme Court case, Bush versus Gore. Back five, what would  who do? I chat with an African American minister in Florida who is trying not to be mad about the election because it is against his religion. Stay with us. At one, you're not the president of me. But back in President Clinton was being impeached. At least Republicans and Democrats agreed on the basic facts. He pulled around with an intern and he lied about it. The only excuse of a weather this was an important violation in the law. And part of it. And he thought it would be possible for anyone to say this. And part of it, things were much more bitter. Partly because the two sides did not even agree on the basic facts of what was happening. What was happening? These two entirely different pictures of the world. We're very little of them. Here is Jonathan Chay, the new republic, except the sky blue and roll, telling the story of the recount. But David Harrow, salon magazine, except described in certain, Jonathan Chay's thoughts. Statistically, you can prove without it doubt that Al Gore would have won four of the you're not default in machines. Now from there, you can argue the way we're about how to do that. Will there be a shadow? the best is the way the mind will be, which is they did a precinct by precinct analysis and simply looked at how many non-votes there were in each precinct. And then they found it go over the front by the cross. So for each precinct you say, okay, all these people who's votes, we do not, they split this way, this means we can go into this and we can push. Let's just subscribe to the un-counted balance, the same proportions in the weekend. That's exactly right, okay. Okay. So if you do that,  the golden ones. And this is, this is, this is, you can dispute it. This is statistically as sound as anything can be. In the only reason that there's this big boot line, the left is because Al Gore said Al, to steal the election after it was over. , there's this line that, , let's count every vote. Al Gore didn't want to count every vote. What about the Republican Haters in Florida? They were, didn't. But ever six times as many as a word Democrat can't least, they didn't get the votes to. By focusing on four counties in Florida, which are overwhelmingly Democrat, where Democrats control the judging process and the whole process. That's a prescription for a kind of civil war. Because what could Republicans do? They had to stop the Democrats from manufacturing a vote. If you acknowledge that God would have won enough, you'd have no chance, which means. Then the worst thing you can say about you is that He's trying to steal it, He's already by the people. Now, it may be the case that the physical evidence for resolving that problem before it's not strong. It may be the case, the dimple chance, aren't clear enough marks and very few. But I guess I would have two in principle, but I might have a number two, anyone who's actually seen about it, who's I have, would I think conclude that a simple chat is something. We've had a few of these mouse fedemonic officers trying to, none of us is going to be a different chat unless there's something knocking down. Now the reason that's important to note, is that the damage is correct. of why you have difficult balance is that something blocks the ballot, , it's missing line, , for all the child, the bell, , she built up on your support, it's blocking the pool, you can't punch the child, , really because she's... Mm-hmm. The Republican theory is that voters were putting their stylus down on the floor or, , cheese for a month, by the thousands, but if you work it one of these things. realize it's really deep. If you're able to constantly, you can't play. So the fact of a different thing is evidence of an inability to constantly. When the votes were technical of these people, , death ballots pop the chairs. And they just tend to be in front of the whole nation with the new work. Do you think they could have been a way to get a fair cat? No, dimpled chads. No. The only. The fair cow is the machine tin. With all its unfairness in that not two paranox, the sheans, so they make the stakes, it tends to be distributed even or at least blinded. There's no way to hand out the naked fair because it's subject. Well, I think that people should just let it go. The election is of, you can't, , country with 300 million people. , a judicate this and in the night, you just can't want to country. It is no actual cat. That's what people are interested in. I mean, I really think this is the worst thing you're seeing on people, as long as I'm upon. I guess I regard Bush as a victim. , I think about every time Bush says something , Well, I won by, , even though I won by a narrow amount, , what about what if he lost? What if I was a negative 10000? , stop with the saying this is an old jitter, an old jitter president. And he got an email with boats or something. And there's a very close election that put it done either way. And, , start participating. In a constructive process, as to bring the sides together.

I'm not sure I can learn to live it but but I guess Every cloud has a silver light and that my age I don't have to live a pretty much larger That's right the one comforting dying someday is knowing you will never have to watch crossfire now So how do we get to this point where our politics is so bitter? If Brock has a particular view of this, he used to be a right-wing journalist at Hitman, first he wrote in Investigative Book about the New Deal, then he was the very first reported mentioned Paula Jones by name in this story, which led you to say, her going public and soon Clinton, which led you to him lying in a deposition, why is it that he became Browns with his impeachment? He is uniquely situated to give a first-hand history. The vain-hopping conservative backlash Americans witnessed after the 2000 election is rooted in the war of the tradition nominees that began in late 1980s when President Reagan and Bush tried to roll back decades of socially progressive court decisions by confirming conservative judges to the bench. In Republican eyes, the Robert Port nominations are the same as the claims promised. and tax, lies, and misrepresentations . They've had revenge. Newt Gengrich was in on the tone setting more from the start. Writing shortly after Bork's defeat, he promised to fight the Democrats, quote, with the scale, immigration, and the savagery that is true on the innocent wars. Gengrich and the people around him were not conservatives in the original sense of the word. They were radicals who consciously adopted the street fighting political style of the 60s for their own ends. In the early 90s, English's posse hung out at the Capitol Hill Roadhouse of Glover Norkins, an anti-tax lobbyist who knew a public one's call, the Che Guevara, the Republican Revolution. At Norpice parties were conservatives convened to bring pegs and graphs about the latest liberal averages. We tended to form a Reagan and Bush Street fighter making money. We could be standard editor. were in Bristol, conservative Pundit Laura England, Wall Street Journal at Atoryo Rider John Fum, and many of the figures you saw kicking and screaming on TV about the stolen election. The integrity of ballots was the last thing I ever thought this crowd would get worked up over. Norchist kept a pet boa constrictor named Los Angeles Schooner after a turn to central anarchist. In the gestic portrait of Lenin, Brace Marcus Lurin and Wong, in Congress lay for central right wing crowd. Peter Paul and Mary tunes played on the steering. I asked Marcus about this once. He told me it was okay since the sixties left wing was being destroyed. After the Cold War, Inwards and Company canonly recognized that the Cold Wars demonizing us versus them will be, could still be useful. They just turned it against their domestic enemy. Now it was the Democrats they caught. on principle, in law, and non-American. The shift from one enemy to another culminated at the Republican National Convention in 1992 in Houston, where RNC Chairman Rich Bond stood on the Convention 4, instead of the Clinton's and their supporters. We are America. Those other people are not. Republicans have never forgotten that in 1992, the ballots passed for lost growth. combined with those past-for-joards Bush constituted a majority of the electorate. In their minds the will of the people feel a favorite in servant of leadership. On election 1992, then sent it minority leader Bob Dole went on national television and denounced the key in court to get, which had won the 45% of the vote as a legitimate. That made it possible to say and do anything to stop me. And boy, it will be fine. The American Spectator for example, spent $2.4 million with him for dirt on the cleanliness, including sending me to Arkansas to chase down at Land of Stories and his new student into drug-learning murder. I'd come back telling the stories weren't fair. They'd figure out a way to publish the movie. Writing a wave of anti-fliñantism to me, the Gingert Revolution swept into power in 1994. He couldn't remember! He said, quote, R secure songs of his early version of his book. In generation of right-wing robberazers, his politics in the base there's much unlaw and motion and inactive is inserted of ideas. The radical right wasn't pretending to be outraged, including for dramatic effect. The rage was real. Even when they knew they were stretching the facts to make their case. Beginning with a famous election night party that Laura Ingroon III threw to celebrate the 1994 election, my house in George Town became the center of social life of revolution. Highlight of my dinner parties was always a dramatic reading from Jennifer Fowler's steamy book, Passion Me, and Dre. Here's a typical passage. Yes, I found Doplyn and Incredibly sexy. You can still remember the way you had of staring at me. He did more than just mentally underestimate me. He was visually seducing me. And he made sure I knew it. When Gingrich's extreme anti-government agenda fell flat, serious with public of the Far Path. GOP Congressional Investigation Staffers, together with friends of mine, worked for Tim's star, quickly generated charges, counter charges, conspiracy theories, and rumors, designed to depict the Clinton's experiments.

Tired of running down dead ends, I bailed out some math board, but the right never stopped believing that the Pupon Lord in the space of music had creped and received. In the fall of 1997, months before the Monkloons did stable probe, I tended to dinner and go ahead way stream and map board. is how to build support for impeachment messages into this effort to send a bob hard trodden. John found from the Walsk group during the serious quote, not a matter of law, but if you look good there. The Republican saw their subsequent failure for a movement from office as in the storm to feed, but they didn't blame themselves. In their minds, they had simply been outmovered by the boyly, zy hate-knit-in- yeries that gather血 on their head quite delicious during the September 2nd. They would do everything they could to ensure that nothing  this ever happened. This is the political backdrop to Florida's recent drama. And it explains why Republicans so quickly concluded that Florida Democrats were including the Florida to steal the energy. And why they were so adamant about going along in the scene. It also explains why during the weekend, polls show that 75% of Democrats would have accepted Bush's teachings. The Bellers. 60% of the Republicans would accept war. During the disputed recon and in the months since, when the mainstream press talks about what happened in Florida, the story at the moment, the story that's becoming the accepted version of the news is that the Democrats and Republicans behave the same as it is. But their actions were morally equivalent. I don't think that's true. Inside the courts, we might have fought with equal fearsonists and self-interest. But outside the courtroom, Bush and his allies should have willing to rely on letter-of-contacted the Democrats didn't. Bush's top strategist, former Secretary of State James Baker, he created court decision that went against Bush as partisan and illegitimate. Republicans charged that poor could not pull ahead without shooting soon. As majority whipped on delayed pride, the theft and losses, In George Will referred to Slamon Shin Yosim, The public in morality is our William Bennett set of govick dream Florida with the legitimate. Former Senator Bob Goles suggested that with who the things might boycott before and not off. During the controversy of military markets, which spoke to me in my class day, the governor Monkou, all the called the gov forces in the Priyatta, saying that they had gone to war against men and women who served in the armed forces. There's never equivalent to the Democratic side. to all this. The Gord team was under orders not to tap the Republicans or impending the division process. When Gord spoke some interesting hinted otherwise, and called a path from Harris Thomas. The Gord staff was ordered not to be helping me. Perhaps most disturbing reports of Republican violence. Democratic officials in Florida said they picked Shakespeare shouted down by Republican cases. In Miami, they killed. in angry mob of the public and operas, organized the Congress in Tom Duway's office in Washington, stormed the recount center of critical jumps. New York Republic and Congress in Johnson's mandate the troops to shut it down, according to the Walsh which means, when the demonstrators later held the Thanksgiving Day party, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney called in and joked about the destruction. Again, there was no problem to listen to them. Now that the dust is settled, everyone seems to be proceeding as if none of this nestling is ever happening. I can't forget, even if I want to. Watching Bush-Key of the Vopis's James Baker and the Supreme Court were done, it was hard not to think of it as the top of this moon. And it's hard to believe you seem to be nasty. George Bushman is a different team of the Vopis, a uniter, not a divider, and certainly Then came forward.

And Ashcroft doesn't exactly fit any moves motion in the New York disease. The meeting was being run through both New Yorkers, the game rich periser with the help of the district. I wondered if everything I had seen in the right in the 90s was just a prayer Lord to what's about to happen. They've brought version of the story of fears in the issue of top magazine, which is now in newsstands. The practice writing a memoir of his years in the survey movement and the break from it, it'll be out in the palm. Two, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

At some point over the summer, we were, , I believe we were eating. didn't. And I got that, , I think. Actually, the book. And the only other time in our marriage that I have been that caught off the line was years ago. We have three little books. Second one is that a real, that started off in the future. And I, which is where we've had that conversation that we would know, and I'm  one morning's, I got that thing. and giving the children not sure you would even not actually want. And it felt  the ground shifted. We wanted those miracles, though. We thought, oh, lots of people. Yeah. And the same way the night he said, and you said it in the same way that I'm not sure I want to have, that the baby said, I think I might be, was it when these moments were resolved? Do I know? Oh, shoot. Shoot. We were watching the, watch, out course, speech is that speech. And, , our reaction was very different. And that first time came up, just, TV, the a problem. So, it's a lecture. season and photo, would you watch for example with the baits? Yeah, we weren't able to. No. And I knew we were, I mean, we watched the cover. So what group were you and what were in the scenes? Usually I have to down to the... No, there's an old TV. We have two television. There's a television down in, and I find it's a television that sort of... So you were banishing to the sub baseman? He was banishing. Yeah. I mean it was maybe a self-imposed egg drop, but it was. But I'd go down in our player and watch and see if you can watch. And I mean, he's fear of the two of us talking at the TV. It's just the opposite. The thing is just the opposite. The moment we say it is just the error. and you can't just accidentally be watching a bridge. That for rooms is one night of dinner and waiting for me. Tell me why is it that you're going to vote George Bush? I was still... struggling to make a changes in the net and I really did work hard and you see I've been successful in the end. So I'm just looking for me to accept that I couldn't do that. Someone said what he was doing. I hope premise was well the election will be over on the first day and we can now we back in the norm and he fixed it. He's going on for another. you're in love. , in our life you can typically, you need to follow your needs as an individual. Typically, the dot-I will  that person, or not be terribly frustrated or interested in this person. Is it the same reason? Mm-hmm. You kind of agree with me. You agree with that people? You agree with that. You agree with that team? And somehow. on this unedigree. Right. So, there? It generated a lot. And I just didn't get it. And did it get such a rights as you could because you felt , it wasn't Bush per se, it's because it said something that's God. Yeah, oh, yeah. What did it say that God? She had kind of in front of me somehow become conservative. And I was north. And what does it mean to you to be concerned? What if these groups, , you look out on your, that he features first? I don't know. And I don't. I don't. No, I'm. I don't know the right word, Gly. I'd say I felt a little bit insulted by all of that. Why? Why would she think that truly is? She knows as well as she got an over key. And I just realize that I wouldn't be able to not recognize it, but it's really the best. really good. Try to understand something that's been scattered and not provided to the inauguration. Can you tell me a story? Oh, what happened was? We got made what I would consider a pre-tapkicksification. Thank you. And what we've got ideas with the closed outreach, , we got mail, we got so much mail from the NRA, Chile. We're really kind of out there, man, for people about, , , let's just learn better, Clinton and I would just pile that up on the page. And then I'll just, in the middle of the house. And so then, I'll just then get this great huge outlook for them, this all the party. I bought that up, especially when he was never gone. We didn't even have any interest in going at all. Not political at all, right? Not involved involved in someone. Well, , I would love to go. I had my little, I had no girl invitation and beliefly reviewing it. And she just ended up. So I didn't need just possibilities going. SooJIN! you didn't even try to talk your wife in the nurse. Oh, no. Wouldn't even have dreamed. Not a change. As she knows that you might have wanted to go at all. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I didn't say it. It seems  the two of you have become married here. Well, you haven't had an issue before. You just really decided to say, OK. We're not going to talk about this anymore. And now you have one, your first one. Well, yeah, it's right. You can just have one. Not a bad one, yeah. Flip on the outside, , here at Bethesburg, there's a different link between the scene. The Mary-Make and James, right, from America. It also sounds so kind of lovable and cute. No, I don't think it's too cute. And it hasn't, I don't think I've been very lovable at all. And I haven't viewed anything here at all. Well, , I've seen Madeleine's Marvel on the Aton, the other on television. And I don't know if you ever saw them together, or three half out of the election. But, woo. It is looked awful. Really? Oh, I... It looked ... I'd never seen Carl for quite. She was. She just looked... ...as well. Are you worried about these next four years together with Bush and Noine? Are you nervous? Yeah, no, because we really do We work three I am ready I'm gonna think the midterm should be bad enough four years now I think it's okay I think it's gonna be several months Spanish I have to get involved in some big deal. It takes me  this. Watch one or something so I'm going to go up. Scott and Carrie race in Nashville, and some. Coming up, a love supreme, a hate supreme. Big aback once more. Slowly, we're certain by before court decision. This time we really, really, really use our brains. In a minute, the Bubble Video International and our program continues. This is American life, America. Each of the different projects I've got is a theme, bringing a variety of different kinds of stories in the community. Today, when we come to the British presidency, we bring the stories of people, trying to move on. After a better national election week, not in Valuio. So, we don't know what that word means, but this is my whole chance to say it. We've arrived at the 4th of our program at 4. Let's listen together. When the Supreme Court handed down the decision that ended the election, the community went in and day, who's a choreo of commentary. Some of the people who are usually very even who, in calm about the court, get free Rosen, because he needs some new Rosen in the dressing-time, which teaches law, which always watch the universe in the last one. The same thing's on. I don't want to be hyperbolic, but it's safe to say that this is the most outrageous decision that those of us who consider something. moderate, we go Academy of Ever seen. The most temperate scholars are literally a loss for words to try to explain this decision which is so ill-reasoned that it's impossible to view it as anything but to go. Wasn't really the spasm. It's so there was a feeling among those who put this radio shed that we once understood. and exactly what was long existed. And when then we wanted to believe that there is a reasonable place to need for the decision. Thinking and I can ask this too hard. So, this in distance from the decision in this incarnate, we assembled four constitutional actions, two four and two against it. So it's time to figure it out. We have these new actions. A lot of people. Here's a reading. So we'll just... key parts to this system. In the already first set, the recubbing part is violating principles of basic and illegal painting parts. Then sets out of the limit of this law. The pick is one. First, the equal patching. Here's my component. One of the leading conservative constitutional aspects in the equation. The argument is really quite the sumple and sum of sum sum sum sum which is that if there's a B and a state wide recount, it has to be done in any confirms with some kind of objective standard for deciding what counts to vote. The strength court goes into great detail that all the unfairness in the way are a discrete court that is allowing the redeemed home. The unfairness is included in which votes that recanted which didn't, whether people doing the redeemed and are properly trained and fair, whether there was a fair way to challenge himself. The Japanese counted simple charts one way, some counted them another way. The court said, Happy Valentine's Abbott's change within a human, sometimes it's the consent. The Florida Supreme Court's decision was an initial match of standards which almost made it impossible for the European and the European Court of the fact, even people who have big problems in the Supreme Court decision, where there are all sorts of impairments, what is part of the court. Question is whether these impairments are so long, we want to think. the heart accord that actually left the realm normal judicial interpretation. The inside part of our entire, the inside of our shell and the meeting with the Supreme Court called Scarrow and non-judicial act. And then the US people would be, I was not a fan of the Supreme Court's decision. Again, Jackie Rose, the Justice has gone too far, changing accounting standards and imposing a new dub. Even people  me who have pushed us up before. or a significant court can't claim that it was all a sepon the realm of reasonably debate which based on a series of digital precedents that were going back to the early twentieth century. In contrast, as we are saying, the Supreme Court's decision set a few precedents, but they either do not support the case, or sometimes precedents seem to go against the decision simply. Budget impasse, conservatives of the court who said that you have to prove that discrimination is intentional, or it is a real coalition legal package. In data me affirmative action in civil rights cases, that God's great man in the voting rights cases too, that God's great lengths to stress that voting systems could have the inner burden effect of deluding the voter strengths of African-American voters, but we're not intended to disparage after the Republicans are not constitutional violations from service holes again just  you. The mobility, you need intentional speech. No one is claiming here that the different counting standards, whether opposed by the court or by the Florida legislature, cost to intentional speech. So just as I tried to try to one through each method of interpretation, I just can literally allow us to defend this decision. Even though the experts who support this Supreme Court decision, We'll precedent set it up on I'm really similar to that, but I'm really similar to that. Again, who's my friend? I don't need this case. This is a side of the place. The crossings. We've decided to be a pretty common sense of understanding the fairness. That in your point of view, the state wide, three counties, and they seem that first, they have to not all promote this in one. This breaks this. And Drake Austin. Another excuse. I view if most people action. that's the perfect way to get the thing out of the box. There an effort. So, stop that we would reach it. Yeah, that's not a great deal. Only things that society is in unconstruing. There is a... There is a... to a great divide between the support distribution and those with closing. And at one level, the divide is not over the reasoning in the decision. The divided is a bewether or not to see the part of courts' re-key, being per pound look while deeply unfair. They do, they make it bigger than nothing required to justify the very unusual step, the Supreme Court jumping in. They don't, and the logical decision designs. Systems up over and over in the talking two sides. Take to the audience, against. the decision, probably heard news soon. But it said that it was called Test for the Supreme Court to stop the foreign movement on the 52-year-old's. And the point of the movement is to get equal protection for the unfortunate murders, to live the industry to be inferior, less reliable voting for the current current. But it's also said that the U.S. Supreme Court put the part of the court to kind of catch 22-year-olds. Here's how this works. Supreme Court. Foreeeeeeeeeeeere. First told Florida to be careful not to change the rules of the election after election. Don't go in, don't muck around with the law, that will be on constitution. So, Florida court refused to set the state one scene, the counting balance. Because that might be seen as altering law. Then, the Supreme Court spun around and overturned and saying, no, no, no, you should have imposed the state one scene. Any interest dependant, pay me, but these Clerk sources. According to the Equal Protection of the Unlimited, this again, in their view, the bottom armies that were just great problems with the farthest route, farthest court meetings. On our luncheon day, some voters faced worse voting equipment than others, well, this reconciled, in their view, can possibly buy a split in minutes, with few select areas that would be undertaken by war, this game would not make things any clearer. But if the farthest election route was so vague, it was impossible to invent and fare to stay quiet. standard for a week here without changing law and it's better to shut them. And what's the loss? After all, we counting the bias book is no better than not returning off. Again, making some of them. There was good reason not order or return of the law, but if there was fear, we can unobotten the unfair return. The Florida Court of Order or Re-count that was systematically rigged in favor of one candidate was just unjustified. That's me, Juan, to the second part of this conversation. Once the screen court decided, for it, we violated the vocal touch and the microphone. What do they do about it? The conservative legal scholar might be final says that he agrees with what it comes to the attention part of this. That's it. The witness in the opinion. has to do with the issue of remedy that if the problem is the Florida Supreme Court's decision is that it ordered a recount under unfair, unequal arbitrary chaotic standards. The proper remedy would have been descended back to the Florida Court to conduct a recount under fair, consistent, and practice the standards. It would have been better off of the U.S. Supreme Court to leave it up to the state to do that. Normally, when people are being treated on equally the way you treat them equally as you raise everybody up to the fair level. Liberal week lets for 10% stand for loss. So if these doubts could be counted in power, then you count in the Palm Beach instead of the Supreme Court said was, in order to solve the potential inequality, don't count any of these people's hurts. Even though there are large numbers of doubts that weren't counted the first 10 round on which it's absolute fear what the voters intend to. The Supreme Court stopped that process leaving. in a lot of voters as disenfranchised as if they'd never counted closing their schools. Screen-coated course, stopped the party in the same night, then handed down his opinion in the crowd. The opinions said that because it wasn't enough time that we had to do it for everything, they were probably there to stay with them in the situation. When it's the set, just as firepins had been enjoyed and decided that there was no time for a week now, then. any evidence on the court reckoning that we can't be not a being. I'd send a very team to meet  pro college, firemen, or majority fine facts outside of the reckoning. It matters that state courts require better position to address. So what was the majority of the said, the car in the oak and the sea? But the majority doesn't say much about it at all. Does that ??? marking? If something committed to holds the eau và ozanso deatro como Number 2 Ozanso deatro como Number 3 The fire corruption is a deadline conclusion. Big sister thinks that this was not only reason, says it was the most sensitive. First of all, the first Supreme Court had been all along initial condition, always not operating on the assumption that December 12 was the deadline. In the reason they reached that conclusion, the first Supreme Court did was this. There's a federal statute that surprised that if you as a state want to. point of lecture is in a way that they're not subject to challenge by cons, having been improper, they've had to make your selection by 10-12. And the Florida Supreme Court had assumed all along, which legislator of course would have wanted Florida to take advantage of that face harbor position. The center is pointed out that the December Court date is an arbitrary and not far to close the post. So it's less to say Farbie Dan one, than you soak it in boats and hang on. Obviously if you can get it done by the Sun, that's fast, but it's hard to say that Florida would prefer an inaccurate amount on the Sun, 12, to a more accurate amount of 50 or 80, or in a case the Y in 1960 they didn't get the votes until early jam. Presidents can't say of course we can go different establishments, decision, I sort of despair that people will see item items. I'm not why I think that's probably fine. I think this is one of those cases that often one goes out to say in door you can. Only if the very best in matter with discussion is the people that each side will understand. and to be able to set as a reason for it. And you'll apply to the class and people seem to be able to. Well, this was one of those things that brought out some of the worst-in-term parties, but cannot have met after school. People were more passionate, they were, they were. After school. That is so. Do these discussions convince anybody anything? Speaking completely, I think this is a boring meaning of many people who are selected by the majority in this game court. And , I'm not saying I have to say I did not find the arguments in this But you can say now that I see one date, maybe that's it. is it too far and we need to get directly on So good We actually got our deep versions of it now, we're out there. When you say that as a picture, you guys fishing, , just by walking them. That, believe it or not, we did that. We have our Marina and our Peer, we're not familiar. And we did that too. We were going to be all the way up on the Peer. We actually did that. And if we, as my factor, we have many more in somewhere, in some of the fishing rocks and one of the mounds of British there. We used to go to the boat, , maybe it just fell down, we slowed down. It gave us a really thunder side. I mean, it's always super lucky. change such a part of us were in the supermarket in that bank in that area. So I suppose there's probably a lot. Do you have a parent community to be married? something I stuck to see personally in the middle of the book. I'm sure it will be good stuff. Personally, yeah, personally, I'm personally not. Let's keep talking to you. Come on, I'll see you in the next video. in Florida broke all of it, it was 50% of the last business. But over the course of the day, Reverend Harris witnessed some of the problems of things, which led to civil rights movement. This up we set upon place asking voters for ID, some upon officials, from poorer districts, unable to get through the state officials, from firm voter rights movement. There were people who had thrown off the voter rolls because of a faulty list, stated Florida bot, which didn't correctly identify it if for 8,000 people is balanced, was that for winning sports, then life pronto. So, there was, it could feel it. Certainly about the airport traffic, it really feels the same thing. Oh, the front knee, speed and the ball. From close to close, there was just an easy trip. And I left the eyes and the eyes and the eyes and the eyes and the eyes. Because some papers were not done, that's our thought. So, thanks for answering the summary news news. to a state positive net, this entire experience. The year of moments as man watching the and the lecture results in the popular YouTube page, we've got yourself just getting angry or angry at the public. And then you can perhaps know that you didn't play entirely comfortable with this thing. That's actually what I really thought was. Questioning. Spear, start it again. It's a very powerful concept that just gets it all right. Yeah, it's a huge piece of it. Looking at the, looking at the seat. Tell you what Baris, you're not listening to the same testimony. Yes, Baris, you're not reacting to the, , that's what Baris did. You try to ram, ask Baris down and close. No one knows that that great desire in this country is coming. You're not one. is really frightened and passed by the heat of the fire. Then it says to me that you want to be a president of compassion, that you will have to see. But you found it? You can't just have a crack present when you're ready to stay, have you got it? Yes. I'm a friend who was in a smart school, I think he has the same good and solid and powerful. He actually remembered how in 1992, dethrotting and taken on something. Alright. and stood up in the upper heel and referred to as your press. And she says, the cheese doesn't work the tongue. She doesn't want to heat. And she says it's hard not to cook all the way. She's going to throw the eggs. She says, that's the first thing we're going to do. She says, it's the first thing we're going to do. She says, it's the first thing we're going to do. So, we're going to do this. just making this public end. Because, and it was very interesting, of course, it built that the flags that were wrecked were the third flag on one side. So the Jordan flag was, both off and off. That directly over my head was a more than that. So everybody in the room, and it was in turn, of course, and look. And I'm seeing right up on a flag not moving. But something just, I mean, just, just, you get it? And what was it? To be honest with you, the only other time I thought  this would be. I was beating certain things. We were calling what we were. We stopped alone. Because that's some place in the law. This is not my thing. We know we are once. That's the thing. We know that we have we are. We are. And that's we have to pray for it. We must not. this law. So I have to do some of the selfish things. I have to give them. I have to do something. I have to give them. So they need to move on here. How does that come? I love those at the point. I'm sick and tired of this at the time. , sure. That's why I  to eat this. I want to see the prayer. Baby, we're gonna get you. I'm lonely, streep. I keep running towards a dream.
