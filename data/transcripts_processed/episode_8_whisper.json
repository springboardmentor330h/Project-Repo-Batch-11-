We no longer inside 1995. I want to point at that at this point no one in a certain way seems bigger than right. No, not the president. That Michael Jordan, not Courtney and Donna. And I believe that we witnessed the kind of turning point. This past year, when certain mythic pop groups revealed that they're basically just a bunch of aging Delwords without any particular magic to them at all. And I believe that the story, right? The Beatles came out with his big TV documentaries. Rare never before heard outtakes in the studio sessions Well, I hold in my hand. It's one of the rare never before heard artifacts spune forth in the recent deluge It is called is a CD and it's called beetles rare photos and interview CD They put the name CD in in their justification where he whether is this a CD? Yes CD And they've numbered them because it's such a keepsat. This is number 130,862. It's down right around the front. So it's, , click the button. And we'll you decide the rare telling rare photos, which I'm not sure you're the Beatles playing on the acceleration show. According press properties. In the interviews, in interviews the fab for basically come across as exhausted, irritated, they, they, click. battle on in a mundane way or obvious subjects. They are not especially charming or funny and they are no more glamorous really than you or me. They are exactly human scale. They have been rendered in human scale and not one inch bigger. You're going to weigh these Hong Kong suits that you have made. Jill is not having any very cold on long so I've bought you a lot of Chinese suit. It's a stroke too. How much are you paper? It wasn't a very dark, dark, dark, dark.

Take up the old was pretty tough I did it. I mean they give the old rock and roll stuff. I think so yeah a bit more. By the way WB EZ and Chicago this is your radio playhouse. Today you're in the life of one neighborhood and the generation. in the life of one church. The usual stories of this are American life as always. Stay with us. Is this music? Is this a little tip of the most irritating thing we have ever put on to we have to stop it. Mr. T.E.E. have ever done? Well, other radio and television programs have spent much of the last time trying to summarize He has heard, hear music, films, hear and well, dance for politics, give fashion. So somewhere after this, , cheese, snacks, and stuff, and a year in cheese. It was big ear for a book for, I don't even know cheese names. It was big ear for something. And trying to get a sense of ear, I mean, it's big summary, your end story is, it's , type. to get a sense of the United States by flying across the country in Japan and living out of it. You see pretty powers and lots of interesting shapes but the people look things. Well, at this, you already have nightmares. We prefer the image we can go to a little closer for better work. And so now that we have some distance, some objects on the S. five days of complete architecture, even by the quality of parent, to tell us what the year was , one small apartment, and the quality is a high school school, she's 18 years old, and we talked up with her through a community called street level, and usually teenagers come to street for never being let up to make TV deduences and after this banquet and next So this was focused as a gameshow When people are on the country, they should cargo. Most of them do not realize how Mexican is in the sense. But Chicago has more Mexican than any other United States, Central or Central. So for a million people. A little village is the neighborhood that most new Mexican is in the sense of how to use from this name and says it's a place to go. If you really want to stand with me, please . It's 26th. Everyone comes to 26th Street. It's a pretty busy place. There's Lalo, Salos, Gallientes, and a disco mall. There's a parking lot at church to check it with people meet up. The lot the manner and every other corner. Suddenly corn, cucumbers, tamales, Mexican, or fuses . It's a species Michigan Avenue downtown. There's versus bakery. Lalo, halles, cencia, fubric and calos, you'd be a travel If you can see them again. and then music. Go right there magazine on sale here. This big art went into this game with this album. Hock on it, we made it by the Mexican government. Stop working a few weeks after it was in the song. We're also green and white and red lights, arranged in the shape of the Mexican flag. With the green and white ones, we've burned out. That little thing right there is some very many little things. That's when you're entering little buildings. And a lot of gaming is the deal when they pass this thing. the classic shows, , they see them in the sea on the other side. Because of even the place they just say. In the summer, people come to 26th street, cruise around and board. You come here a cruise for a while, short time, see who's around, because of the liquor, and go to the lake. I talked to this girl on the record store about why girls come down and she's proof. You take out the guy and he's , it's , it's , it's , it's , it's sad because they're gaming, but they're the finest. , , , , you really socialize or hang around with them. And it's , just , get this tingling in this side. You can't pass on 26th Street without noticing rasa brothers. They have beautiful furniture, and this is a stuff people are enabling with one supply. But people with money and the people with a... Whatever you've heard about the terrible shape of the nation's retailer economy, 26th Street Street Street in Parn. Go into the chamber. commerce in the United States. In 1995, the number of stories in the neighborhood actually increased 1% salesmen of lossybrette's health business. This is the most successful year we've been here 40 years. So, why business is better? I don't know. A father's a retired and a younger . There's a definite transformation in the area. All the properties becoming worse while all the empty v... They can watch their putting new houses, their new construction. So I mean this is becoming a vital part of the city. Over at the Dismiss Town, some stories had a good game for some. This town mall is probably 40 or 50 stores packed into an old department store, then. Now I don't know, I also think stack way over your head. Spanish music, the version of Guadalupe, I think. She was on T-shirts and framed pictures. She was on a car. by tiny power dweights. Other stores basically sell the same things, things from a Mexico, from a lay,  the band Davis suits, Joel O'Sherds. Danna Ha is one of the leather stores, three girls were just sitting there eating Chinese food. One of them said, the most affordable thing that happened to her this year was a sell to someone who's Polish. And then when they look most polapses. Usually she said, the policy comes from her store, look, they don't buy. They worry that the Mexican merchants. they're giving the best price. The merchants, they see their cost from different ones. For locals they have an annuals. Look at it, complex. The Kanye's, she's saying that she. Over the years so many Mexicans have done well and she's about the lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood, suburbs. This woman said 80% of the asking this is here for Mexicans to move to the suburbs, but you come back here to shop. They don't forget when they come from. In the hallway we found this man from the suburbs. He says he comes here to get out what the Mexicans wear. He says it feels  you're in Mexico here. He comes here to see the pyshanos. He came here with his friends so they could get to know little village. Over near the pet store, the staff of CJ's clothing is almost auto-nagers. One boy is 17, originally from Mexico, from Ichakan. He works but doesn't go to school. This year he met his girl in Mexico who left in Chicago. He liked her and followed her over here. Eventually it didn't work. But he stayed here and now he is making money to help out his family. Was she in the delivery? He says he misses his family in Mexico, but if he was there, he says he just be doing drugs instead of making money to help his family. His little cousin Ricardo is interpreting. He translates everything. Ricardo had a couple of exciting moments in 1999,  when he helped the police at the deep in his calm home. around, watch videos on the story TV, when Ricardo told them that a lady is stealing one of this club thing to use to protect him. But overall, Ricardo signed up 1995 in one word. There's no boring story. Why has he been boring? My brother, he bored you. He, when he goes to places he doesn't take me anywhere. How about you? How about he doesn't take me with him? He's older. I'm nine and he's 15. But when he was 13, he would take you with him, was there a time when he would take you all his life? No, no, no. We know where. Miguel is a self-personist, and I saw him. I knew for sure that he was big English. I could just tell. He's 19, has to go to his tall, mini complexion. I asked him how his year was. This is when my best year was. Maybe we're meeting some more girls for this afternoon. It's about it. Yeah, it was 1996. Maybe we could call some girl that. Right now, not name friend. She knows, yeah, that you're gonna go. Yeah? She knows. And this is when it's first day can happen. When her father gets her out. How old are you? She's  18, 17. She says that I guess she can't spend the strict facts. We talked to Miguel for a while. In 1996, a graduate. and divide someone  chronic patients. It doesn't matter. It doesn't  trouble in the street. And before wrong, he has Claudia for a phone number. Yeah. We're talking about two languages. When you're famous, I'll be famous, which is... Alright. Let's give him... This is my favorite one. I told him I wanted to be a fashion designer and a writer someday. And he said... Okay, he's a writer, book about my adult. About me, though, right? We headed over to the Cosmetics Town in it appeared to this car responded that Miguel wanted Cardi his phone number for a date. I think he was just running for a business. He is definitely calling her. Oh I don't know. See because. Next we went to Los Comales. It's open 24 hours. It's a place where everyone goes when they get a hundred attack. I'll just. by as well on one in the morning they have good tortas the best tortas I want tortas for many more hours come on a diet I'll just drink and equality fresca instead of tortas it's a noisy friendly place with great orange boots allowed to eat class and the blender is going nearly non-stop making me quados I when table was a guy with short hair and a big black one went to de-dice check sitting with his girlfriend he had a bad year and been good it's all expensive because I lied to my application. Because when I actually have a big convicted of felonies, I know that I have no way. Wait a second. Yeah. It was because somebody wanted to the office and they kind of hold on to the song. Sorry. Why did you get fired? I didn't see anything that. Besides the new job that you want to ever forget. I have a piece here. This is it? I just got out of jail. What? Just  I did. you'll help you in any way being in jail  the street in your head. Who's quiet for a second? Let's go find sugarhead now. Did it help you? He's still stubborn. Right. The hit-up that jail lane for you, get straight, it makes a worse. You've put it in the front of the 66. I'm a... I still got my cases planned. It goes to the one of her friends, also had a pretty bad year. Private was that she was going to Mexico to go visit her grandfather. for the first time and she received a call from some relatives informing her that her grandfather had been killed. She said it will always stay with her deep down inside because she never got the chance to meet her grandpa. But she said this year has made her even strong. Now she knows that she... He has to stay in school and continue her education. Now she's working. She says she's learned you got a fight for what you wanted this night. She knows that it's not going to fall from the sky. The climate, I guess it's pretty, it's low. It's a lot lower. The first one is sister to merchants. There's not that much. There's no rush. There's highly any robberies or very few thefts. The gang's socialization that's being curved. We can't see with the policeman. who patrol 26th Street, standing at a graphic design office. He said the community policing is one of the main reasons primaries going down here. Now people are more willing to sign complaints and put it. It used to be that way. When I asked his cop to tell us about the most dramatic thing that happened to him this year, his partner said, what about that jewelry store a rabbit? Well that's the that's the that's the traumatic. I've seen the I've seen rabbit reasons as it was just a corabory. As far as I mean, they can be dramatic to somebody else. But to me I sit in every day, I sit in every day, I'm sorry. So it's a phase meeting more. First of all, people can chat and kill or... It doesn't... I'm used to it. But something did happen to him that was more dramatic than a robbery or a shooting. Just dramatically, but a brand new home. , well, that's not your man. But it has my dreams to have. I'm all hell. I never had a house. I was living in apartments. It's nice. But yeah, I guess I had work in. It's in a South West Asia category and it's a split little home,  a suburban type home, it's a nice home, , side drives, floor bedrooms, so when I have pegrage, , expensive, , I have what a fun, let police officers fence it, don't so I guess that's what made me 5 The father stories you hear of that hot terrible life is, or if you just enable this. One of the most striking things that are on 6th, is how many people noticed it had a really good year. We met this young couple who had a baby and a two-year-old daughter. I asked back her interview the husband because he was a one-care in the baby. So it turns around and asked his wife if it was okay with him. And she said yes. I just totally fell in love with that. When we asked him what was so good about this past year. He said everything my daughter's been growing happily in Nice and healthy too. You healthy It's very growing and we've been nice. We got nice blessing this Well, I we've been together for long time. We already been more together in four years and we Don't people they say they don't last you'm cop was all you really been last since together So let's be a memorable He's 22 and she's 21 Mario and love these from Euras any parents some of their biggest events in 1995 about kids. For example. But backwards she says that's your key. But a little backwards she says he just come out. It's bad. I want to say it. Oh yes, three. Yes three, right? It's a backward. And also we're all sitting down, , and I'm. Talked that much in other words, and she just came out. She got mad, I mean, taught me a real bad word. So she's going, , and there you want to start a life. So. You're a serious. She's just about to turn three and this happened at Christmas dinner. , my sick and families are big. They were all there and they are laughed When we asked about 96, various said next year was going to be nicer. Every year we'd be nice, we said. He held a baby, his wife took her to a young daughter's house. and they walked away, down 266, in the snow. Claudia, we should explain what music this is. Once the tape with bottom of this card mark. It's hard strikes, I think kids. It's  it's in the past, it looks  the cereal box, tricks up here is good plenty. It makes tape, sign here is just giving the taste of what, but at the end of the south side and then we will else listen to him. It doesn't this music sound more vital or alive than the certain music of a certain group of aging baby born and 60s era. You, you, you, you, you, you, you. You can watch. Leave this love. All you need is love. Turn it off. You wake up and you're just to recognize yourself again. Yeah. I think I'll be waiting more. Yeah. You need this love. You need this love. Do any of them on a church? You want to buy anything in Australia? Yes, definitely. Anything  what? Do you have the heavy heat? Of course. Do you have a good appetite because you can't get above the noise for people's equipment to share? No. You made an interesting American girl? Not yet. What do you mean? think of the police protecting you've been receiving here in the city as well as are the crowd as large as you expected now well my business business business this next story and finally get it on it it's a story that I began over a year ago making about many many other He actually developed higher church and for ten months I have not been here to walk down fifty-six. Now, looking over my shoulder here that I'm going to run into one of these people because I have not been to the story. But now, proud to say, story it is here. This is here. This is here. This is here. I said, this is what is it here and I will be set free. This story doesn't about this higher church. Story. and we'll get to that part. But first you have to talk about how it is because it begins to be said. And Karen HUD is normally the director of religious education that is the first unitarian church of Chicago. And one Sunday morning, a while back, I'll open. When the senior minister was planned, Karen HUD did a guest. Did you talk about the very unusual experience that she asked? Karen Hutt is the first black child in the kindergarten to the adult age. And so, first of all, I'm going to set our minds back with our people, and I'm going to talk about what went right, what went wrong. And what happened is her family moved to a white Jewish and she wrote a book of school. Part of the experiment about three black families and lots of goodwill and exciting about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein. I realized that it wasn't really talking about clips. It was probably about YouTube's career. Did you feel  you were getting? Did you feel  you were able to have a new man? Well, I know very beginning when we moved to sleep, which I was really resisted. It was all my friends. The other day, I opened, and that the new neighborhood was something for my father. I was so excited to tell his friends about my hair on the phone and talking to his friends. Yeah man, the only one's out here. I listened to him  the only one's out there. What was this all about? So, it's a theory for my parents to be with me, to be a big house, a lot of pasty, and huge, and all of this for me. But for me, I did feel  he'd experiment with his people. And maybe we'll stop him smiling at me. and say they're glad that I'm there and do all these kinds of things even sometimes we don't have any to make these things. We're some kind of problems. That all maybe always feel a little uncomfortable because I did never get comfortable. I could never trust that it was going to be real because soon as I would had a perfect food � Execution and done chemicals again. Measure C are there? some of these sounds. But all of us sort of change the numbers. That's what it's interesting to help you. The numbers have to be for to change how many African American farmers have moved in for the total American change. Well, it's maybe 50%. What was the research? Integration for a lot of white people I found to be  one black thirst. anya k mi surface But for African Americans, we  the idea of 50-50. That's the reason. So when it got to 50-50, in the case, you can see the staff. It was so strong. Because it was white split. And we had to also realize that the real estate is just a lot to be speaking to people. So people can be talking about. But the thing I found curious is that all the blacks including them are about much more material well and better jobs. I hope those who were on the guarantee of 50-50. So if we were to our family, we could have to send the judges and boys and the doctors. We found some theories. Yeah. They did one live with us. We knew it wasn't it now. Did you give a great event for the institution? Yeah, I was very happy. So now I'll move to our... So... Do you give a sign from our ... on smoke? I was angry about losing time to be living. Did you feel used? I thought you used me to wait in my car and talk to issues. I played a song because in the beginning it was black. It was the school. These people from the church were from the church. I think that would be a bit of a... because we have realized to our parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society. Absolutely, we were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they want to realize in whatever way they do. So I don't think I could even look back and find thought, many of their choices and say basically if they're part of it, they're all of those times. So Karen, hi. search about the good things in the band and her experience situation. And the reaction she got from the congregation at the first meeting to the church, the sort of surprised coming up, the reaction and their stories which you're ready to get up. It's your ready to apply house to my regular class. So after Karen Hut gave us some bad her experience as first black child in the great show about the public schools. Lots of members of the congregation, cleaned her. said, well, I was the first black person in this neighborhood. I was the first African American integrate this girl's death, or I was the first African American in this apartment at the first years of Chicago. And Karen had came to believe that for middle class blacks, the story of the last 30 years is the story that begins with the sentence. I was the first black people. And so many stories from the first unitarianism in the division. and was a hotbed of political activism in the 60s, the 70s, hid black campers, old man delegates, red squad, red upset church and cars. And lots of people with first humanitarian church had been involved in various integration struggles. And after Karen Hut's sermon, they talked about doing an oral history of their experiences with integration. But they had gone around to it. And so we went them to take a few years to it. and we asked them to do the oral history for our program. Karen had to be an artist with a young woman, a barf, and then. And Laura had the opposite experience, parent had such an opportunity. Maybe it's the same experience. This is the opposite experience. It was exactly the same experience. For much of her childhood, Laura's family was one of the few white families, and the South Shore and the South Shore. And by the time she was in... eighth grade , she was one of two white children. And she describes it as just as she describes it as just as a confusing time. She describes it as just confusing time. You do the grammar of acceptance. She says it was just as confusing for her as it was for her and can cry. And sometimes she wished she would cry so she could fit in better. It really created a lot of questions of who she was. and how to get on with it. The violence in the Navy had started to increase somewhat. We had been robbed at gun point and it was a kind of terrifying experience for me. And we would ask about family. Are we going to move in there? So, well, yeah, maybe we'll move. The feeling that was conveyed was what it would be. move, then we are, we'll be training this ideal of integration. And so at the time, I felt that, well, what is that ideal and why are we here when I don't feel comfortable here all the time? Although, I think I'm, I know the level is that that idea that we will be training on the integration is also just an excuse for other person's reasons for why it was common in receiving, I really focus on public application with empowering, present through the project, fear of my own changes... is collecting. One of the interesting things in the material that I do before I can move on is that is that, generally, when we hear stories about being the first person who's created a school or a neighborhood or a job situation, we're used to hearing horror stories, but in your interviews with members of the church, one of the things that's striking is how often people tell you about moments and times where things worked out okay, and many people told you stories about somebody when science-ethnic where it sounds  there's no었어 or something that's unexpected that also exists how do you feel that what you're trying to do where you feel that you are ... What else do you get? yeah whatever You want me to help your hands at school? yes a boss or coworker or teacher or friends and cook out for them, help get in jobs and appointments, help them find housing and otherwise exclusive neighborhood that that was coming to Blacks out. I'm going to make a video to talk about some of these things. Okay, one of the people that I interviewed is a gentleman named Jim Jennifer, who's in his late 60s now, and he was in the AFRIL, the subsidiary. and towns, instead working from the opportunity in the other countries. Race was not really a real concern because we all went tenduptive, we were all parallel, playing around with each other, and all that we were always doing, and working with. The interesting part about talking the rich of was that I learned, he's employed to work too pretty, great lengths to ensure that he was able to. to perform his job without the usual racial barriers, including music and music in the world. I was beginning to travel quite a bit and beginning to fly quite a bit. And somehow I where it came up one day that question has asked me, Bicty, were you aware of the fact that there's been an actual lives that went ahead of you to make sure to clear the road so that the new world came to the hotel to whatever. where they was more racial things involved and so that absolutely not this wasn't something I was in era. This next interview was with Tim Lee Campbell, who's a professor at the Riding University and activist in the professor's labor party and very active in the social justice environment I'll just just move and not church. This is some right-acting, it's the gold way back. Also was a sharp MTB Need to say that from 1972. I think about my experience with integration border, bunch of them. But the one that really sticks out is with my e-nubbrett, boil rabbit with a Kentucky white brother named Junior Osborn and his white rose Mary. We're in this little town of Carpenter, Lindiang, and I am the part and expression of black leader of the white folks, because no one else wanted to reach out to the red mix on the red mix. And there's no story ahead there. But now I'm even thinner with Gina Osborne, his wife, Robes Mary, and he's going off the steed rabbit. It is so good. It is so delicious. Listen to that E.D. and talking and talking about food stamps, program, things  that. And here's this guy who's equipped in my nightmare. The midnight, draw and look in class, white man, with his white wife. And I'm sitting there, the radical, supportive black kind of part of all that stuff. We're sure. this rabbit and it is so good. And I said, how you learn how to cook, rabbit, backstab, and he said, on your main black spow, then the way we fight false always cook it, then it don't know me that there's a sudden unity. There was always a form of cultural integration in the song, in which law acted as the law, people's divide, not personal, desire, and personal experience. not all, but from then on. So that really stuck out in my mind. Having that rabbit with junior eyes more, and that turned me completely away from any black ears in my knee of head about white folks are not capable of making change. But let's get to some of the tougher experiences that has racial pre-nears. Well Alex points out. Remember if I are church, a long standing member of my church, you want to see your staff at it. in magazine to write her. He grew up in England in the 20s and 30s. His first experience with integration was in high school. He says among the people he knew, it was no real mixing, blacks were just ignore. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college. The University of Illinois in Shepa was  North Mississippi. In my own case, I was obliged to sit in a class. The only black in a particular classroom, and had to tolerate a professor telling a nigger in the wood politics, , and that realizing that while there is a black person here who might be offended by that, . And after that particular session, I recall, evidently, he had realized that he had to get rid of the full palm and try to be a part of the apologetic and so forth. I just simply walked away from him. I'm another ... , there's something to talk to you as some show it back and she was also , I can't really understand the same time, , how it came to me. People thought, , that anybody who really was straight, were black people, was a town, they were counting this or something. They were not people who were really looking for them. The black son? Yeah. Well, that's the way it was because the regular, I mean, things were not. You couldn't actually, when I went to Illinois, you couldn't live in the dorms. And at Chicago, you could. She could go live in the Bronx. People used to call this a country school on the most innocent. No, I always talk about the country, the reds, and they want to have it at Chicago. One of the other people that we talked about in the South Home, too. She came to the church in the Sunday school teacher, but she ended up as the first black man in the Christian teacher. So she wanted me. I said to my mom and dad. Hey, I'm joining the church, which you come and be with me. So I came over and as I say, I ran in, raised my hand, was accepted, unknown to me on that day, the president of the board went to my club and he had this conversation with him stating that, oh well, it's all right. the people who come are  their daughter. And what did he mean by  your daughter? What was that I was a colleague? OK, I'm assuming that since it was not told to me for several years later, my father was quite heard. And knew that I was so enthusiastic about this church. Had I known that I would have been disillusioned at a time when I was just forming an opinion of what was truth, what was reality. in all of us. I'm sure that he was indicating that okay these are middle class flags. They own their own home. The this girl is in college. She's going to be a professional. Whatever it meant. Soon that faction left the church. Alex points that join the church after Pauline II. But one of the things that real collection. is that even though this pro-white faction left the terms of getting really make that much of a difference? It makes pretty good purchase here. Although I think many of the whites even in those early days, many of the ones, my wife fellow fellow church members were constantly on pins and needles, fearful of on one hand, big offensive to me, are being so naive in their relationship with me. as to inadvertently offend me. And the striking thing about that experience was that there was no concerted effort on the part of the church to integrate in quotes, the liturgie. Whatever black spirituality you brought to the church, you parked outside the door. You'd be bringing inside the door. I mean, if you were into the hand clapping and I'll ask you. shouting and all that you let that partner door because you would be an ambassador you see. So that's one way in the Russian. That's sort of sort of in the Russian says, you get  me and whatever it is that is unique to you, you leave that in high. That's cultural suicide. When civil rights began to be a back to the people who came to think about it. There was a real effort to do things in comfort. This is George Reed, who was somebody that I interviewed at Ling. He was a chemist professionally. His experience was interesting because he noted that in the beginning of the civil rights movement, there were a lot of goodwill gestures on. the part of whites and I think she felt that was good thing but I think soon thereafter and I'm over of a course of the years those good world gestures began to diminish. We were invited in no mobile homes events whatnot and some of which I hated for because I always got lost. I just, , I this automatic goes in a long way no matter how clear the directions are and I always got lost. But the people are wonderful and we have wonderful experience and we develop some very good friendships. And then I saw  a flash in the pan and saw the sort of thing kind of faded away. I don't know. Now, whether it's due to the motion, see if the blacks are aware of the packet, the whites decide, , there's much trouble to keep trying to do all this happening. We're reaching out, saying, they have nothing to do. , you need to do it. , I'm basically checking why not. I don't know what, but I'm quite mind, but I think in black, I'm probably ready to do this. I guess that's where I can describe it is the way it is. There was a sorrow meeting here at the church. And we were all down there and they had this person who is next for it. And I'm going to explain the gathering then to talk to you. and buzz groups. And this isn't around the mouth. I don't remember that. But that was really upset. And I thought he saw the camera there, adding to the many voice to the song. He saw the problem. He saw the problem. He saw the problem. He even all walk out here. Why? Didn't even know it was around. We've all walked out here and we can't change so. So I think something will happen that Black Sea Sea Sea and look, no more of this conversation stuff. Are you sure to just kind of living history if you've tried this accommodation stuff? This can be interesting. These people, there are a lot of people that really try to integration work in their lives and get... the ongoing public debate across the country about how to integrate whether to integrate, whether it accomplishes anything. Well, what it means you ask your church members was, do they think it's worth it? Do they, do they feel hopeful about integration? Do they think it's worth trying to do, given their experience? Well, this is finally Campbell. They said earlier he's in activist and then he's been involved in issues in South and the North. And he's  a chef. Integration never has been given a chance to really get off the ground. Remember we got our last integration bill in 65 and then 66 to Black Power movement hit on the one end, then Nixon hit in 60 on the other end and then there's a white skin privilege and there's that and the other popped up. So we can no longer talk about a mass integration process. It was short circuit it would be trading luck. So we got it all about integration moments and I am not only have I seen. them and experience. They feel me with hope. Now what do you say to people who think that integration happens and now we need to move into more segregated separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? That seems  a growing movement in commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that? Well I say that many of those people never really experienced true down-home segregation. Another top Afro-centric movement. person who came out with a niche, but actually weird and a small town in Minnesota. So of course, with that kind of experience, we've only black, being very round bear with some blacks. You're going to feel  my god, let me get his black as I can. But the full service came up through the old southern days with the black churches, black conventions, black schools. We know what that's  and we're so okay now we're ready for the next floor. Here's George Weedigan. I don't think so. There is the salt commitment in the likeness to his advice early on to try to resolve. I think maybe many people  me are running scared themselves. They want to survive. And why is it growing up in the society that condoms the kitchen? And those even might seem elaborate on that. They still have that baggage. They have a carry that says that maybe not up to it or they're not preserving them. This is how this can does belong to them  the ones that are underneath. Yes. something so subtle and verbatious that it's disdumpteched probably even with the best entomptious. I feel that aeration is to hurt. This next tape is from John Rice. He came to the church I think in the 70s. So I've been thinking. Tobleye was hiding out of this black panther at the time and am Luckily on them so. See how I changed my shapes and bent. involved in activities there and spend their ever since. He said that he found that closest thing to real integrations in our church, in the outside world, he says there's a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black. And I had people from both communities when we know your black ones, when we know your black ones, when we know your negative ones. Theitarian Society gave me that freedom. I can be I can be the asshole man What's the beat? Nobody says that's a black asshole. We'll just say that's John. He's who he is. One of the things I think that's made People in Austria, the O's of integration has worked is that people have substantial authentic relations I I think that's of really taking the set is been on long haul They're just still there, they're still there, shot with the still. All these folks are still around struggling with musicians. Maybe not talking about them the same tone, but they're still part of building a community. And I think that's the dream that still alive for many people because of that church. But I think the authenticity of relationships means that certain things have work for them. Yeah, you're insisting on it. Yeah, and I wanted to say I think that that is what sort of dream is. me to the church in the evening. I came to the church at a point where I thought, I live in two different worlds still and it's driving crazy. I live on the north side and I grew up on the south side on a swear to God, there's still two different cities. And for me I needed to reconcile that. And when I came to first genitarian and I saw that people were still struggling with these issues, I thought, okay, I haven't lost my mind. People are still struggling with this and maybe  George talks about the burden that he felt that he thought that whiteston share and And yet I think that in some small way I feel that burden too because I don't want to live in a world where We can only live in harmony with the separately. It just doesn't feel right We're laughing again, Karen Pot, the first one is in church, you should have the painting finished. Thank you, thank you, I'm so excited. I don't want to lie, I don't have a butt, I don't want a lie, Loading out of them, I'm a boy, I don't want a lie, Loading out, I'm a butt, don't have no no, that I'm a guy,  that I'm a dick, that I'm a dad, you man, Sit on the butt,  that I'm a dad, You get to the conclusion, yeah! It's good. But earlier in our program. We heard a story by Claudia Perez about the year on 26th Street. And we thought that we would end our program with her as well. In reviewing what the year was  in her neighborhood, just to talk about what the year was  in her own life. And she said that her family is actually in a sad, so it's a pleasant, whoever the world from shot, last November, which didn't talk more about that later. And this September, she said she had a kind of turning point in the right. She's eight and she goes to an opportunity. high school court, or a quarter of a million. And the funding was threatened and we're going to have the problems. And her teacher said that she's instrumental in sitting in convincing the city colleges board of directors to reinstate the funding. She spoke before them. And according to I went and says she captivated them with the way she spoke and they did decide to give the money to school up and to give you a sense of the kind of person who she is becoming. Now she decided to hear school should put out a newspaper and so she put one out. She wanted to interview Louise Rodriguez with poet and author and she did interview him which is from her was a big thing. And when she and I were going around the discount mall interviewing people for her story, she was constantly giving advice to people especially to the other teenagers which appear at the situations in a rudder-ster example. She got into a big discussion two different actually about how to get a college. If you have any good kind of occasion  doing anything  if you could follow your scholarship they help me try to get a savings ban from listening for a lot and something and they give you a list of 100 dollars but that's good  anything will help you try to write assays or  poems anything and just instrument to kind  something you get a lot of scholarships which is entering it especially for your extended and latin man what's your name? it's because  if when you go to regular high school then I'm gonna tell you that they don't want you to succeed instead they don't want you to succeed so so when she was in our studio we talked about about her year and for the sake of so how's your year? yeah? open down basically down look at that Isn't here, he was in here, Christmas. All things been, , He thought, Christmas, Dispersions, I'm small and I was didn't take to be home soon. Good news. Christmas. So what else happened in the house? Well, Oh,見 Christmas from the Vormov in the running past. and then I find this guy came and was I've liked it for a long time. It's probably, it's gonna be four years. And I see them, and Christmas Eve, it was good, it was nice. It was, I had it, I haven't seen them for a long time. Three months ago. So you liked them for a long time? I haven't been seeing it. You haven't been going out. No, no, no. And I see them and I was happy. , I thought, oh, okay, nice. That was to me, that was a good person. ? Just to see. Yeah. And then two days later, I see my tomorrow with another girl. And I guess to me, that was a sign of to finally let go, . And I wanted to cry. But it was just , there was no more tears. , I've learned to keep it clean. , be in that downbomb. I thought I think about him. But it's not gonna be , he caused me, I didn't jump to him. I know it's not for all of you. You can wait more. Maybe. It's lunch. Come on. Three, it's gonna be for you. And after that time, you would see that no name. But every now and then, I have my voice, I don't have his girlfriend's but we still talk. So, this is for you. So me that's a great achievement and I'm finally someone because he got his I can I say I've stopped a lot of things for I could have been somewhere else is it here? I mean looking some men Did you? But I didn't I was about what he was at or he was story So what do you mean? And now I'm just... Yeah, you can watch. You can now you've brought in a story, you've brought in a CD, what is this?
