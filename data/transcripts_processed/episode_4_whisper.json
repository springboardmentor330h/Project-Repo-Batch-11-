And it's  watching the word enter their brain and they're  the sense they're thinking part of them goes away and their eyes start to glaze and then as eat in a dream a scene from the mentoring and candidate. They say the one? Welcome to the B&C Chicago, it's American Life, where we're going to go out. Each week of course we choose a theme and invite you to write a promise to tackle that theme. It is program, name, or vacation, stories by San Francisco and they're in this question. The American family can't get along and paradise. What up is there? The one right to move, actually. and you can go home and see all the comments that when he was there, you used to know. So I was going to go, I hear a real tusk neck on the jet open on the jet open. I hear a real whysack, but I don't  the way I hold it, but I don't know what we want to do. Say me back to calm, and then it's man-op-thing, so I just see you. You're just a little whine, I'm almost a little more. I'll go back to my fishing call. I  that too, I love that too. Can you hear how I'm eating? I don't know if I'm an executive law for all those things. So my sister's in defuse, my aunt, California, my parents find in East Coast, actually, nearly more in the plain from her hair. I went mainly because I wanted to spend some time with my parents. My dad was a star of the hospital, and he had emergency surgery. He didn't die. And I wanted to hang out. ? Try to get along better, feel closer, which you might not know as many as I am in any, is not so easy. I brought the pictures of my trip to show you. This one, this is the condo we stayed in. You can see palm trees, the windows, it's my turn on couch, diet, throat, good morning America, which I can list the clattering vapid noise of Satan is on the telephone. But that's my parents' life and I wanted to do what they wanted to do. My parents' life was not a romantic place of ramshackle bungalows and beaches led by torchlight. The fact it was a scrubbing looking condo with over-stuffed pastel furniture and pastel photo art prints for you while in the crime show. We've got two sports and it's working in the mall and the first one. In short, this was the least excited. We'll set it. But when we ride my mom, got out of car, we're in parking lot and we're in some parks. And she said one. Parents. This picture, this is my dad making cereal and condo. My parents brought their favorite breakfast cereals with them in 1000 miles from wine. They  them, they're from my comforts of home,  in the gym. In fact, in all sorts of stressful situations, I realized on this trip, I hadn't actually quite put together. I realized on this trip that in all sorts of stressful situations, what my parents do is that they parents do is that they make themselves comfortable by focusing on creating a comfortable personal space. When my sisters and I moved away to college my parents, comforted themselves by building a house. When my mom got breast cancer, five years ago, they decided to start a major rehab on a house. And in why, with the stress having to deal with children, grandchildren, they spent a lot of time obsessing on the condo, and what they saw as its many shortcomings. The sliding glass doors weren't that heavy, nice kind, I'm on fire. The bathroom's, thousand floors didn't have quality, then my mother didn't prefer. And rather than spend more time with her family, which was, , the point of the location, she would vanish, for hours at the time, she'd actually  the whole afternoon, mom, , where she'd be and she would be now, , checking out other condos, and hotel accommodations. And there. This is me snarkling. I won't point out to everybody that's renting a snarkling equipment. And we all went on, we don't want to do some coves where they say it's really nice. And when we got there, I cannot get anybody to come in the water with me. It turned out that none of the things that you would expect that people would actually want to do and why with things that that my parents, especially willing. They don't  the ocean or the sun. They want to go to look at volcanoes, they don't want to see cool redance, they don't want to drink, , to the tropical drinks from Bravillars and them. My sister said, I can even talk them into staying up late and playing crunch with us. , I just, it begs to question the central problem, the problem of the family vacation. What can people do? That way. make them feel close. The activities offered by the license, so he named comparison to the mountain that the average family presents. I've had 20 minutes of this picture taken I got out of water and we all kind of went up and I said, okay, so the day my mom went up to the condos again. And I just did not want to go with it.

And for some people that's happy. And for others it's hell. I bring this up because I think paradise shares this quality in the end. Some people. of the occasion paradise is paradise. But for others, I must eat some. It's very nice to go traveling to Paris, London, and Rome. It's also nice to go traveling, but it's so much nicer, yes, it's so much nicer, no. It's very nice to just wander the camel route to Iraq. Oh so nice, you just wonder, but it's so much nice, so yes, it's also nice to wonder back. The man sells and fry a line and the senior readers are sweet. But they can't compete because they just don't have what the models have on matters in them. It's very nice to be footloos with just a toothbrush and co-mits. Oh so nice to be footloos, but your heart starts singing when you're over swinging across the pole. And you don't really know. Actu.

Sanjutsing those are writer-performer composers, she's a columnist for Buzz magazine Los Angeles. This story is from her one woman show, aliens and America which is largely about her mother.

Where is the Etchip? I followed by contrast with fascinated with Uruguay. Why? You had a friend there we could stay with for free. But it was more than that. The people of Uruguay are there, They're inseparable and hard work. The agrarian farm workers face Sassinating challenge. Come by technological hurdles that they Block, block, block, block, block. You might wonder how such opposite people's right parents. got together in the first play. I blame it on viewing. And my mother first saw my father in the mid 50s. He was sitting behind the wheel of a shiny new 50s-60. I guess a man looks better than he ought in a view of, especially when it's surrounded by southern California in the 50s. The palm friends, swimming pool, dotted you, top you, looked by a sun so bright, you actually start to hallucinate. You believe you are in fact quite similar to a person. After all, what? Both of you are new immigrants recently escaped from bad circumstances in your home countries. I thought it was orphaned by age 12 in Shanghai, lived in poverty. I'm other went through World War II, ran from soldiers, heard bombs drop around here. Of course, my mother hated stories of such grim, Zola-esque realism. We're favored after dinner stories, we're either goofier or schmolty, ending hopefully with a glass of peach-nops and a single lot of some kind. When American friends at dinner parties asked her about hardship and done. Well, we're two Polish occupation, she cut them off and passed. But enough of me. We are all of us travelers, next time. Or in people and for me. And we all of us miss her. Let us see. Similarly, number two between my parents, nothing. Except, I guess, that both had come to America, place where miserable yesterdays could be traded in for joyous visions of tomorrow. And why not? It was the sixties, a great time for America. Jackie O. was in the White House, a polaroid it's when the sky. The future was made flesh at eye popping worlds fares, featuring water rails above, below. billions of happy dancing through world people, joining hands and singing. It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all. So what if my parents had nothing in common? Never mind. My mother would make this work. In 1969, after many disagreements, she had learned to be cracked. She dropped the idea of Hawaii, both Lord or Disneyland. While she was suggesting was for day 2. to Malawa, who was the rest. Just laying a little known remote part of Ethiopia. It was the last adventure my parents would ever agree on. East, Ethiopia? My father, of course, had been immediately interested. And why not? Ethiopia was notoriously backward, wretched poor. That time too, they were recovering from some sort of bloody civil war, leaving its countryside bleak, its people's desperate. When in the world would want to go on vacation in Ethiopia. them, which my father saw could be turned to our advantage. After all, my father asked, if no one else is going, see how far the American dollar will go. He thinks of vacation to cost one American dollar, Caitlin and I, pled with my mom. He's cheap and mean. We were on to him, even then. He just doesn't want to stand any fun. Please mom, we don't want it. She asked, who exactly did an ouviage over?

Actually, if it's all right here in my planet right at the highest book, the father does not know it yet. Probably quite a bit. But, once we get there, we will run away from your father and swim on the beach. Swing on it. It's pound of wood, my mother would subscribe. anything is too wonderful to be possible. There's what would never come to mind. So, Iman, who wants you? There be fear fear was not good, there might. Applinging for our ride on a shuttering gray plane brought us to a town suspiciously gay name of okay... Your name isinch. L sized off around the car and Sination listing!

The hotel, Lolli Bella, seemed made entirely of heat, and heat, which took its kitchen beaded through the desert wind for long time. The quailum carpets were potted as symbols on the runway, so it was made to face now. Keep linen eye were given the sour glasses of lemonade to drink to some perched off the sunglasses, watching Scrunch, heat grey's up to each. all at once. She screamed and scattered, a man in a gullabella was running out of them with an ass. I turned from this weird spectacle to contemplate yet another. There stood my mother with four German tourists, large, blonde, greening their sweat-street catty, expensive cameras and a luch was leather-tappled bag strapped around them  fresh kill. Apparently there was no place in Africa so miserable some German tourists did not want to see it. rude The visit on a Deutsche- My mother cried out, raising her hands and pouring, I beat. And then all five adults fell into a group hug. It was laughter, siren, no rapid German exchange. One done sick was the startled query, and that it nodded. Ah, yaaah, yaaah! So they all originally hailed for my mother's hometown. Photos were coming out of Persues and bags, Now chocolate, smells, where they had gone, Where they were going, and now here's where the... Lawa Pearl of the Red Sea Magic really clicked in. Incredible coincidence, Bill's son, Franz Joseph, and the Fat Couple were headed to Lawa Pearl of the Red Sea. It would be a party, maybe Caitlin and I would even get to swim on the beach. With a wave of my mother's hand, whole group sat down to surprisingly festive Ethiopian dinner bread and peas, tatas, and of course, Freshmont and the Caitlin and I had watched the Blitz last place of graph. just hours earlier. The adult buzz was growing to overwork. It was much slapping of thighs lifting a glass. Even my father was having fun. Plentyos of adjusting ants used to picking up the dinner tab. Do for ripped in, Deutsche, my father gafad and his terrible German reaching over at Lucy and Wilson on the rear. He was bighearted enough to laugh it off. I think the Germans were used by my Chinese fathers that were small detector. Even as they were drinking, my mother told us later, she knew that something was a drug. As well, the doggie or deed headed to Malawawa, they were planning to fly. My father, of course, just got to it's for a new birth. Although back to the autosawba of the airport, she did some questions, safety about the bus. Never quite explain. Please, my travel official, Shabby Boose, with my parents, who are wealthy merit. I beg of you. the people of the bus, they are not good. My father stood firm. Why ride the plane for an hour when he could sit on the bus for an hour? And save almost $3. For four people. Besides, he is the state. He are not stupid tourists. He will go the way, then he just go. It will be so much more education. But of course, our new German friends were not by that. mother was stuck. So she fudge the truth. Just a little. Bunch, have you heard about so fabulous and bust? She asked the group over that festive Ethiopian dinner. She herself was fabulous that night. Chris, dark hair set off by fire and red dress big amper-beats. The scenery is absolutely stunning. You will miss it all by play. Everyone takes the bus. It is what it is done. Perhaps a little plastic. So immediately hear it out loud. He's just a one place, man. And, sir, under party. Meet. Please, my friends, you must take the bus without a place. Life is too short, too short. Because, yeah, all of us trapped. You should go. For and people, you can't foreign land. There was a hash. Then an explosion had been in with me, something was wrong. So the mood is bright, if somewhat hung over the next morning when we all recognize Earth bus station yet another newer field. Guten Morgen! My mother calls out, Guten Morgen! The Germans cry back. They supervise the small Ethiopian half-sphere fabulous leather  a Johns Hopkins robust, tying it all down with skewed twine. The many Ethiopian pests, the women in black, Muslim, and and workshops recalculed pretty much ignored us, busy with their unchecked 색bras. a small detail, I might be  to put it later, which we tell this line. A small detail is there's not one but two buses heading out towards Malawinistan. We and the Germans are all assigned to the first bus. Our family is further subdivided to three seats together in this and one way way back on the changes. My father's good, but here's the... the V. R. seats are right in the group. floor rises up under our feet. We can't stretch our legs up. 4 9 out. And as I told you, my mother is 5 for November. Busc officials see all the opposed to us change our seats. Why? First bus is small. For some odd reason, they do not want such But we cannot sit there, we cannot find God! It isn't tolerable! We are not enamelals! And then, in with the haymener, I will go to the American Consulate! Big Go! Without a word, three of us are moved to the second bus, far from anyone we'd. The buses navigate their way down treacherous mountains, mountains are beautiful, treacherous, and they're jagged blue. Occasionally a small path. and child and soil, go the day around, slide the side of the road. Wait, small shop dates off from the distance. Thaaaaaaaaaaaaa! The road zig-zags zig-zags. At the end of each hairpin turns the lone white cross. I drop off just. Pop in! a sound of truck backfiring, drooled to me away. All around us, heat your skin pests are dropped into the floor. There are shelves. All it wants,  a congregation, Ethiopian rise, found out that I am, fingers laced on top of their heads. My mother does not say two words to us. She kneel swiftly, hands fly over our beds. She stuffs all of our families, passports, and travelers, checks under keyfills in my plouses, smoothing our waistbands to hold them in place. Are we there yet, I ask? I mothered, claps her hand over my mouth, and pushes me towards the door. When I get there, I see what... the twin forces, venture and economy, and products. Not a pervillian of happy dancing people, but irretrain terrorists, clad in military fifties, firing machine guns randomly to the air. Head of us, Ethiopian pest farmers cheat black perishes cut from her mind, obedient and Ethiopian sheep, found down the stairs for ourselves into the war. Here's the second one, the firing squad formation. All around us is the blankness that you're a train desert. The head of us, the road stretches out towards Malawa, who will put the red sea, pity and empty. Oh God, I think, oh God. Now I look up into the wide blue sky. Great blue depth is mesmerized, oddly peace. So this is it, I think. The end of Malaw. Right here, no more sour than any. There were hazelnuts. I will never grow up to be 20. We will wait. We will not stop. Gradually, dots on us, the terrorists real interest, is in the first box, not second. 50 yards at the row. They will sell, friends, the ocean, and the fat couple have become a center of attention. They stand helplessly in their sumptuous. the flowery outfits, hands of the air, the leader's shafts. My eyes lies down the line of first bus pass. And there, towards the end is my father. With a small body, dark color, warm red sweater, the action kind of blends in. And I realized that moment with a kind of savvy world trappers consumed. My father will not be shocked at it. And it's a small way. The transiosers of Dulce and Fatcum love the other hand are being marched on towards the low-grad heels of his hostage. E-C-E-O-P-O! My mother cries out, this five years later, she's back in our dining room in Southern California, finishing the Pearl of the Reds story for yet another group in the West Pride dinner guests. It was totally corrupt. It put all the foreigners on the first bars to make it easy. It's not been for the wheel, the wheel. I and the puts a link and it would have been marched off as hostages as well. Our Deutsche in France were released two weeks later. But their passport, cameras, travelers, checks, they never got back. It's at point, they may had wish-teds low. But then they would not have saved that $30. Who needed to see the pearl of the red sea? Not us! That night we dined on hot dogs and chocolate milk At the American military base in Malawa He slept on metal beds It was so elegant Morgan 3, we were sure for a straight back to Lullibella The Amelitaric Convoy, which was finewist me, as long as I don't have to sit over the wing The Amelitaric Convoy Every way of lives and so do I, wanting the story to go on and on. But, years go by, mother gets more and more tired of telling you. Because the Ethiopian vacation comes to be the story of her marriage, compromise between two opposites that can never be made to work. Eventually my parents spent all their time alone in school and flight. I'm going to stop talking at all, live together in silence. The strange thing is that one. When my mother will do, sometimes after dinner party, they slip into the garage. Still in her amber beads, fire and red dress, she sits alone in my father's shifters to be with. What's the radio odd? It's what's the sear. His true mirage turns out to be not the program that's seen. That be when my mother had first seen it, that magical thing, the fifties. He's the car of true America, and would get a side path. that you would turn out to be an anomaly my father's life. You've slipped strapped into the room when she would never quite come. As a year went by, would make my father sick for anyone even to drive to waste my young gas. So while my mother left her world warped to behind, you could not forget the shame of.

It started in so enough year I began to know it's great and attended an all day plant for the apes in the early home at a budget theater a mile or so for my parents house. I had seen the original movie, Nine Times, waiting all nights for Vera to ask, what will he find out there in their forbidden zone doctor's aides? Followed by Charlton Testin's heartfelt damn you damn you all the hell!

He would pull out, and I'm waiting for the next one. exciting times. My father was cocktail, he printed me through his songs. He's always gracious. Same times to species.

I got a grandson out there about your age and if I ever caught him hitching a ride, I'd stick my foot so far up his butt, I'd lose my shoe. What do you think you're doing out there? Where are your people? I told her that my father was near Dup. My mother, she's... I'm going to be a long haul truck driver on runny don't see.

Some people pulled off because they were expecting hours. While others slowed down to study for hours, they were black ministers, fire monsters, light guards, college students and... and it would usually flow. Grolley wasn't that big down, but Grolley was more and more out of the way. I never hitchhiked beyond the city limits, but I was sent off to the power of the world. Her mother died in a living room, and died in a long, long, long, long, long, long, twice in the last four years. Grolley was dragged into sets of stepplanes. Grolley was top in the pen, well, well, well, well, well, well. She had a secret sleep up and boyfriends. Old memories and people in the internet.

We hadn't even got our first , over any. and those ones fall in bounds. Standing on the highway, thumb up in the end, people pass by, pretending not to care. I'd see who comes some great numbers, no more. He'd lie there but I'm a side to road, his head popped up on his abs and exercise his toes, one to one more than he runs. The guy just won.

The second thing I've got is a day off state farm, which worked out well for years. The latter, the swallow flashlight man, the shell out of 2000, so much fun. He sat in the back seat while I was in the storage bottle of lawn, and some flashlight, the small back, and the shins, and some shinelight offers his hand on his body. When I got back in the car, a star ski replaced the gas cap, and pushed me back seat. Detended half of our way, a role of bills. ready to accept pain. We reached the bumper just to start the old out of the station. Driving over concrete and bank in our nearest state. I'm not sure how cool this is, Dale said. What about the police?

Dale stayed for a week, leaving by boss the day after I walked in, standing naked for a full-length mirror, saying, San Francisco, you stole my heart. Now that I found you, I'll never pardon.

Yes indeed, maybe it's time we try that shoe on the other foot for it. You, my young friend, are going to wash my car. Inside and out, and you're going to pay for it. The exit of the inner state and headed for a car wash. The roof of which supported three cheerful seawalls, bucking the limousines with the motorized chains. The man stood beside the bumper, super-wise, and he was a shampoo and waxed his car. That's right, put it! little muscle into it. Next I want you to empty those ash trays and vacuum the interior. Top the bottom. Come on, speedy. Let's get clackin'. I had no problem with the work he was driving out of my mind. How does it feel to be given for a change? Not much fun, isn't? Hurry up now and bump those up tabs. Let me see you buff. You had me polish everything he and can have to go license plate beforehand to me my pack and drive away. I got to ride back to the interstate and another landed in the 20 miles below Charles's vest, which it was around for a clock and I hope I might catch a long ride through to a higher. It was cold in my hands with a chap from watching that movie, it was calling. My fingernails shone from the wax. I waited 10 minutes before someone slowed down and stopped on yards up the road. It was a pickup truck advertising in air. the mission of the situation. The man's shirt introduced in his team Delfin. His fingers were soiled with grease and powder his truck was littered with candy man for some 7 minutes. I asked him what TW stood for on and told me it stood for King Delfin and that his last name started with an aim so if you put it all the way out of the pattern, I asked him to join me. He had an open sincere face, the features set into a gesture and pointer as if he'd spent the last 10 years in a cup. on everything to me in this sensation. When I told him I was headed to Ohio to study medicine, he said, really? Be a doctor and operate on people? You must be some kind of smart to be a doctor. Operator brains, you say? I told him I'd already done it a few times, and it wasn't a solid excuse. I was hitchhiking because I've made a bet with a friend that I could get from Duke to Kent State in 18 hours. I didn't need the money. It's just something that a student is being developed. Well, I'll see that you win that bet,\" he said. He explained that he had cut out of work early and had to take the all the way to Ohio, seeing as he was in the night out. And he hadn't spoken to a doctor since his footed in the brush by an air conditioner a few years back. Look at me, he said, brushing the candy wrappers on his forehead, lighting with a brain doctor. We could get started as soon as he drops some papers off to a friend. That's what he told me. He drove off the inner state in an untoward series. highways and country roads before stopping the tapering. It was a single-block building lit with signs advertising brands and beer systems comfortable. He asked what I'd  to come in but I was underage and had not yet fell off the first rail at home. It was dust by this time to sign fading behind the surrounding mountains. I waited an hour, two hours, three. It had gotten to dark to leaves I had no idea where I was, hardly in cars passed along Rome. There were no street lights and I could hear flattened dogs barking off in distance. When it began to rain I took my pack in the bed of the truck and carried it up front, looting around for an extra sweater and a pair of socks I'd wear on my head. I stared at the lights of the bar wondering who might choose to live such a town. It was pretty enough. You might pass through when it... admire the mountains, but wouldn't a person then move on somewhere more important. Travel is supposed to broaden your mind but it had a way of pressing. The more places I went, the more people I saw, the more I realized I didn't matter to anyone except a family on that line. Do  them outside from their friends and neighbors, in a town just as pointless as this one? It brought me down to think about it so I turned down my transistor hand and listened to make it look more courage. TW staggered out of the bar with around 10 o'clock. He had his arms around the skinny, long-faced man, and at least one of them held a pocket book on her head and attached to the face. She said something in the man doubled over last. I was in a pretty bad mood, but when he had tried to be best to teach himself, he don't really have a right to play. Even before he got into the truck, I understood TW's drunk. He weighed goodbye to the man in one of them, and proceeded to start. the engine, jabbing the key here and there, so the admission might move, that it was absolutely could be anywhere on you. Those are my friends, he said, I've been knowing them all my life and they're fun people. You got that? His face had lost that innocent quality in term of sternum, no man. Friends, he shouted, personal, private friends who repeated the words several times, the sentence, and herube asked because his fists were acclaimed 8. me, my friends! Something told me we wouldn't be driving for a higher purpose. We reached the inner stage, I offered to get out, we would hear a bit. You're coming with me and said, home to my house with me. I've got a place fixed up nice with rugs and coasters and a lot of things  that. My house, mine! No way are you going out on a night  this. Forget all that other crap with school and college. It doesn't matter for Stanky's. What? I pictured his house if he's empty-handed. I hope he's looking for a way to get the street. He's the man of the planet. Once there I could have a remaker one. Big brain doctor, are you? to stick your fat little fingers and other people's skulls and think we're around? Is that what you  to do? I could use your plunge and tinker with high shot. I was looking out at the wet rail and didn't see it coming. He grabbed me by the hair and then my head down. I see, holding me there with one leged into a shaft pocket. The truck skated and swirled onto gravel shoulder when gravel leaves right in. The gun felt just the way I owned this new one. He held it against the side of my face, bare-albutting that's my job. I now imagine his home stacked with bodies seemed to be the exact place for something this my animal. Maybe he used his job skills, built a refrigeration chain, prevent the tear, or maybe he daringly beneath some tool shed and after what Jennifer threw down on Ragnows. When did I last bend to the dentist? Why wasn't I there now when mother smoking and waiting room popping recipes from my existence? My dentist would probably say I was asking for him. His dentist would show up on TV blinking into the camera to test the fire. He was such a nice man. We had no idea. I felt the car slowed down and picked up the turn. We were off the interstate. Probably on an exit. He raised the gun to study the wheel and I opened the door and jumped, thinking all the while the men and television detectors seemed to do this on a weekly basis. Jump and roll, I taught myself, jump and roll  manics  Barnaby Jones. I hit the gravel shoulder and tumble them to a muddy ditch filled with trashed crumbles. My pack had fallen out with me so I snatched up and ran. Behind me I heard the truck pull off the road, the door slammed someone coming through a thicket. I thought I should climb a tree, but that's what you do for bears. No bears will climb after you. I thought to get up and run, but he was too close now  he seems to be trees. He's called me, but he's not a bear, but still I can't climb the socks on my hands. I'm only shooting down or shooting now in the back lady, and the head and the arm blow my arm off the shoulder. What I needed was a gun or a knife. The Indians made knives and spears even now you'd see them in the souvenir shops, but how did they do what it took days probably maybe even weeks. I turned my head to look behind me and fell into a knot if going to the bushes. I didn't see any good trees. shining in the distance. Idiot, he called, hey you get back in this truck. He looked off to my right and I understood, I'm not going to hurt you get back here. I was only joking. Hey you, hey it's not even loaded. Look, he pulled the trigger. He's got to click. Come on out. Hey kid, I swear I was only joking. I watched his intern. Get your ass back, hey, duh. I'm talking to you! He lit a cigarette, tapped on the horn. He had an issue on warning, and lost weight. He rolled down the window and drove off slow. The door jar, and tablets. Wisdom, Zifra lost on. I waited until I could no longer see the pain of us, and then I ran down the exit. I was just waiting my arms and then someone stopped. The first two cars just in this heating, very warm up. Reason. I told them what had happened right before it's time pitched in breath and the driver turned and saying, sounds  you're up to bed, you're so. This was not sympathetic reaction, I was hoping for one. They'd picked me up, I think I had some dumb and quiet. We smoked in the pocket, and they drank, those are no mere doubts. That's my punishment. My reward was to take that reset rather word, it's not something else. I continue to hitchhike the next few years, but after the incident he dealt something seem to be changed. It felt as though I had been marked. I'd always counted upon trust. But now I know long, quite trusted that. By this time I was certain the old enough to own my own car. not weathered enough. People began picking me up with the idea I had more to offer than to. Drugs were the east part. I carried them as a courtesy, and all for them never ever. It was a sexual advance, and got it. I'd never been much to look at, but that never seemed mad. It's not what they. When I thought of sex, I pictured someone's ending on crying. I love you so much, that I don't even know who I am anymore. He was known to be a major prince, all the matters he was experiencing now. This thing was blive, it was what I had on him. I got the idea that we're married. Before I much when do you take that ass? I asked him, almost, almost, almost, and almost raised such a way that he followed me. I'm only kidding, Jesus, what's your plan? He studied myself in the need on your figure out what you've changed. I've changed, almost, almost, almost. I had an unpleasant experience in myari pop-aloud side of my life. The middle-aged man walked by a catman, and he went there. A few days later in Fayette, the lungs led down a darker road by him, the lungs to flush with the stomach. Second time you find yourself now, and the worst of the smell is coming to ask for self-sufficiency. I got an applause, never in your shot. But this day I still have a bright mind. It seems much to changes inside that and just not much of the light of the choice. I moved to city's decent public event cases. She called her and then you were receiving that. You hold out your hand for a lot of hold on. The drivers don't speak. You have to pay, I can get lost this. Every so often I find myself in college, living by a friend, in my parents' summer-bound sight. These young, poor, trapped, shallons here. He looks into your eyes, beginning to spend nothing.
