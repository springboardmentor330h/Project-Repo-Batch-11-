Notice he titled the book The Prince, not the little prince, but the little prince is actually by somebody else. He wrote for that. Bye. But in our American lives, the real era of intrigue and manipulation. For most of us is not adulthood. It's adolescence. When our social circle is at its most, constricting. Today on our program, a story of betrayal, with someone who holds David Koresh  powers of others, and who is only in the seventh grade. your radio playhouse. I'm Ira Glass. But before we get into the body of our story, we will try as adults to manipulate you a little bit and quite central let's check in with quite central Shirley Jihad. Hi Ira Glass. Hi. We're trying to manipulate the radio playhouse listeners. That's a negative connotation. or maybe. Yeah, and we have all these. Ice, how about? Entices of very. To do's. Geek. Oh, baby. You're in such a row here. Sure. Well, let's play stuff. Okay, well, I can tell you. We have special. Yeah, what is the phone number? We gotta sit with us on with this phone number. Three, one, two, eight, three, two, three, one, six, six, stop the music dramatically. Yeah, I know. Take a number. Do it again.

And I just want to say that we are so anxious to get you to call. We have very special premiums that we're offering during the coming alley that are available at no other time during the drive. We have three and a half or four depending on how you count them. The very first one, the very first one, I'm going to play a little clip of these. These are all audio things. We have, well, how to begin with this. A couple of weeks, well, very quick. Wait, wait, wait. One of them is we have a cassette of recent work by Dave. It's sederous. Much of it heard here on your radio playhouse. Some of it heard on morning edition, the Zall Newark, including two radio dramas by the pine tree game, which up here on your radio playhouse. That's one thing. Another thing is that we have this very odd CD called Shut Up Little Man, which listeners to the show heard. It's an audio verite of these two men recorded through the walls of their apartment as they argued with each other. And finally, we have this thing. A couple of weeks ago, two weeks ago. So we had a show where Julius Weene told the story of getting cancer. And she told the story of her self-gaining cancer and her brother getting cancer. And she told them to stand up comedy. And she was telling this in a place called Uncabberay. It's a club in Los Angeles. We're essentially comics, com, each week. And they tell what did basically sort of comic diary versions of their week. And Uncabberay has a CD that's really pretty wonderful with some well-known people and some not so well-known people. And here's a sample of this is they have about 10 minutes of Julius Winnie's cancer stories. Here is a sample of that. Okay, so we're in the doctor's office. And Mike is doing really great. ,  responding really well to the treatment. But he's had so many spinal paps. They can't get into the spinal cone anymore. So the doctor said I could have this in my mom. My dad's beating about the plague in India. That's a good diversion. And my mom is, , looking at the doctor's thing. I knew I was going to die. And , and this is our group of Nika says, , Michael, we can't can do spinal spinal cord anymore. So we're thinking about putting a shunt in your head. And , my brother goes, why does it? And he goes to shunt, , oh, what's shunt? , an artificial opening to the brain. And , and my nose will wear with this shunt B.

I'll check back with you in a bit. Thanks, Amber. So let's get to today's story. On this our radio show. This is a story of enemies. But some of the bitterest enemies are people who... used to be close friends, . And our story begins with the friendship of these two boys named Bob and Dave. And today's program will be in four acts. Act one. Dave's love. Act two. Dave's hate. Act three. Dave today. Act four. Another day. Then another day, the David's David's Daderis actually. We have a story by David's Daderis. So, act one. Our story takes place in a small town somewhere in the East Coast. David and I became friends and poor. And we're friends through sixth-pring. And I have to describe him physically because that's a huge part of his personality. He was, and he still is an extremely wierry person, very thin. He looks amaciated. And he also, his skin is  a John this yellow color. He was always... very acne, just very pale, pasty, and he just looked sick. I don't really know how we became friends. We were in class together in grade school, but as things progressed into fifth grade, it became pretty clear that our friendship was the most intense friendship in the class. We were talking on the phone at least once a day and for hours. We just... talk for hours and just make it to the left so hard. And that was why we always got separated in class was just because we were trouble makers. We were just we just made each other laugh a lot. We had very similar sense of humor. The scatological jokes were the primary jokes. And we, I was just thinking about this today when I was thinking, I remember this one thing that we used to do, which we did obsessively. Which is the, it's embarrassing to say it. We were obsessed with the words pooping. And we made this little thing where I would say poop and he would say pee and then he would say we and then I would say gilly gee. And so it would go kind of  poop pee, we gilly gee. And we said this over and over and over again and we tried we used to just take books and just insert the words poop and pee everywhere and we was  the one word that was just for some reason that was  a rallying call that was  our our motto. I don't know. I mean, we just set it all the time, just we. We used to do that all the time. We! Some of the other stuff that we had in common, we were our favorite group was the Village People. And we used to listen to the Village People all the time and just totally obsessed about them, having no idea what they were saying about, how. And the Duke's a hazard was another one. And Star Wars, those were very big things, and sports. I basically discovered sexuality through him and we used to place been the bottle in his room and we would take off an article of clothing for when it would land that us. And it was the first time we'd ever been naked in front of another person except for our parents. And it was petrifying but it was also just this whole discovery period. just seeing another another man making there. And it became this whole game that we played often. And we just would revel in the fact that just standing there in front of each other totally naked assuming these characters just , , hi Mr. Jones, how are you? Nice to meet you with businessmen and everything just standing there completely buck naked. And so terrified that we were ever going to cut because his parents were always home and they were always in the house and everything. We were just so afraid that someone was not going to die. And the one time that was the biggest scare was he, , Dave can basically get, could get anybody to do anything that he wanted them to do. And he, , had a camera and was just, these, these times when I would go to his house, we're just fully documented events. , he was so, he was very anal-retent of. And he loved just documenting everything he was going around, so he'd have a camera and take my pictures. And he wanted me to pull down my pants and take a picture of me with my pants down. And I was just refusing to do it. I would not let it be caught on film. And he was just insisting and he went through this entire, I mean, he just was trying to coach me for so long, just telling me all these different things that he was going to do for me. And just saying, oh, nobody's going to see it, , while he came up with this whole scheme of how nobody would see the film and everything. And just these elaborate, elaborate plans on how nobody's going to do. what he would see these pictures. And I just refused kept refusing and refusing. And, and finally at the end of it, he was , all right, just take down your pants anyway. I want to take a picture. I swear to you, I won't take a picture. I promise. And I still didn't believe him. And he was , look, I promise I promise I promise. This one I'm  an hour of him trying to cope to me to take my pants down. And he promised me, and bottom of his heart that he was not going to take a picture. And so I was , fine. So I was , unbuck in my belt. And I unbuck in my pants. I pulled down my zipper. Just sew up. whipped up with my pants and I had my underwear on. And then I put it myself all back together again. And when I had my pants open, he took a picture. And I was , oh, and I was pit terrified because when you're that age, when you're  11 and 12 years old, you can't go in and get your pictures developed, you're so often pay for them and get them and I thought somebody's gonna get these pictures developed and somebody's in the sea. So weeks later, I was going up to his house again. And in the car, going up to his house, his mother was driving. He was , that's pictures. And I said, oh my god, it was , you're not gonna believe what's on there. And I said, but what can be, I didn't, you didn't see anything. And he was , I know, but you have to see this because it's there. And I was , but it can't be because I didn't take my pants down. And he was , I know, but it's there, it's there. You have to see it. He pulls out the pictures. And I looked at it. And my penis was hanging out there. And I was , but I didn't do it. And he was , you must have. And I said, but I know I didn't, I know I just opened my pants. And he said, he must have done it. Maybe just thought or something. And I said, my campy and we racked our brains. Just trying to figure out what had happened, because I knew that I hadn't pulled my underwear down. So that night we were at a football game, high school football game. And we were looking at the pictures against examining them. We were way up in the bleachers in the corner. And we took them on. We were looking at them when we were trying to explain what had happened. And finally, we figured out that it was the inside of my that looked  my penis and we were , ah! And so I was completely relieved, but I made him, I watched him just tear up the picture into  a thousand pieces and went through this whole elaborate method to  bury the pieces in the bottom of a trash can or this football stadium. And I was still petrified as someone who was gonna find them and  piece them together. The point that it started to change. was as we were going to sixth grade, we were constantly being separated in class. And that's around the time when people start to realize that there's a difference between someone who's straight and someone who's gay. And there was just grumbling happening. People were accusing us of being homosexual. And we weren't anyway, but we also knew. evolve it, , all the things that we had done with each other and each other presents. And I think when people started thinking that we were gay, we suddenly that just rose to the surface. And we realized that there was a cool thing and not cool thing. And we were definitely not cool in the friendship that we were in. And that's also around that time when, in my town at least, I think a lot of small towns were sports just become the most important thing in the life. life. And I was not a good athlete then at all. Dave was a good athlete. And Dave organized a big football party one weekend where we were going to go out there and play football and have a sleepover and then the next day play more football. Dave just organized this knee Laggy's leg, Un ballable, he had. Jersey's printed up with numbers and names on him. He had teams with rosters. He had practice for his team with plays. There was  a playbook. This is  for a little football game, three on three football, four on four football. Touch football. And every single minute was decided upon the forehand by him as to what we would do, where we would be, what we would eat, the food we would eat. When we would play football, it was all timed out. He's just he is so organized in the lieutenant but I don't remember very well But I can't imagine that I played tremendously well and I think I was thinking about this today. I was trying to To think of the moment when everything changed and it I'm almost positive. It was that event It was a football party and immediately after that he just totally stopped talking to me How Dave turned the class again, Bob, as I show continues. Now have you read of the table of Keenan, Keenan? Once they're walking in the sky, they'll shoot down. Came to game, my jealous of brother, Keenan. So he rules up and smoke a breakdown. Lord, she was hopping mad, and yet he was going to say, to think that he had a man  King. Lord spoke and showed his wrath, and King walked the pan that led to a life full of pain. You can't run from the shadow of retribution. If you're bad, then you've got a place for you wrong. Let yourself take a lesson from Canaanabel. Don't lament, be content.

Dave and Bob were best friends and now Dave started using all the tactics that adults use in a political situations in power situations. All the tactics one uses to turn people against one another, whispering in ears, things  that. Bob, who's now a theater director in New York City, by the way, Bob tells the story. I remember going into class in seventh grade on the first day school and him not talking to him. And everybody just wondering I mean the whole school was wondering why there was this big fight And I remember just not having an answer for him. I used to tell them to ask they I had no idea And I used to tell people that he just stopped talking to me and I remember that he became completely bent on Turning everyone against me the whole school and And he did it very well because he's so organized and because he's so manipulative. And I saw him and I saw him telling people to say things to me. And he, he was in one who formed the I hate, they used to call me Kuz then. And he, he was in one who formed the I hate Kuz club. He used to, he used to, he never did anything to me himself. He would never come up to me and make fun of me. He would never come up to me and hit me or he would never assault me personally. But he would just get everyone else to do it for him. So he would send people to say things to me. , I remember one time in the lunch room, Sam, saying, , if he ever been caught masturbating. And of course, either answer is, you damn yourself. You answer yes or you answer no. And I remember hearing Dave tell him to ask me that. I used to just get made fun of horrendously by everyone. And I remember hearing Dave tell him to ask me that. make fun of the way that I chewed at lunch. People would make fun of the way that I laughed. People would make fun of the way that I coughed, that I sneezed. People would make fun of the way that I walked. It was just this teasing. But that makes it even sounds less violent than it was. It was just a mocking. It was a very pointed mocking on everyone's part. I remember sitting alone at the lunch table. no one's talk to and just wanting so badly for no one to turn their attention to me because I knew the detention will be negative. I remember just not understanding what was going on. , I had been in such a sweet position with this person. We had such a good friendship and then all of a sudden everyone had just turned against me. And he wasn't  a pie-piper. He was so subtle and he was so quiet and he never really... I don't think he ever had a friendship with people  he had with me, but he was just able to organize people into these different factions. He would just say, , go over to the clues and just shove the lock. And stick to do it. That was the worst period I think of my entire life, was that period. As it's enough at least. school. I go to my dog and hug my dog and say, you were my only friend in the world. Then he started to kind of needle me. I remember one thing he did was there was this guy Mike in my class and Mike was what we called in my hometown, Eskummer, which meant that he was on welfare everywhere. perhaps didn't have a pair of pants for every day at the week. He was, , very smart, which was a struck against him, that age. And he just didn't fit in. He was a real geek. And so Dave organized this fight between Mike and I, a fist fight to prove who was the bigger faggot, whoever would lose was the bigger faggot. And he positioned us, he spun it. So there was no way at, could not fight. If I didn't have this fight, then I would just be things would just get worse for me. Things would get worse. I mean, Mike was  at the bottom of the barrel, and I was there with him, and Dave had to prove that I was blown. And so he organized this whole fight. And everyone in the class was , , Mike, you're going to fight Mike. And I finally just conceded, and I conceded the fight. And Dave organized the whole thing. It was to happen at this playground and We went and he tried to get this whole audience to come and see it Unfortunately nobody came but him while I guess fortunate nobody came but him and one other person and So Mike and I went there and neither of us wanted to fight each other And I was had any reason in the world to fight each other So I just remember standing there facing him just  laughing just  what was supposed to do we're standing here? We've been forced into this just to save our own souls and And now Now we have to  inflict pain on each other. And we stood there for the longest time and Dave kept trying to push us in the fight. He was saying, come on, it's so punch, it's so punch, it's just start. We waited for the longest time and finally I was just  this is ridiculous. So I went up and I shoved him. And then we started the fight. We weren't really into fighting, but we had to do with him. And I pushed him at one point and he fell backwards and he hurt his wrist. I got on top of him and I held his wrist. And I remember saying to him, do you give up? And he wouldn't give up. And I was holding his wrist back. And each time I kept asking me if he was going to give up and he kept saying no. And each time he'd say no, I'd bend his wrist back a little bit more. And he was crying and pain. And I kept saying, I'm going to bend the back. I'm going to bend the back. I'm going to bend the back. Thinking, I want to break this first. I have no reason to break this first. And I was faced at that moment with either giving up. and just getting kicked even more or going ahead with really hurting this person and hoping that it would save me in some way. And I broke his wrist. He came in the next day in school with Caston. I don't know how his family paid for his cast. And everybody saw that and said, You idiot, Cruz, what did you do? Idiot. And they just... It made it even worse. I just was so... I just didn't understand. I didn't know it was for a young, that's the most frustrating thing. Even still today. I always thought it was me. I always thought it was something I was doing. I thought it was some way that I want my clothes. I thought it was the shoes that I wore. I thought it was the way that I laughed. I remember. I remember I tried to change the seasons. I tried to change the seasons. I tried not to laugh so loud. I tried to cough differently. I mean, they made fun of them. They made fun of the most minuscule things. They're just human,  chewing. , if they would have noticed the way that I breathed, they would have made fun of that. I remember I tried to live, tried lifting weights. And it was just impossible because it was nothing I could do to make them change their minds. If I lived in weights, it was the way that I lived to weights or it was just something. And they would come up with something. was just a no-win situation, but it was always, and I knew how smart he was, and I knew how well he knew me, and I guess all of a sudden, I thought that he had seen all these things of me that were just wrong. And just so not cool. I remember very clearly there was a moment that the clouds just cleared and everything became possible. I went to the Pennsylvania Governor School for the Arts in my junior year. The summer between my junior and senior year, that was when I met people who were actors I was, who were my age and who respected me. And I remember very clearly I was after lunch and people who were in my theater class had, we were going on a cafeteria and I forgot my bag in the cafeteria. And I went and I said, oh, just wait for me one second. I just want to go get my bag and I went down to the cafeteria and got my bag and I came back up and they were still there waiting for me And I remember so distinctly remembering oh my god these people they waited for me That meant so much because I felt  I'm not this idiot. I'm not this geek I'm not a person who everyone should hate. I'm actually a pretty good human being people  me Sometimes I feel  there's some justice in the fact that I'm surrounded now by many people who love me and respect me and I don't know how many people he has in his life. But the tables have turned in that way and when I go back home and I see people looking at me the way that they looked at me in high school I think there is some justice because those people are probably some of those people I've heard are in bad situations with their families. They've got wives. They don't love, they've been through the horses, they don't have friends there. In the same bar they were in four or five years ago drinking the same beer they drank and they're got his little bigger and it was a little redder and they just look tired and I feel  my life is pretty good shape and happy and that's the sweetest we're dealing with. revenge and last Christmas I ran into him at a mall and he looked more John-dist and more sickly than ever. Bob says that it was because Dave made him an outcast in junior high school that he ended up spending a lot of time with the theater teacher. The theater kids went park. And this teacher put him in plays and took him to plays in New York City, showing him that there was a bigger world outside the hometown. If it weren't for Dave, I would not be doing what I'm doing right now. There's no way. I don't know what I would have been doing. But because of what he did to me, he put I found theater and it's been a really good life. Good life. Bob's a director in Manhattan, Dave gives his version of the story, in Act 3 of your radio playhouse. I love you, Bob. I don't dig you. Forgive you for my friend. Thought you were my pal.

I'd have tried to put on some black card again, or something. The mock turtle neck, I thought. I'll show you. I can do the scene. And I saw these two men that were so hardcore. One had the other one on a leash, the nipples were pinched, things were hanging. And all kinds of apparatus I couldn't even identify. So I inched close to them because I wanted to go, I want to hear what these two are talking about. And I inched behind them in this guy said, I just love that angel cake. It was so moist.

Again, these are premium, some of these that are only being offered tonight, surely we'll check back with you in a couple minutes. Thanks, Amber. Call, please, call, we were trying to figure out stuff that you might enjoy now as ever. Well, Act 3. Dave's response. It's an odd thing, actually, as a reporter, calling a stranger on the phone, and asking him to defend things he did, 15 years before as a teenager. Who amongst us wants to get that call? Okay? So I reached Dave at his parents house where he still lives and he's devout Christian now He writes and edits a Christian magazine for young people and he says that he's never been happier No, he does not really think about Bob very often No, Bob is not a big figure in his life. No, he does not remember the fight with Mike Yes, he remembers being enemies with Bob in the seventh grade, but no, he wasn't sure why the best that he could remember Bob was to blame Bob Bob, by becoming friends with someone else. But he asked me what they were just  doing these other things. It was just , , I got really mad and everything. It was  going from , master's and , worse. I've been in front of trying to remember this. And he remembers it. Is this also accurate? Do you remember this as well? He remembers you turning other people against him. He says it then. at one point there was actually a eye-hate-cuse club that you started. Oh gosh. Again, I don't even remember that. But now that you say that I, , gosh, that's what a terrible person. I'm just, because that's horrible. But, oh, man, I actually kind of remember that now. That's pretty lame. What do you remember of it? I don't. That's just it. And when you said the name is , oh my gosh, that was... Did I really do that? I have no idea. I mean when he describes you during that period he felt  you had a kind of David Karesh  power over others. Well I mean we were high school. I'm trying to think of, , huh. Can you, can you imagine yourself being seen in that line? No, not really at all. , looking back now I feel  I was always the one that was  really totally at the bottom of the social list. or whatever you want to call it and  what it caused me to do something that is it's  obviously to make myself look better or something because I don't know but that's pretty bad. I tell you the way that  Bob remembers and interprets what happened between the two of you. He doesn't remember it as as being the kind of thing where he became friends with somebody else. He says that. that you guys are really, really close, really close friends. And then when everybody hit adolescence, a really typical thing happened to you, and that is that other boys started accusing you of being gay, and that you publicly just wanted to put a stop to it. , honestly, I can remember this. He has a much better memory than me. I know we were close, everything. I don't ever, ever remember. I remember, and any accusation,  that, no. And I'm trying to think too, I'm trying to  drag it out of my memory. why did we start fighting in the first place? I think, but. Actually the thing that is making me think about is, in the case of a story  this, I think it's easier for a person who was the injured person. It's easier with the injured person to remember something. And then the person who did something. hurtful because I think it's so much more embarrassing to remember yourself as being someone who did something hurtful. Right. Yeah, no, no, no. I work with kids and everything that are about that age. And they get in their little spat sometimes, , and I just, , we just always go to the Bible together and we, , I try to say, well look, , this person is your friend. , we just had to  this last week. This one girl that, , her friends all the sudden, is what doctorate. something to bear with most business is that, , at least you need someone to tell that they're worth a moment. , honestly, she's such a nice person. She isn't  you or what she has, she's not  you, she's  a funny、 versus a sister, doing  that. Your mother and your heart. I felt really bad for this person because she's she's always  one of the gay I think I'm thinking I gotta get a hold of her and see what's wrong and everything Get all the people back together because this is good Hello, hi, it's Bob there. Yes, it's Bob So after I spoke with Dave I called Bob I guess you can figure that for out for yourself You describe him going and sort of whispering and people year, Yago  saying go do this, go do that, walk up to, walk up to Bob and say this to him, push him in the locker and keep remembers none of that. I remember that very clearly. Well, keep remembers none of it. I remember a very clearly. I mean, those things that stuff that's scarred me for years and years and years and it's no surprise that I remember it. , thinking about what happened to you, just thinking about it over the last few days. It's really made me think about what it means to love somebody. how when you love somebody, you're always more aware of what they do in the room than anybody else. ? And because you guys really love each other, anything that he would do in a room would be something that would be more apparent to you than what anybody else was doing. And would seem more important. And so if somebody else were just as influential over other kids in the class, would you always be more aware of what A. did. Yeah, he was his I would say all the activities were illuminated more to me than to anyone else because of that. But I do know that he was the he was the focal point or all of this antagonism against me. Right, those years. No doubt. I mean, he generated it. It didn't just come from nowhere. It's not thing to have a profound experience with somebody else, really intimate experience. And you remember every detail of him. And the other person remembers none of it. And so you left there alone. When I talked to Bob, I asked him about this over and over and over again because I thought he was such a particular kind of moment for him. Shut up but he didn't really take it. That way. I don't know. I have no reason to feel lonely about this. , I don't expect Dave to remember it. What you're saying sounds  I should have an Amosity towards him because of what he did to me. No, I don't mean an Amosity at all. Actually, in fact, just the opposite simply simply someone else to confirm that it happened, that it happened and that it had a meaning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You may be right. Yeah. No, I feel alone. No! Hahaha! Hahaha! Hahaha! I mean, yeah, it would be... I can see myself saying, but Dave, don't you remember, this was a massive event in my life. For me, , for me, I feel , okay, I see... It's , as you were talking, I was thinking, , well, this is the Gabrielle Garcia Marquez part of the story. Well, ... is memory lost. Does memory, does memory last? Does it mean anything if  an entire nation forgets what it was? Or, , does it mean anything if we are the only one who remembers an experience and then we are lost? And so that experience is never remembered. Does it mean anything? Yeah. You're saying really? No. Maybe it's something to me, but no, not really. And I can assure you that I am , is it? I'm gonna pronounce the name wrong. It's Jorge Luis Borges. he says I remember remembering the last time I remembered it, which was the memory of the last time I remember it, which it increasingly gets more and more dramatic. And the moment gets refined down to, it gets to still down into something which becomes very palatable and very understandable. One who sent in the whole thing of course was the friend, the mysterious friend, remember date. said that Bob was to blame for them becoming enemies in the seventh grade. By making friends with a guy who he retold his name to Mike, though not the Mike who's wrist bump. I can sort of understand that. I know which Mike you were referring to and I know that we did start to become friends then, but friendship that I have of day was always the strongest friendship that I ever had until almost five years. I'm really going when I met the person I can swim in best friend now. He always used the term false friend. That was an Instagram, remember that. Really, he used always say I was a false friend. Meaning what? I don't know what does it mean. It means you were a friend, but now fake or it's... See, to me, false friend means that he thinks that you betrayed him. Good day? Good day. Wouldn't it be awful if  it all boiled down to  one of the ant where he felt me and Mike were between me friends and it could have been cleared up in one  just  one conversation that it was a complete misunderstanding that it was just a total honeymoon understanding that could have been cleared up happens all the time wouldn't it be having just why I would just love to see what my you life would have been  if that would happen. In X4, another perspective on the whole thing from David Sidarris. First let's go to quite central Shirley's Yihad. I'm a glass. Hi honey. Hi sweetie.

Some one of the again we have special premium one is the Uncabber ACD one is the Shut Up Little Man CD Which maybe I'll just play a little clip of that real fast. It's a very odd CD These two guys who would fight all the time and it's sort of audio verite recorded by their neighbors next door as these two men would scream at each other. Here we go. Here comes the house. So why would I worry about it? For God's sake, John O'Bakwell man. I feel the worst one you can do at your home and I would  to have eaten terrible pieces. I'm from Hell. Now I should say the music in there is actually from my little mix that we did on the show. And this is one of the things that I'm going to get a sense of just in a free-footed clip. Another thing we're giving away is recent work by beloved Empire Comotator David Sidiris. And then it includes work that he's done here on your radio playhouse that is some of the radio play, he's done with the sister Amy and other actors. And this piece, this half-hour hitchhiking story that he told. Here's one little brief. episode from from that school. I got an Terminable ride with a panty host salesman who spent six hours saying you just take and take don't you? Don't you out there with your thumb and the air? Not a care in the world, grab it whatever you can get. Yes sir, you take and take and tell your ready to burst. But what about given the jibber think about that? Of course not, you're too busy taking. Me, I'm what you call a tax payer. Tax, it's a terrorist that working people have to pay. so that someone  you can enjoy a life-fliser. I give and I give, but till I've got nothing left, then I turn right around and I give some more. I give and give to all the vunkelsams little takers. And I've been thinking that maybe it's about time, I get a little something in return. Yes indeed, maybe it's time we try that shoe on the other foot for a change. You, my young friend, are going to wash my car, inside and out and you're going to pay for.

And this is story by David Sedaris, frequent morning edition commentator member of the Pintree gang contributor to this program. And this is a story of ultimate Machiavelli in Machiavelli in scheming. This is kind of an end point as to how far you can go. It's called the last time you'll ever hear from me. It's a story and it's read by Sarah Tire. Dear friends and family, by the time. you receive this letter, I will be dead. Those of you attending this service are sitting quietly, holding a beautiful paperweight, a gift from the collection which, in life, had been my pride and joy. You turn the paperweight over in your hands. Look deep inside at the object embedded in the glass, be it a rose or scorpion, whatever, and through your tears you ask, what is death ? By this time I I certainly know the answer to that question, but I'm unable to give details. No only that I will one day meet you upon the grassy plains of heaven, where, with the exception of Randy Saxon and Annette Helper, I will be tickled to embrace you and catch up on all the news. If my instructions were followed the way I wanted him to be, see a touch in instruction envelope number one. This letter is being read to you from the pulpit of the simple shepherd church of Christ by my best friend, Ali Miki. And we're in the long-sleeved Lisa Montino designer dress I left behind that always looks so good on me. I'll be. I hope you either lost some weight or took it out some on the sides or you're not going to be able to breathe. Also remember it needs to be dry clean. I know how you and your family love to skimp. But please don't listen to what anyone says about Woola. Dry clean. Most of you are probably wondering why I did it. You whispering. Well, Lord, why I take Trish Moody. Trish was a ray of brats on shine, always so up and perky and full of love. Pretty, too. Just as smart and sweet and pretty as they come. You're probably shaking your hands and thinking there's plenty of people a lot worse than Trish moody. There's her former excuse for Boyfriend, Randy Sachs for example. The boyfriend who, after Trish accidentally backed her car over his dog, practically beat her senseless. He beat her with words, but still. It might as well have been with his fists. He struck her again and again with words and names such as manipulative, jealous, childish, and others are wouldn't justify in print. The dog's death was a tragic accident, but perhaps also a blessing into skies as Randy tended to spend entirely too much time with it. What did Trisha's mother say when her daughter, heartbroken over her breakup with Randy, came to her and search of love and understanding? If you're looking for sympathy, you can find it between sob, story, and ciffulness in the dictionary. Perhaps my mother can live with slogan such as this. I know I can't. Neither can I live surrounded by friends such as a net kelper. Poor, chubby, a net kelper. Who desperately tries to pretend that nobody notices the fact that she's balding on top of her that's right. Look closely. Baldi, just  a man. Perhaps Randy feels sorry for Chrome dome net. Maybe that's why he was seen twice in her company in a single five-day period. Sheen standin' together in the parking lot of the Burger Tabernacle, her home away from home, and seen Huddle together, laughing on the escalator of the Crab Tree Valley Mall. A net must oppose a best friend, who secretly wanted and coveted everything I owned. Everyone on Earth. as too fast as a net helper? Is everyone as cruel as Randy's size? I think not. Most of you, the loved ones I left behind, are simple devoted people. I urge you now to take a look around the room. Are Randy's socks and a net sitting in the audience? Are they shifting uncomfortably in the pew? Shielding their faces with the eight and a half by 11 photograph of me, I had reproduced to serve as a momentum of this occasion. I lean. We this part real fast before they have a chance to leave. Randy Sachs drip is a size of my little finger and that's when it's hard and I'm not counting the nail just a finger. He had sex two times with the boy at Camp T. Conda Roga when he was in junior high school. Maybe that explains why he loves it. With somebody sticks their finger up his cuban. He used a bag, me to do that but I refused. I said no way Randy. He used to do it to himself all the time. That's why I never held hands with him. He's hand stink. He secretly thinks he looks  Marlon Brando but take a good. look. A young Marlin Perkins smore  it. Maybe that's what he sees in a net kelp or he's an animal lover. She used to come to my house crying and her breast melt in my life  her uncle's drip. She said he forced her but that's  as you owe force horse and that's what she is a whole net Randy deserve each other. Drip, wrath and stink to finger. Right up and down escalator, crab tree valley up and down, up and down. Fancy little shut-cut. Let's look at them. Take a good hard look at them. It's their fault I'm dead. They are to blame. I urge you now to take those paper and propose puppy Stone there, I'm release your anger. The Bible says it's all right to cast the first stone if someone did is telling you to do it, and I'm telling you now, pretend the paper weights are stones and cast them upon the guilty. I put aside my savings to pay for the damages to the wilds and windows. It's money I was saving from my wedding and there's plenty of it. So throw, hurt them the way they hurt me. Kill them! Nobody will hold you responsible. Kill them! I leave. I'm going to allow a few minutes here because it might take a while for certain people to get into this. swing up, pop in the cassette mark stoning, and wait until both Randy and a net are lifeless. Wait until everyone is finished with their paper wipes, and then I want you to hand the microphone over to my mother. Watch the way she trembles and stutters, and remember every gesture as if you were me. So, if you have all of us, let me tell you something. You'd have most no good at cat, I ever met. Even eat them all, my red bean and rice, you can't have bite. in the back for my wife, who would talk? You wait, of course, so I'm a tell you, I think. I'll be glad when you say it to us with you.
