  "text": "Chugberg is a businessman in Dallas, Vietnam vet, and about 10 years ago, who was in charge of a campaign, that was trying to build him a memorial to honor Vietnam vet's farm Texas. It wasn't easy. The immediate public reaction was Washington, he had money for those moms. Some of his drug-skirts started doing research, so we could prove to people that most Vietnam vet are not moms. They've jobs, and they go crazy and work, including utterly normal lives. Then right in the middle of the building net, there was a murder here in Dallas, a bigger killed policeman at a track. And the headlines basically said Vietnam that it rose was our imperial week. It was follow-up stories about how Vietnam made you knew it. You were in this situation, but this is going to hurt your fundraising. Well, it was hurt my fundraising. And every time a bad story  that appeared, I would get kind of heckled fun people when I was trying to get money. Hey, Birkin saw that. I'm wondering if you'd always went crazy by us. Okay. Mr. Birkin is not the kind of man who sits by and I really watch his things that it helped. I love the sound of the sound that they caused. to get to the other side. Anyway, I checked this particular fellow's individual monitor right in turn, I didn't know what certain of it did. I'm going to let you maybe three months and kick down the side button. We live in a world full of people faking this thing in that, and it turns out that spotting a fake Vietnam vet is one of the easier lives to get to the bottom of. Mr. Burkit started routinely checking the bonaclides that anybody in the news who claimed to have served in war, claims that he's found hundreds of fake news. This covers some famous people, fitting about their service records. to buck up the public images  after Brian Dankey. He found defendants in murder cases, claiming to be war heroes, hoping to be the rap. Well, ultimately, claiming the war made them crazy and they can't be held responsible. He found big public events, misreported. I remember killing up an Edmund Oklahoma on the first mass killing, the post-Ore14 post-warpers. Sure. Well, again, Vietnam veterans, those desserts, check the mass military record, and they're served. Vietnam. ... Not because of me. The reason about these cases is that they outrageousness of the lives. The A officials and career officers who fabricated and exaggerated among people who could easily catch them out. A soldier who's quoted extensively in the book, we were soldiers once and young. History of the Battle of Vietnam's Eyedrain Valley. There was a man in her name, Christchurch, right in the middle of the battle. And of course I think, oh, history, Christchurch, I think, skips her out. I'm just talking about who they're talking about me on the three lines, all this . Christchurch after war actually founded their alumni. Harder than perking. the big fixture in the first half division organization, ultimately became his president. And somebody gave me a tip that, , this may not have quite been up and I got his military brother. The guy had been discharged four months before that night. He was an innovator. And yet he had convinced everybody who was in battle and he was with him, so he was a joke. I mean, he convinced the people in the same squad, the same cartoon, he convinced the company commander, he convinced, and I mean, not only did he convince them, they all left in there, they're present. I think as the person who has to convince people that he is the real thing, he's going to do a much more aggressive job of being the real thing. The person who actually is the real thing. You are going to know more about that battle in the game, with the soon everything written by the gender of the gender of the gender. You don't want to know anything. , the guy who was there, it just was an episode of Flash Botany when I was in all directions. What's today in our program, the real thing, stories of people drawn to some ideas and pictures, some things they just want to be, some people doing it instantly, some less innocent life. And now, is it just a slip from one to the other? Let me be easy Chicago, publicating international, it's a American life, I'm our advice. At one of our program today, my life with a thrill-kill coat, a mutual woman as part of a job starts hanging around with some people. and gang members. Slowly find their self-change and wish addresses, which are talking, changing her cigarette brand to theirs. Back to black  me, the story of hockey and basketball, and what it means to be really black, back three, draw. What's it means to talk  a real subter? My one multimillion-dollar industry can seem to figure it out, that's more real love. No illustration from Sandra Love, the rule that if it seems too good to be true, maybe it isn't. Let's do this. That one. One of our show today is the story of somebody who tried to get closer to the real thing, tried and why in the end did that go to hell. Killing the Gevers was a newspaper writer here in Chicago and starting to get interested in stories she was hearing about girl gang members. Now she was somebody who did not know much about that she got in the sun and tried to get closer to her. I've got 50 miles. It was at leadup 1983.shadow and I started just sort of riding around the day and then I had a couple of sessions. So I started to stop by this on the corner and ask for songs so maybe he can hit songs so I don't have long left minutes to make it go  I'm just sort of driving around that. And my first good connection. is a two twins, 17, or very much a little longer. I drove up in my car and made fun. I was, because someone wants to install his station. So they came running up to my car. I'm , you're straight, you're straight, what you need, what you want, , and I was really what I'm doing here. And I've seen some of these. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. So, oh, you want to know about girls jumped in my car and we were riding around. And that's how it's going. And so, at first, I didn't get you to go out. So, yeah, it was pretty, yeah. So, yeah, then, you can be right down all the streeters that they saw. and then stand. Sentences for us. Wow, happy re-eleven, really. Right now. We'll choose. , this slide is right. Seeing who's there. Who's the button? And then going to the next slide, you guys can find what you saw. last five. It's, there's 17 years old. There's really not that much going on. No go to school. No. Work. There's just not a lot to talk about. Except each other. And always there was always someone fighting someone. There was always some drama going on and any given time in the day. Some girl was mad at somebody else. And it was, it was more that it was different than anything I don't know. then it will be this moment in sightings. Well it sounds  the excite moves. And it sounds  the place you have the one on the screen. But the thing, but this is the 17th. Slowly, and I don't know when this started to happen, Let's go! conscious of it. He's not really well. He's not really well. He's coming now. I started to dress a little bit. I started wearing lots of sports, t-shirts, jeans, and sweatpants, and platform shoes, and pulling my hair back, and wearing darker lipstick, and just starting to fit in. Trying. And after the second story, I'm honest. mind. Keep the time. How are you talking? Just a little bit with an edge. Hey, Kelly. What's up? How are you doing, mister? Oh, what's going on? , just a little bit. I mean, maybe that sounds  a lot, but, , if you're standing around with people you can't answer it then, a little bit of that, a little bit of damn, . Oh, look at him. He's fine, . Maybe not flying. I wouldn't say it  that, but just a little. I, , something indefinite, a little more had me gesturing that I really do before. It won't be easy to get to this restaurant, it is. Yeah. Okay, this is hipster recipe. And so, what we're talking about, I'm sort of doing it and doing it. It's a very funny thing. She's very loud and opinionated and at one point, young woman who looks  Rockstar, no, as says to Linda, this is the film, I mean, we're hearing, is anyone using that chair? She's , yeah, my foot. And she's just kidding. really  the scroll very sat and it's offended and she's  no no no you can't have my chair I'm just kidding I'm just kidding honey and she's yeah but never okay there's something  a detergent and it was so funny to me because I got to be on there's love I was dead as they were fighting So, so have I did for... There was a working method photographer and  she had just come on and he's talking in the city. He's really trying to make a bit impression. He's trying to be very professional and both things  that. Because that guy sucked her into this whole thing. And so... and the night when we drive in the left, people are huge. And they get two car loads of people driving. And all of a sudden, the other car, from the mostly gang guys, the old guys, and the old guys, who started racing, they took off from the light, started to move around, and going down to the large app, very busy street going eastbound to the lake. And so the guys in the car, are we that come up? And Heather, come on, you can do it, , just bust through these lights and she's , no, I can't do that. Now I can't do that. So I'm behind her, go ahead and do this. I mean, we're really happy for cool, . I mean, that wasn't what I was saying, that was what I was thinking. I can do this. How do you have to do it? And I mean, she didn't want to do it. And she did. She did. She ran the light. She ran the light. She did. She did. She ran the light. She ran the light. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove, Ik. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove on. She drove, she drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She drove. She thought it was me. She thought it was me. She'd been in pain, I was heartless... I was so scared.... I  her out, she was there, we were bothboat police. She was freaking out, I was shooting a joke with someone else. So how did  that, S考 the few shots, I don't know about that attempt. Totally! Yes! And so we were right to the perspective of the night. Yes, didn't last throughout these months where I thought it was a big story. That night, yeah. Oh, have that, you're so cool. We got back to the neighborhood. She was very pumped that night. You should've seen her go. We didn't think a white chick could do that, but... Yeah, that's true. Do you think her do you it in? And trying that, I have crossed it on. Yeah. No. There's a point and I don't know where it all is. I sort of stopped to speak notes, stopped interviewing people, and just started started living with them and just, , and not being someone who's started to know. And then you think about it, , what? What happened? I guess I just thought everything. things can be used to an end that the more time I spent them, I would eventually have that mood. You can't expect to find these other deep-of-game experiences in one way. It's interesting because the way we're saying is that you expect to get this just sort of hanging around. This is the real game life. The real game life is still those fights and shootings which are about to happen. So it's something that at some work, that I'm going to be. the so-inside that they take me to that, not realizing that the actual gang life is actually just hangover in the street. Gospin, but who is the star of mine? Insight, Insight. It's inviting about who should have done. Who else who turned on us and who suffered his boyfriend? Before you tell it's the situation, what did you think of your female girlfriend? I thought it would be  a similar much more creamy fight. I would see big gang fights. , not  the jets or anything. I said story, but I really thought that I would see groups of people fighting each other. And they've heard numerous stories about these types of fights, but I never saw them. And I was so familiar with my initial interviews. The story is actually one of these moments. But I would see that I never saw anyone get hurt. I saw a drive by shooting blocks away. A car driving by and shooting at. I'm hurt. I'm saying this  this. , , I didn't see this over and you came back. I thought it was not to see. And is that because it wasn't actually going on? Well, yes. At least in this particular. and it's about business, it's about what, and tell drugs, who it, who, the selling drugs is, seeing some drugs is, it's a, I guess I became, sort of blase about it as, everyone else over me. To be honest, someone who juste bab la glass If I had time, I would've saved if I had a problem in speaking, more often we already had a stomach disorder. that you have fetishized season fetishimes. What would be so interesting? Yeah. To talk to you. Yeah. When it made really great anecdotes, you can go up straight for it. It is. It's also very serious. I think they  it. And well, they, , even though they just sort of hang out, and they're stuck, drugs here and there, they still know what it's  to. Supervisor, kind of boyfriend, dead, apart. Death is not as rude. Listen. Is it your impression that FFs is also in through their hearts? Yes. How do they say? I believe their perception of themselves. They see it as very, , the life, the world, , , you don't. You have to live the life to know the life. It's very, very hard place to be. and when they wouldn't rather be, it wouldn't be any worse. In their mind, is it just glamorous, criminal outside of it? Oh yeah. , but it's the life that you're waiting, the life that you're actually waiting for, the life that you tell yourself. For me, the time is... Well, and for now. But I mean, ... I think it's easy to make that. sounds to the silly but but I have to say I mean there are a lot of people then while I feel  living or that's that's different than what's actually half I mean I thought I thought I still do think that I have the greatest job in the world when I did the story if I can do this if I can hang out if I can become somebody else First summer Great baking I'm K-J. K-J. K-J. me. Why program today is about what happens when you try to turn yourself into the real thing, some notion of the real thing, an idea which is always a kind of fiction, kind of cliche. But in our area, as a professor at Boston University, he's written a fair amount about black people trying to define what it is to be a real black person. He does not  the idea of cultural uniformity. I remember once, actually defending the notion that if a black person likes, possibly still is national, then that is still a black thing to do. Black person is doing it. He rejects kind of rigid cultural funding as I say. But recently had this experience. Oh, this was in suburban South suburban Boston. We were walking in the forest reserves around here. I saw some of the men acting at the same time. And , just to get out and find something to do, so we driven into the forest and parked, we just walked in the walk. And yeah, we're still going on this. frozen lake and there were guys out there playing hockey and my son who at the time was probably three or four years old was really interesting and what was going on in the sky. squealing and just straining to get away from me but right out on the ice and going to the bottom line and all I could think about was  all of these guys are white. They were all . New England guys who  play hockey and I didn't want my son out there I don't know, they didn't know ,  ask the boss I respect him Some of those things die are even even when I had this intellectual position rejecting that kind of position of culture and among the snake blackness. Still when it came down by a kid. What is enthusiasm in me? I had rather broken. I was a little bit uncomfortable and I couldn't get a glass of wine. I was not going to sell science a garden. Sadly my kid is growing up on the south side of the bus. John Simkins wrote that what's his answer to that? We get it right now. Just head in here. On the spot 6,000. When I was in college, I was in Harvard, and other black students were very different than the black in there. The students who worked for small towns had this very definite image of blackness and that meant to me. And in most cases, that image was rooted more in Western Africa, in Africa, in general, instead of the South. I thought the ironic thing was that students who worked from the South tended to be their home. down upon the South, my name, my name, my planet, one of the huge southern cities. Anyone who was in many of those areas, and the sort of food was being come back. And if you was at almost in the 30th place, I think they viewed it as being a columnist of the South, there was an embrace of this sort of radical black nationalism, at least the words. that, , it's very little action to them. What are their patterns? They look. Most of them tended to be from cities, mostly northern cities. A lot of them were, at least in mine, really well-off, or similar to us. And as far as you were concerned, was it that the sense of identity, it wasn't hopeless entertainer, but that's being developed, which is happening. and we were growing up in the South and the South Carolina. Right, we did live in a community where we were only black family on this block. Now the school that our boys go to is thoroughly integrating school. 25% of the student body is Japanese speaking. But the kind of close net, it's all in. and the comprehensive and clear and intense and the whole world. And yet, we think the issue of race is sufficiently important. We want them to be able to feel accustomed with their racial identity. To be able to, , not have to get to be 18 years old and then go off to college. And all of a sudden, determined that they're gonna have to find out what this blackness is about. That was one of them in the state of it. there was this attitude of hip radicalism and embrace by people who really had an experienced what it meant to be on the other side. They have said being growing up either whether in the city or even in a small town in a lower middle class or lower class. And to give you a lot of this is just a pose. I've seen a lot of it as a pose. I thought that. There was little opportunity to discuss or the range of what it meant to be black person in America. One of the things that my wife and I live most in fear of is that we're having the collected attention to this question earlier in the children's life. We were then rebelled later on in the lab center some kind of formulaic blackness that still did a ajudar. , we want them to think you can learn the Japanese language or Arabic language that you can learn to play the cello and still be black. There's nothing. Unblack, red clue about needles actually. Is there a part of you what we thought you're teaching a missing something by not growing up in the secondary school? Yeah, they're missing something. something but it's okay. This is the way of world. There are benefits and there are costs and I think the cost of what benefits and kind of the sign. I'll kid you take a lot of stuff and they just assume the world is there waste. They don't have to overcome some barriers and make some discovery. they take it's grand, they're with it's awesome and I know I think that kind of sensibility can be fostered in living and in ghetto it's very clear that everything is not possible for me that's why it's again a lot of them work in the house and in a few cases that are even kids who got to the best stages of the research. Exeter and M.D. So that sort, who came to college and it served people, what I found interesting, except that college was over. They returned to this lifestyle with the internet, that little thing. It's been really good. This is a lot, this is what a lot of the, this particular situation is here you It's actually during the 60s when a lot of white students move their school and they experimented. They left and took jobs in the port of work where a lot of people say they sold out. I don't even think about that since I'm too expert. The same things happen with it. Black students are hard, there is a lot of posture. So heavily, we've got to sound some time. But, really what's the relevant role in those are the same students who teach arts in that school. And we can also do that business. So, so there's a sort of power to act with some of the students. But, as you go, hi, Ediths. And there's the identity state that's going to be identity state. And then we start to interact. I love that my voice will be black and waves so very different from that characterized my own life and that my thinking now is that the best things that they wear that racial identity right not that they be indifferent to their black and some shame that they wore. look at it as and it relives. But that, , I hope that they would be able to be lacking the way that each thing flexing on the adaptable, open and not妥ekier in narrow. Coming up, man calls Robert and you're a chicken to his face. No. Everyone can say this, but it's so kind of interesting. That's in a minute. But public rating international. They're not program. To some American life in my class, each week I'm probably going to post a few things in theme. To write it, kinds of people to tackle that theme, to write different kinds of stories. Today's program, real thing. So, raise the people trying to live up to some ideal, or refusing to. We've arrived. Direct 3 of our program, Act 3, DL all. There are tens of millions of real southerners in this country. Shopping at Munga's table just  you and me, my friend. But one industry does not seem to notice their reality. But Mark Shoney is a 7x patriot who has no sense. Why? Since we've been locked out in each other all these past nine years, I have developed a bit of short-end. If one of us says something new, there is so many times before the tears in board. of love, and victim has the right to create things. The victim says that's on the tape, as in that's on you are tape. The list of stories and obsessions you've rewound so often I can sing along with an enracee. But if relying on the queen size at night watching TV and chance on some misbegotten suit or dropped arms and fake balls, it's supposed to be a southern accent, my tape starts jumping. It must be heard. I must, look. leg arm. My wife says tape and we change the gym. For me, all that is cornball and not movie southern actions, all that is fake is embodied by that would be Mac daddy of the farm yard, the animated chicken known as spot-born leg. He was conceived as a parody of a Gentile, old South cliché as your movies and what not doing. He was a prening daddy in school. the ladies. Go away, boy, you're a bollock! I got work to do! The late legendary Mountblank didn't try and do an action-assignation. You better not say you better keep a shot! Boy, I know you can. He was spread then being a Martian and a pretty tough and flea-bird. And this was a satisfying and big white roostie. It wasn't about sounding mean. 60 years later, though, actors are still speaking talking and they think it is with. I'm an authority of seven actions because I'm a typical rootless model. Meaning I was born outside the South, just  New English and Dick farming, and moved this kid with my Midwestern parents to a brand new sub-vision shop that had a swamp in Southeast Asian region. A babysitter taught me what the all-mechanical number was seven years old. In high school my rebellion against my little college professor Dad was to hang out and drug demonians. I've been burdened backseat and wear a place between my classes and a drug back. grows in my mouth grow out, swirving through the swamp fog that eyes closed and giggling. But as long as they look and talk  Alan Collins of Leonard Skinner, as long as they have that mean, feral glamour, I thought they were cool. I talked  them on purpose. It thrilled me when I died my school bus granted. Groundhog? My mom would don't need it when we're ready to do. I went to college, thousand miles away. Nashville and heard a stronger, tiny and absent in the coast of Burma and grew up in and moved to Georgia for a few more years of season. By the time I left the South I had a pretty good grasp of the range regional dynamics. And I knew that the movie said them all commonly known. I would argue that nearly every valve comes out of nearly every actor's mouth as well. But for outsiders here are the easiest problems to spot. Let's take the unforgivable life. This testimony, makes Black women familiar so that's not a stage. 16, 9, 4, you were against and sexual congress at the finish? Well, maybe that's too easy. How about someone who has never actually turned down a strip  Dan Akon? He played the son in driving this name. I'm afraid that my loss up here, my game down here, I've given me an error of competence, I don't really possess. Even inside all the other things wrong with this way, far from somewhere. Very few white people in South Stoke. They say here, not here. The linguists at the University of Georgia told me, if you want to find somebody with that old plantation accident, you're talking about people 75 years old. Friend and Atlanta was more than fact. Those people are dead. Before they died, they were rich, or they lived in the coastal or peabot areas in the south. Up in the hills, they always said their own house. And now in the age of seven hours, TV again, the air conditioner has some good gloves in her mouth. He was  me, he didn't ink. Really everyone there written sounds, so. Especially when there was none fit. You say, oh. That's him too. Hi name's Forrest. Forrest gone. My mom always said, The life was lack of boxes, chalklets. There are two kinds of eyes. The eye sound in word  life. night and nice is different from the eye and vibe and vibe and time. Real Saturdays make a distinction between the girls. My experience in three states in the twenty years is that they said life and they said time. Life time. Not, not time. Not many people said laugh or laugh. If they did, they were considered hillbills. In fact, they almost always really did anything happen when it should. Or maybe a party would down in these texts. Random movies. Even a kid from the final big column Alabama hung Parston says laugh is laugh and rocks and jerks. The laugh is laugh and box and chalk, let's. Lesson 3. The sound is really big. People from Savannah and the coal fields and the bayou, they'll talk to soon. They're not usually in the same room unless they're on vacation in Florida, which is another part of the sound. But in the movies, people with radically different options. and it's turned out to be another dollar from lifelong years. Listen to the way dolly part and Sally Fields and Jilly Roberts pronounce color, instead of Magnum's. The fields are supposed to be Robert's mother. But do you color shelled? My colors are pink and pink. My colors are blush and natural. Once upon a time I couldn't figure out why the actors and directors in the art didn't spend any time listening to actually a sudden talk because they did. They learned very quick. they have farmed film dilatated, drifted from reality. But after I moved to New York, I realized that I was just living in Hixen. This time they were urbanists and world outside their hall, which was one big movie scene. South was a movie. If you went there, you spoke a language invented by a British woman in Vivian Man, also known as Charlotte of Manch, with an assist by New Jersey's Rod Stuyer as the racist sheriff. The San Francisco's milk wank was not a pity chick. South is a cartoon. I admit, the natives played along. They scammed the hitch by selling more and more preposterous stories about white columns and crazy aunts in the end. They cooked up as much Gothic kits as the market would bear. Guy from St. Louis renamed himself Tennessee and made a myth. It was a great racket, but it meant that seveners never really saw themselves on the screen. They still do. A second time, wat rolled up with a world that was still alive. ThreeHaughty would sixty-four percent of the history of the chosen錯ifying the law and weapons of some of the existing We succeed in that twofold outer world as it had evolved and How's that? How you? It was a remake of Cape Fear that gave me my mom's clarity. I honkered in a Manhattan multiplex posture. Robert Jeneer was trying to impersonate a dirty eating sikon. And yes, it was nuts. They're not the way Jeneer intended. Man, come out wherever you are. New York, MOOC was bumping up his with Cagin and Caroline. It was the worst thing I'd ever heard. I rolled in it  a happy duck. talking to something dead. It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than it, Jasper. Prove your better way! When it was over in the credits drifted past, I locked onto the one that read dialectic coach. Now I knew. After that, every time Foghorn turned up in a movie, I checked to see who is dialectic coach. Every sudden extra time, I came out of Cape Fear gone, huh? The man taught in the era of the sound, I can happily. It's interesting, it's so proud, he dragged it out. I would see his ads and show his trade papers and get all this. To Robert De Niro, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Well, my name is Sam Schwann. I'm Director of New York Speech Proof and Services, where the largest company of licensed speech therapists in this country, where the largest company of licensed speech therapists in the United States, specializing in accident acquisition and accident elimination. I dropped in on Schwad, as Manhattan offices, who had boxes to celebrity jobs filled on him a form. He was born and raised in Brooklyn speaking the English, and he's never lived more than an hour from Grand Sopher, but he has a master's in speech in 20 years of experience in her existence. The first he specialized in moving him, then he started doing implants. I trained Robert De Niro to do an Appalachian ex for Cape Fear Leonardo DiCaprio, New York accent, basketball diaries, Julia Roberts and Andy McDowell lost their southern accents with me before their film careers began. El Mithiris and Kathleen Turner, Benjamin Brad, of Wide variety. What would you say you're best at? I suppose my Italian is alright, ? Italian itself is not so good, ? But... I do everything good, it's ugly. His mother actually was every bit of excuse. He told me he had a whole posse of relatives down the suban who taught him the local name. He demonstrated. It depends on the sort of southern accent you're talking about. If there's sort of an App late, sort of accent, it's one that I've taught many many times. Periscale was correct. broad-based one more indicative of say the deep-saf where the odds disappear after the vowel let's say which is Hollywood's southern in a nutshell. So a people in movies talk not people in real life. I told Shwai I'd never met anyone and spoke with the fingers calling it so nice. I pointed out that the people who dropped their arms were not the same people as the ones who sent back. And now they're the arlas people. almost extinct anyway. He defended himself, he backpedaled, and often the stage signed. He told me I had a sensitive ear, but it doesn't take a sense in here. Listen to this clip from running his star clients. My daddy catches you here the question of whether or not I can carry your children with my dad. You'll think of it. That's Julia Roberts and still Magnongs. The language will tell you that in middle class 20 something in that town that received you and see you on the arms. She said, whether and you are and matter. A linguist told me that. But Shua has bought into the cartoon so completely. He thinks Shua works herself, he used to talk about me, and she was growing up in suburban Atlanta. He claims it back before she was a star when he helped her get rid of him, suddenly, actually. Here were the things he had in the fix. Pretty good variety, such substitutions. Of TN instead of TN. The Al at the Al. Droppingure after. he a they have more instead of a here there or more except of course she didn't talk that way if you want confirmation all you have to do is ask someone to do I've been a guy in the house where the camel has food for the one years I asked Richard F's and guidance counselor and her smartness or to high school who doesn't talk that way either she was a student here and she was a student aid and in our through the Now in the 20th, it's a beer 21st year, Kevin, in the 21 years he finished for my school. Right, have you had any white students drop for arms? I don't recall any of that at all. I don't recall any of the days through. How about Julia? Julia, have you ever dropped for arms? I don't recall any of that. And that's why Robert sounds so fake, can she drop? and stealing moments because she's never done anything. I guess what happened is that when she showed up on Saturn on the wheels, Burbys are all, it wasn't close enough to the cartoon for the powers that they did, and they sent for Schwann. It's  something out of the movie Hollywood shuffle. Some white guy telling a black actor, can you make that blacker? One reason Hollywood can't get Saturn right is that Saturn. on home still. The real south is changing. The real southern is go to models and need to be out of the island. Media tells them it's the way they speak to a place or a simple moment. So if they're the slightest bit I put them over and try not to sound too dangerous. Sometimes Hollywood does make a semi honest devil to keep free. Rob's in there, listen to real people speak from his home cake. The Senate's personal assistant, into a Southern prison, to take their views with inmates in the same age criminal record, and he'll be able to bonify his character in the script. He picked a tapey light and labored with Sam Schwaffer Weeks, and was in the case. Sometimes however, we'll be in town, technically, and flawless in the flesh and things. I am not going to let me. I'm as large as God. He is a... So much more with us. He came out of both me and Rana. Then he came back. So much just to eat new longsings. After? Right, a Mark Showney is a reporter living among the Yankees in New York City. I'll be not to run into a certain actor. But the other lacks them. Where I come from, the youngers call the country. The yakeies call them them. Back for real love. There's the real thing when it comes to your idea of which job you want, what house you want, the person you want to fall in love with. And until you find the real thing that you see, life is the same story over and over and over again. Either quite as comedy or tragedy. The story of missing the real thing yet again. When a real life shows Los Angeles right around the former San Francisco hotels it happened to her, and she signed up for a computer dating service, a folder of a lot. The name and its flight of sense. Robert Blair, 37. Sing. I look in a folder. And I can't believe it. Bye now. But one thing, unlike what you'd expect from the dating service, Robert Blair is really, really attractive. No, I mean really straight nose, clean jawline, smoldering blue eyes. We are talking, rave finds, rave finds who's basically dawned on a crew next sweater and is living a monos in the Southland. I turn the page, Robert Blair is an architect by profession. Time has been spent in Italy, interesting. food, opera, foreign movies, badminton, marital status, never my heart is pounding. My eyes are tearing up. Oh my God, I'm thinking, oh my God, and this panic is starting to seize me, not just the primary panic of having found the perfect man, but the secondary panic of knowing that other women are looking at this perfect man, and then the tertiary panic of realizing that I'm feeling this panic, and when you feel panic dates don't tend to... go well. Somehow the panic invades your face, causing these contortions to happen in the middle of some casual comment, would you  some happen half equal? Your face will split open in this demoness. And that is that you have done it, that terrible, unthinkable thing. You have pierced the dating membrane. That is the membrane that covers all dating people and keeps them safe from each other. As illustration takes fill up a perfect, most fearless bachelor I was privileged to date a few times. the type, successful, 36 year old film editor, or something. Great haircut, zippy, shugo boss, jacket. , one of those smart, funny, presentable man who formed that eerie hollow eye children of the corn failites across our care city. I love her. I love her. Hi, how are you? others of his eels of perfect. Philip package was coated with this impenetrable dating membrane to it. You were supposed to see Philip once a week at most twice a month, or two a week. But you were never to contact him in between. As though he was on sort of undercover spy to follow you Matt work was to trigger that bomb thing. And here Philip kept trying to train me in the new system. And I knew that I should get with it. I knew that it was. is the law of dating land. And then up in Aiden, follow it. I would lose my all important dating land. Citizenship. I wouldn't be allowed to go out on any more meaningless, unfun dates, such as these. So fill up what small squalvin next morning, handing me my delicious warm fresh pumpkin muffin to go. Call you in 10 days or so. 10 days, that's almost two weeks. I'd stay at that in alarm. Eyes wide. I'm out of town. He denunciates you do when telling a large watchhold eager lavador to sing. But you cannot remember how he repeated the command. I'm out of town, out of town, in ten days or so. I will call you. Okay, I'll call you. Really. Oh, I remember the drill. I repeatedly repeated the phrases he had taught me unnatural abs aerobics. Well, have a great time. Jeez, I've got a busy week to call me whatever. It is a new problem at all. But what's that going on? Just gonna stop. So there's a bug. You call me, I won't call you, no, no, no, no. Delivery became so broad, so Garrett. So, so drew an woolen. It's  a rarest tag in the woods,  perfect bachelor's degree scoop. And after ten days or so, they let did not call. But I'm not going to make that mistake tonight. Oh no. For once in my life, things are going to be different. For once in my life, I'm going to be... ...sight. The forest green door opens and there's... stands, Robert Lee, Chris Whitley, press Kathy's, tortoise shell ribs. Oh my God, I think feeling the force of gravity buckling my knees. Oh, is all I say? Robert, was perfect manners, Robert Blair shows me around his perfect place. We are talking cold, silks, Mexican paper towel, totally redone hardwoods. floors, you to track lighting, some zero fridge, even a utility sunroom with a pull out ironing board. We can almost hear a fire of angels sing a song. Sandra Roberts says behind me, would you  some champagne? And there stands Robert Lair with two leaning flutes of champagne and an Italian champagne it's surrounded. upon which he's arranged. Gorgonzola cheese, grapes, and English water crackers in a perfect thing. I am home! I find myself thinking, I am home! The Bistro Robert takes me to as a delightful intimate place, a glow with little candles. You  opera, I say. Yes, he says, I do. I feel mademal, waterfly is coming to the music center. I saw something about it in the lost and jealous times. Really, he says, did you? Then we couldn't know, to early retract. It's just such a great opera is all. I love it. Hello, opera. Butterflies all right he says for a war force American certainly insist on their favorites I sometimes think if I'm forced to sit through another bow and I'll scream yes I know what you need the opera world is all through egosky isn't it the smoldering blue eyes me mine flop yes I dare he says exhaust I think wait a minute. Well, relax, breathe. The guy works a 10 hour day. He went to the trouble of laying out English water crackers for you and that's perfect sand. It's not that he's not having fun. It's just that he's really really tongue. Now I can focus. In Roberts' Chitch was this really really fancy capuccino maker because capuccino What was his habit that's what he called him? I have it. I think that's what Robert Blair needs after dinner. Some caffeine, a lest. But the thing is we can't have it here. We can't have it in this restaurant, even though it's an Italian restaurant and a espresso machine's keep worrying, worrying, worrying around us because to prolong the date to kick things to that higher level, we need to move to a new venue to do a new activity. My God, it's barely eight, one piece in the guy is all nodding and looking at us, watching everybody have a cheat of! I say, right, Lee, I guess you make a mean cabinet, huh? Well, he says, but then that's ugly clothes, expression crosses his face. He pushes up his glasses. Well, no. But you're machine, I say, in your kitchen. It doesn't work. He says it's a properly. It doesn't work? No, no, it is not that it does not work. It is just that it needs a new filter, a new water filter. You don't just use that filter to water from the white reader, jumping thing in your sub-zero free-ish. Well, you could. but it is just not good. Well, I have a little camera, , I forged on hacking through the dense rubbery foliage with my cinemataur. And you must be missing it if you can, and I know I'm missing when I can't make them at home, even when I take a pic of it, you would know that, look at it, and it's gonna get agitated. Why don't we go to a great camera, to you, Brian, just a short while from here in La Breia. Clutching is our, my hand,  a pinion. I see myself reflected in Robert Blair's perfect tortoise shell glasses. I'm asked, Eira is raccoonie here. I'll frighten you. I'll come to my date, dress  a high. And I cannot stop talking. It was fun. Robert Blair says giving me a quick pick on the cheek at the door. Sorry about having to bail early. It's just that I'm really really tight. Thank you. The forest green door shuts behind him, blocks. There are footballs. A moment later, a light goes on upstairs. At moment, I realize that Robert Blair is completely happy behind that curtain, alone in the perfect palace he took such great pains and showing me. He is probably neting about in boyish, stuck in feet. On his perfectly appointed couches, love seats and pillows. Growing his arms up, chumanant, free of the burden of me. It makes me furious. I begin to shake at the iron rods of the loft gate, shake them with all my mind. I'm not done with this evening, I yell, I'm not done! You don't even have to talk to me. We don't even have to see each other again. But I want that power of how much he know. I want it! But there's no answer. After a moment, ever so distantly behind double pains of glass, I hear it. The rattle of a paper pop open of a court and inevitably, the gentle murmurings of CNN. Well, I win the monster to the great and promised.
