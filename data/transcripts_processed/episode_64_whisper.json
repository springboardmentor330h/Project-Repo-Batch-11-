  "text": "Memorial Day was an easy featureway. Her mom's birthday was May 31st and her mom officially declared the period between Mother's Day. She was the son of a man. And her birthday would be known in the family as Galatine, which named basically. It would be the one time during the year for Mom, but get whatever she wanted. Which wouldn't have been fun. Except what mom all of a one it was a road trip into the mountains or curvy roads. Which didn't match Julie's personal. a child, enjoy this clip. A peep, every word, and always. A peep that every road trip from, a peep at any time we're in the car for a while, and then  a half an hour from the age of four to the age of 12. I mean, I used to be, yeah, so direct up on drama mean. I didn't really ever experience my summer vacations. See that again? This will attract up on drama mean. You would be. Yeah. Oh yeah, did you wouldn't even experience an education? You just say, I would just feel a glassy-eyed and I just kind of sweaty. And I remember we went, it was a whole trip of  the Northwest and Canada and coming down the coast. And I didn't see anything. I don't remember anything. I don't remember. Glacier, I don't remember Yellowstone. I don't remember if I remember anything. For three weeks I just dropped. Wigs... for one day and that one day I threw up into my mom from the back on it. She thought I was gonna be addicted to drama me? But then she was more scared to the throught than a day. power threw up all over the car. oh my brother had  two pairs of shoes right in front of me and I threw up  one in each shoe. So he had to wear a pair of  dress shoes that you have  Nike's and I threw up in my brother's baseball card collection that was also on the floor and trying to meet it from brother. Well, this is the week of Memorial Day. And the thing about Memorial Day, and the beginning of summer, is that every person, every family, has its Achilles heel when some funnily arise. If it's not the one person who gets sick in the car, it's the person who hates the sun. If one who can't stand the beach, the person who loves the beach loves it so hard, so fiercely, so thoroughly that no one else in the family can understand it. It's a promise of summer. Hope we have all things getting easier of more fun, more free time. And then there's a reality of all we have to do and make summer with her to its potential. But didn't they go and start all that little bags or something? Well, yeah, no, my brothers did. Actually, we were  two and a half weeks into this road trip that we took. They decided that, obviously, we're going to have putrails and  that they would just, , that we need to . prepare for them and stuff  an Olympic team. And so  they strategically placed plastic and paper bags all over the place, but also had  this blanket that they had set up that you could put pull out. And it would mean  drape across my lap because I had a problem controlling where it went as well. And also then somebody was  in charge of opening all the windows and the other person was  in charge of keeping me off their stuff. And it is what But no, no. Hey, oh, yeah, it's chaos when it happens. I could never, because that was a problem with I could never give ample enough warning to really set the whole thing emotion. Because I'd be threatening to do it for  three hours and then I would just stop paying attention to me and then all of a sudden it would just happen. Definitely meant, any sort of efficient force produced past Yes, no, I hate something. You actually hate something. Oh, that's cool. Because of expectations that you're supposed to have a good time, ?  that you're supposed to have  your life as a kind of Pepsi commercial or something. And it's supposed to have this great time in your spaces because the weather's nice just supposed to go to the beach and because the weather's nice, supposed to go out to our concerts and have fun and be happy all the time and you're not supposed to set in your house and watch TV because and get absolutely out. It's just terrible. I need to go to a boyfriend and you're a girlfriend and you're an awful terrible time of the year. Nobody wants you to be happy in the winter. You have no pressure to be happy. You can just be whatever you want. You can totally justify being depressed. But in the summer, it's awful. Everyone wants you to be all happy and then you just feel a loser. You're not even really that depressed about anything we're taking other than the fact that you just , I kind of just feel  a loser. The way you're describing it, summer is just It's  a three month long prom date where you're supposed to go and have a good time, but nobody ever does. Exactly. I think that's exactly what summer is. There's exactly. You feel  such a sucker, but you can't really get out of it. Well, from WB's Chicago, it's a American life in my request. Today on our program, Memorial Day here, show up at the Poms of Summer. This hour on our show, we're going to try something. different. Usually those who are familiar with the show know that we will choose one theme and bring you a variety of all different kinds of stories over the course of the hour. Today we're going to hear two stories interlaced throughout the hour. One from Mount Carlson, one from Scott Carrier, will hear those stories in a minute. But first, a little comedy bounds. Who cares, Lordy does, since you brought my heart Who loves the wind Who cares that it makes reasons Who cares, Lordy does, since you brought my heart Who loves the sun Who loves the sun? Papa, Papa, Papa, Now everyone! Papa, Papa, Papa, Who loves the sun? Well, at one end too. Most of our ideas about the start of summer come from school from that moment when we look at at a school in May or June, feel that flush of freedom. Even as adults, I think we yearn for that healing to hit us again, come Memorial Day, come the start of summer. The first of these two stories is that we'll be hearing interlaced throughout the hour, this is my long crossing, a story of somebody on Summer Break in college. From across the Missouri to the Missouri. In 1967, the year before the year, the finally cracked in 20th century, once and for all, I had as my summer job delivering medical... oxygen in Phoenix, Arizona. I was a sophomore at the University of Montana in Zula, but my parents lived in Phoenix, and my father was a well-engineer, used his contacts to give me a job at Erin Oxygen Company. I started there doing what I called dumbbell maintenance. It kind of make work that's assigned to college kids. I cleared debris from the backlog, mainly crushed packing grades. These were good days for me. I was 19 years old and this was the hardest work. I've tried everything. The days were stunning, starting hot, growing and insistent and hotter. My first week, two of the days, been 160. And in that first week, I learned what not to touch, where not to stand, and I found the powerhouse heat simply bracing. I lost some of the winter dormitory fat and could feel myself browning and getting into shakes. Please . I was having a hard ride through the one relationship I had begun during the school year. Her name was Linda Enripe, the classmate, and we had made the mistake of sleeping together that spring. Just once , but it wrecked absolutely everything. We were dreaming beforehand, kind of couple who walked real close, bumping for him. We read each other's papers. I'm not making this up. We read poetry on the library long, under a tree. And then one night in her dorm room we went ahead with it, squirming out of our clothing under hard dead. When we did something for about a minute, we changed everything. After that we weren't even the same people. She wasn't she and I wasn't her. We were two young citizens in the wrong country. All I could remember from the incident itself was Linda stopping once and undoing my belt and saying, here, I'll get it. The coolness of that practice. Frays repeated in my mind after I had said goodbye to him and she got off the boulder where her summer job was working in her parents' cookie shop. I called her every Sunday from a payphone at an ex-on station on Indian school road and we'd fight. And if you asked me what we thought about, I couldn't tell you. We both felt misunderstood. Runtcolson? Let's start the second. This is a very different time of summer. Once that's side of the danger. It's got a carrier. Everything is distributed in this room, but it's not just new down the green room. I have to confess that profound ignorance about what I'm doing. My preparation for this blood trip consisted of buying a canoe, and then grabbing a Wyoming Roadmap movie. I've been in a canoe a couple of times and I thought I knew how to make it turn and go straight. And I'd seen the river from several bridges across the other trips in other years. And it was always wide and calm and flat. So I thought I could manage well enough. I could have practiced with the canoe. Gone out with someone who could show me the strokes. And I could have read up on the river, learned about what was in store for me. But I chose not to do these things. When you try. try to lay things out, try to control what's going to happen. You always end up disappointed or frustrated, at least I do. My first surprise has been that the river at the top was not calm and flat. Give a rabbit's big rabbits. I floated down and can't where I first heard the roar, it sounded  this. This sound was carried on the wind. my tan off and off to the night, and it rained with light heat and thunder. I got up with the sun, legs and coffee, and compared the worst. I double and triple wrapped everything in garbage bags and tied it all into the canoe, and then I took off my clothes. It would be easier to swim naked, and if I was to drown, I wanted for some reason to drown naked. I started down the river praying for all the hands I'd ever stepped on, for all the bugs that it splattered into my windshield, I prayed for dirt and discarded things, I prayed for all my forgotten memories. And somehow I made it, a canoe kept filling with water, but it stayed upright, and I got away with only a couple of wells on my shoes. Two weeks into the summer, I was drafted to drive one of the two medical oxygen trucks. One of the drivers should quit, and our foreman came out on the dock in the morning and told me to see Nadine who ran medical and her little off. office building out front. They had the truck loaded. Two groups of ten medical blue cylinders chain hitched into the front of the bed. These tanks were going to be in people's bedrooms. I climbed in the truck and started pulled on a Macdowl and headed for Sun City. But that time Sun City was set alone in the desert. A weird theme park for retired white people. And from the beginning. gave me an eerie feeling. The streets were  toy streets, narrowed clean, running in large circles. No cars, no garage doors open, and of course in the heat, no pedestrians. These people had come here from the Midwest and the East. They had been doctors and professors and lawyers, and wanted to live among their own kind. No 120 could reside in Sun City. Mr. Rensedale was the first of my customers I ever signed bad. I rang the bell and was met by young woman in a long silk shirt, saw me and said, oh yeah, come on in. I had the hot blue cylinder on the single dial and pulled it up the step and into the dark cool space. I had my pocket rag and wiped the wheels as soon as she shut the door. I pointed down the hall. Is it this way? No, upstairs. first store on your right. He's awake. David. She said my name just the way you read names off shirts. Then she put her hand on my sleeve and said, who hit you? My old scar was still raw across my cheekbone. I got burned. Cute, she said. They're going to love that back at where? University of Montana. University of Watchy said. Has the university there? She smiled. I'm... kidding I'm a snop but I'm kidding what year are you I'll be a junior I said I am a senior at Penn she said I nodded my mind whipping around for something clever I didn't even know where Penn was great I said I started up the stairs Yeah, she said great I drew the dolly of the carpeted stare carefully and entered the bedroom. It was dim in there but I could see the other cylinder beside the bed and a man in the bed gwagged. He was wearing pajamas and immediately upon seeing me said, ''Good, open the blinds will you?'' He said, ''Sure thing I said, and I went around the bed and turned them in a blind wand. The air is on a day fell into the room. The young woman I'd spoken to walked out to the cool beneath me. She took off her shirt and hung it up. one of the chairs. Her breasts were white and sunlight. She set out her magazine and drink by one of the lounges and lay face down on shiny green bikini bottom. I only looked for a second or less, but I could feel the image in that bottom. While I was disconnecting the regulator from the old tank and setting up the new ones. Just your rentsdale introduced. himself. He was a thin handsome man, dark hair and mustache, and he looked  about three or four of the actors I was seeing those nights in late movies after my parents went to bed. I liked him immediately. What feel are you in, I asked him? He seemed so absolutely worldly there, his rye eyes and his east coast accent, and he seemed old the way people did them, but I realized now he wasn't 50. I lads of the owner of Rensdale found a... which my father founded, his whisper was rich with humor. He made ladies undergarments, lots of them. The dolly was loaded, now is ready to go. Come after four next time, if it's worth a martini to you kid, and we'll do some career counseling. Give me a thin smile and I left. Letting myself out of the dark downstairs, I did an odd thing. I stood still in the house. I had talked to her right here. I saw her breasts again in the bright light. No one knew where I was. The next house was an old black home gone to see. The long dirt and shrubs dead. The windows brown with dust and cobwebs. I was fairly sure I had a wrong address. that the property was abandoned. I knocked on the greasy door and after five minutes the stooped red-haired old man answered. This was skill and I have no idea how old he was that summer, but it was as old as you get. His skin stretched tight and translucent on his gone to body was slattered with brown spots. On his hand several had been picked raw. I pulled my doll into the house in the set by the world. a link smell of dog here and here and I didn't kneel to wipe the wheels. Right in here the old man said, leading me back into the house, toward a yellow light in the small kitchen where I could hear a radio chattering. He had his oxygen set up in the corner of the kitchen. It looked  he lived in the one room. There was a fur of fine red dust on everything. The range and sink. Except half the kitchen table where he had his things arranged. I got this. is the changing out the tanks. Meanwhile, the old man sat down with a kitchen table and started talking. I'm Gil Benson, his speech began, and I'm glad to see you, David. My lungs got burned in France in 1919, and it took 20 years to buckle. You spoke  so many of my customers in a horse whisper. I've lived all over the world including three A's, Africa, Australia, and Alaska. My favorite place was Montreal, Canada, because I was in love there at married to women, at children. My least favorite place is right here because of this. One of my closest friends was Jack Cramer, the tennis player. That was many years ago. I flown every plane made between the years 1928 and 1948. I don't fly anymore with all this. The indicated the oxygen equipment. Sit down, have a cookie. I had my dolly ready. I shouldn't say I said I've got a schedule and better keep it. Grab that picture out of the fridge before he said down I made a some cool aid. It's good. I opened his refrigerator. Except for the top of our picture, it was empty. Nothing. I put the picture on the table. I really have to go I said I'll be late. Sit down he said this is your last stop today. Have a snack. So began my visits with the old Gil Benson. He was my last delivery every fourth day that summer, and as far as I could tell, I was the only one to visit his rich at house. On one occasion, I placed one of the Oreos he gave me, on the corner of my chairs I left, and it was there next time when I returned. Our visits became little three-part crommas, my arrival in the bus. of intrusion, the snack in his monologue, his hysteria and weeping. I had I got to go all over my face, but he would never read it. It always started with the story of long ago, an airplane, a homemade repair, an emergency landing, an odd coincidence. Each part told with pride, but his voice would gradually change, slide into a kind of wine as it began in escalating series of complaints about his doctors. The intro. insurance. His children, naming each of the four, relating their indifference, petty greed or cruelty . I nodded through all of this. I've got to go. I'd slide my chair back and he grab my wrist. By then I could understand his children pushing him away and moving out of stays. I wanted out. It's been easy floating in past couple of days, but the river lines back and forth in these big long esters. Sometimes I paddle maybe 10 miles to cover just once the curl flies. Yesterday at sunset after a long hot day, I pulled out a camp and grass and fear. I could see a ranch house about a mile in distance, so the thought of being in private property did cross my mind. But  I said, the house was a mile away and it was late. This morning I enzyptate and the grass was covered with frost, my shoes which I left outside were frozen stiff. I got up slowly and just... laid around until 10 or 11 looking at the sea rooms. I saw moose and beaver, bald eagles, sand hill cranes, and many little birds I don't know by name. There was a little one in the willows by the river, and it was bright orange and yellow, a pear key you might die in a pet store. So I was lying around thinking what a great place it was when a truck drove up and parked on a dirt road about a quarter mile away. To man branch form checked av標 for plastic checked vessels came over to chew me out. Miss Kellon called and asked me to come down. Please ask you to leave which I have. The Kellons make their living or the operation of this ranch comes from selling, hey, that you're laying on right now that the ground that you've knocked down, this side of the river will be, is there a gate right now? I mean, you can look out there just ten feet away from you. There's water. Is there a gate and it's trying to put this up? It's hey. Thank you, Mr Anneыш. I've come on to trust passing. Yes, we do. And at specific times of the year, how I'm 100 in a fish and I  to go, and when I get the time to hunt and fish myself, but these people have paid a specific amount of money, and it's a large amount of money. They pay a large amount of taxes every year on this job, and it's their right to say who comes and who go. is on that property. Why do you have to come here? There's ground up there too for the public. I mean, the whole, some of the green river lakes, there's millions and millions of acres of public ground, of national forests of state, of state, where why do you have to come on this specific piece of ground? Well, how long will it stay, nice, how long will it continue to live nice? If everybody comes down and I'm not quite in the finger true for this. 10 people come to here at 9 o'clock late weekend, 3 o'clock, every day, and I are built different fires, and the fire is here, how long will this look melt? You just gotta drop a line, someone. I apologize for my trespass, and was quickly back on the river, paddles through some of the most beautiful country I've ever seen, keeping my eye on both banks, the two lines and with cross again until sometime after dark. By mid-July I become tight and sit. I look  a young boxer and I tried not to think about anything. Coming up to the loading dog later on. days with the truck of empties, I was full of animal happiness, and I moved with the measured deliberation the full day had given me. When I bent to the metal fountain beside the dock, gulping the water, I could feel a bloom on my back in my chest and come out along my hair line. Around this time a terrible thing happened in my phone correspondence with the enderite. You stopped fighting. We talked about our family, the cookie business was taking up. but her father wouldn't let her take the car and extend you. I told her about my deliveries. They hinted. As I listened to his talk, I stood and wondered, who are these people? The other me wanted to interrupt, to ask, hey, didn't we have sex? I mean, was that sexual intercourse? Isn't the world a little different for you now? But I chatted with her. When the operator came on, I was crazy. and London's indifference, but unable to say anything, but take care, long call. Meanwhile, the summer assumed a regularity that was nothing but comforted. I drove my roots. I was used to sitting with Gil Benson and hearing his stories. Pocket in the Oreo's secret, we'd throw them from the truck later. I was used to a Elizabeth of France. I was still showing me her white breasts, posturing by the pool whenever she knew I was upstairs with her father. Driving the valley those long summer days, each window of the truck of furnace, listening to paperback writer and last-trained Clarksville, I delivered oxygen to the paralyzed and dying. I felt so alive and on edge every moment that I could have burst. I'd light the truck, hopping up, unloading the hot cylinders at each address, and then driving to the next stop. up, I knew what I was doing and wanted no more. Rain broke the summer. The second week in August I woke to the first clouds in 90 days. They masked and thickened and by the time I left Sun City, it had begun, a crashing down another warrior MA! I didn't want to be late at the rent stales. I was wiping down the tank and the covered entry, when Elizabeth opened the door and disappeared back into the dark house. I was wet from the warm rain and coming into the air-conditioned house ran a chill along my sides. On my eyes adjusted, and I started backing up the stairway with a new cylinder, I saw Elizabeth sitting on the couch, in the dam, her knees together up under her chin, watching me. She was looking right up. This is the worst summer of my entire life she said. Sorry I said coming down the step, would you say? David, is that you? Mr. Renzdale called from his room. His voice was a ghost. I liked him very much, and it had become clear over the summer that he was not going back to Pennsylvania. Elizabeth Renzdale whispered across the room to me. I don't want to be here. She closed her eyes and rocked her head. I stood the cylinder on the dialing went over to her. I didn't  leaving it there on the carpet. She was sitting in her underpants on the couch. He's dying, she said to me. Oh, I said, trying to make it simply a placeholder. Let her know I'd heard her. She put her face in her hands and lay over on the couch. I dropped to a knee and put my hand on her shoulder. I said, what can I do? This was the secret sign that I had suspected from this summer. Elizabeth Rendsdale put her hand on mine and turned her face to mine, so slowly that I felt my heart dropping gear. Grinding now heavily uphill in my chest. Mr. Rendsdale called my name again. Elizabeth's face on mine, so close, and open, made it possible for me to move my hand around her back and pull her to me. It was  I knew what I was doing. I didn't take my eyes from hers when she rolled onto her back and guided me on her. I wish I could get this right here, but there was no chance. We stayed together for a moment afterward, and my eyes opened and focused. She was still looking at me, holding me, and her look was simply serious. Her father called, David, from upstairs again, and I realized he must have been called steadily. Mr. Renn'sdale, they white and twisted in the bed. He looked the way the dying look, and faced partched in sunken, the mouth of the dry orifice, his eyes little spots in water. I saw him acknowledge me. with the weathering look, more power than you think could rise from such a body, and I moved in the room to liberate with shame, avoiding the size. He rolled his hand in a little flip toward the bed table, and his glass of water. Who knows what happened in New Then? Because I stood in the little bedroom with Mr. Rennstale, and then I just rolled the dolly in the expired tank out and downstairs. I didn't go to him. I didn't hand in the glass of water. I'd burn. Who would ever know what I had done? Sandwash is way out in the Utah desert. You drive two and a half hours on a dirt road, and when you get there, it's a big king. But dry wash cutting down through shillstone badlands and empty into the green river. The river at this point is slow and flat. The color of coffee is milk and just about as warm. If you stand by the river you might see a great blue hair, a pair of golden eagles, a beaver and a otter. The rivers at thin snake  oasis. But if you turn away from the water back up to cliffs and bear in the plateau, you might think you're now. I'm gonna dry. God forbid. a supplier. It's just that you taught Desk, close to where Rubin bar buried his cat, close to nowhere. This Desk is controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. They manage the grazing currents, and they give out 10,000 floating currents every year to people who want to make the six or seven day trip down through Desk Lation Canyon. There's a BLM Ranger station there where you put your boat in water. Her name is Michelle Ster. She's six feet She checks your equipment, first aid kit, extra paddles, life check. She checks her arm, doesn't give you our turn. And it sees it as sees she's not from around here. This is on some kind of leave of absence, hiding out in the wilderness. I came off of working with homeless for two and a half years. Menlil adults and see woman's. And hungry people and low income families around here. I'm just really tired and not enough joy in my life. I wanted to be here. So I mean after the first night I was at the Pan-Bash, I really felt a problem in the country. Yeah, this is not the case. And the light and the wind, I mean the factors that are really empty. important and have bearing on your life. Real significant factors things that you have absolutely no control of. You can write by the moon that night. At night, these, we laugh, I don't know what they are. Sort of airplane, I thought. I don't think they got surprised. Looks so 0 Right. Check your face out. That's... Here, photos. Oh, here, people coming down. Come on, hold. Come on. Let's all go. I don't think so. I think you need to have strong faith, but let's do that. And I think I tend to see it more as a political situation rather than a religious situation. It's just a morning. Say, my name is Sors. Angry. Why are you so scared? Well, the thing, okay, the thing, the father, she was that, that you and everyone you're working with is doing. as much as you possibly can. And yet you can't do enough. And someone else has asked you for something else. And you can't do it. And you've learned to have to say no. That's a pretty, just a way to operate. You don't want to operate always feeling your boundaries. if I just keep stretching stretching, you've got a break. So I have to protect myself so I don't break. And then I let all these people down. Do you see? What you see are shadows and blue, the mouth and can't hear a shake to breath while the figure of the tall will walk into bed.

Each week on our program of course which is a theme bring your variety of stories on that theme today's show, Poms of Summer. Imagine that bringing you a big bunch of stories to sell, we're interlacing two stories throughout the hour. One from Scott Carrier, traveling down the green river in Utah. One from our car, some short story called Oxygen from the Miblical Stories in town, even. Before we get back to this story is a good warning to listeners that Ron Carlson's story contains adult situations now. It's explicit language but adult situations. So the last month of that summer, I began seeing Elizabeth Rennstale every day. I told my parents I was at the library because I wanted to sound  a lie, and I haven't known it was a lie. I came in after me and I, the library closed in the night. Elizabeth and I were hardy and focused in lovers, knowing we had two hours we used every minute of it, and we became experts in each other. And never went out for a coke, and never took a break in the last water. He rarely spoke. There was admiration and curiosity in my touch, an affection and gratitude in hers, for so I assumed. And I was pleased, even proud of the time that there was so little need to speak. Meanwhile, Bill Benson began clinging to me worse than ever, and those prolonged visits were full of agony and desperation. I'd never had such a thing happen before. And until it did, I thought of myself as a compassionate person. I watched myself arrive at his terrible house and wheeled the tank toward the door and I searched myself for compassion, the smallest shred of fellow food, kindness, affection, pity. But all I found was your position, patience. Give me the truck keys and a job to do. I had no compassion for guilt-benson. The Sunday before Labor Day, I didn't call in the end-rank. In each minute of the day, Linda N. Wright was in my mind. I saw her there in her green sweater by her father's roll top. We always talked about what we were wearing, and she always said the green sweater. Saying it innocent, as if wearing the sweater that I'd helped pull over her head that night, was a little note of coincidence, and not the most important thing that she'd say. the whole eight dollar come up. And I'd say just leave I as an teacher hoping she'd imagine the belt, the buckle, the trouble you could all beat and dark. I saw her sitting in the afternoon shadow maybe writing some notes in your calendar or reading right over there in the telephone. I could get up and hit the phone booth the last 10 minutes and make that phone ring have her reach for it. But I didn't. I'll let her sit there. and to the last sunlight rocked through the down, broke and disappeared. The last day of my job in the summer of 1967, I thought, and this is the truth. I thought for the first time of what I was going to say last to Elizabeth Brunstell. I tried to imagine it, my imagination. say him. And I climbed from her bed and I'd say gone to her, it was just that, climbing out, dressing and crossing the door. She didn't get up. This wasn't Casin Blanca, we're hiding in Captain Blood. This was getting laid on a hot summer desert town by your father's oxygen delivered mine. There was no way anything else. Some of my customers knew I was leaving and made kind remarks or shook my hand or had their white hand be an envelope with a 20-inch. I smiled and nodded great to me and then turned business- to the dollar and left. These were strange goodbyes because there was no question that would ever see each other again. It had been a summer and I had been there oxygen gun. There was more. I was ya. and they were hell. I stood in the bedroom doors and sunsity and said, take care and I moved to the truck and felt something but I couldn't even today till you were in the woods. The people who didn't know, who said, see you next week, David. I didn't correct them. I said, see you and I've left their homes too. They've all had me in the kitchen. The rain moved in from the day, persistent and even, and the temperature stalled and hovered in about 100. I thought Gil would be pleased to see me so soon in the day, but I surprised him, knocking at the door for five full minutes before he unlocked it and looking to scare. Though I had told him I would eventually be going back to college, I hadn't told him this was my last day. There was no chatter right off the back. I was sitting down at the table. He just moved things out of the way because I wield the oxygen and change tanks. He stood the one side, leaning against the counter. When I finished, he made no move to keep me there. So I just kept going. At the front door I said, there you go, good luck, Gil. His name quickened in and he came after me with short steps and slippers. Well yes, he started his... I wouldn't need this stuff at all if I stayed up in the war. He was off and cranking. When I went outside, he followed me to the rain. You gotta go, I told him it's wet out here. His wet skin and the light of the raw spots on his forehead brown would under his eyes the skin was purple. I'd let him get too close to the truck and he grabbed the door handle. I wasn't sick a day in my life, he said. Asked my wife. I could put my hand. on his on the door handle and I knew I wasn't going to be able to pry it off without breaking it. Kill Benson pulled the truck door open and the surprising deck stared and he stepped up into the vehicle sitting on all my paperwork. I looked at Gill, shrunk in and purple in the darkness and came. He looked  an victim of fire. Gill, I said, I'm late. I looked at him but he did not look. He sat still. He's eyes thin. , it was an expression you used when you wanted someone to hit you. I started the truck hoping that was scary, but he did not move. His eyes were still floating, and that looked  he was grinning. It wasn't a grinning. I kicked my door open and jumped down into the red mallet and went around from the truck. When I opened his door, he did not turn, looking at me. Which was fine with me. I lifted gear  a bride and a clutch. me. His face went against my face. I carried him to the front door. He was light and dulling  an old bird and I was strong, or felt strong, but I can tell this was an insult and old-man did. When I stood in there he would not let go. His hands clasp around my neck and I peeled his hands apart carefully, and I folded him back toward him so he didn't snag me again. By giving us a hug. He was an old wet man. alone desert, he did not mention. It happened in desolation canyon, a wilderness, a place of natural forces, but there was nothing about the river, except a few easily negotiated rabbits. Nothing about the weather, except a strong gust of wind and sunset. And nothing about the night, except the pulses of some distant heat lightning. There was nothing to explain the blue plastic ground cloth rolled around the body of the small 16-year-old boy. This plastic set on the floor of a rubber ground. The raft pulled up on a beach below a dirt road where the airplane planned. The young friend of the boy asleep on the sand. Bleached blonde hair, neckless, smooth tan skin, child. This man and instructive came to fly the body out of the canyon. The more dark in the 16-year-old, the most important, dark yesterday, something worse. He was... discovered by a fellow students at his campsite in about 10-15 p.m. with no apparent pulse we're breathing and cardio pulmonary recestations performed for four months. It's been surprising how the gas thing happened in terms of living in pain on this and quite sure it wasn't the case. Just take me into this rumours and just SpongeBob. should be on the shiit. Tell us about it. And so, in this moment. Once it lightens, it's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster. It's a muster, it's a muster. It's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster, it's a muster, , river has its own space and time, earth dissolves into water, water into air. And death is  a river. You stand next to them, and all the words spell out of your head. I radioed Nadine at the rain and slowed me up and I wouldn't make it back before on. No problem, Sunny Boy, she said, over. I'll hit the rent. stales and on-in over. Sunny boy, she said, just pick up there. Mr. Rensdale died yesterday. Remember the portable unit, okay? You'd  to school. Stop in if you're down for Christmas break. Over. I waited a minute to over and out to Nadine while the news subsided in me. It was on Scottsdale Road at Camelback where I turned right. That corner will always be there. radio call. Copy, over, per se. In front of the Rendsdale's townhouse I felt odd going to the door with the empty dolly. I rang the bell and after a moment, Elizabeth appeared. She was barefoot in jeans and a t-shirt, and she looked at me. I'm sorry about your father, I said. This is tough. She stared at me and I held the gears. I mean it. I'm sorry. She drifted back into the house. I pulled the dolly up the stairs to Mr. Rennstale's room. It had been taken apart a little bit. The bedstrip, our gear all standing in the corner. With Mr. Rennstale gone, you could see what the room was. Just a little box in the desert. I'm going back Friday, Elizabeth had come into the room. I guess I'm going back to school. Good, I said, I didn't know what I'm saying. I started to say something else, but she pointed at me. Don't come. Just do what you do, but don't come in funeral. You don't have to. I want to, I said, or tone it hurt made me mad. I walked to the bed and put my hands on her shoulders. Don't. I bent and looked into her face. Don't. I went to pull her toward me to kiss. She leaned away. sharply, don't David. But I followed her over onto the bed, though she squirmed, tied as a knot. I held her beside me, suggesting her, drawing her back against me. About a minute later, she said, what are you doing? It's okay, I said. Then she put her hand on my wrist stopping it. Don't she said, what are you doing? Elizabeth, I said, kissing at the end. She rose to an elbow and looked at me in her face rock hard, unfamiliar, her eyes were longed. Is this what you came for? She lay back and thumbed off the pants. Is it? Yes, I said. It was the truth and that was pleasure and saying. And go ahead. She moved to the edge of the bed. She didn't move when I pulled away, just laid her and looking up. I remember it as the moment in this life when I was farthest from any of my feelings. I gathered the empty cylinder in a portable gear with a strangest thought. It's going to take me 20 years to figure out who I am now. I could feel a list with Rensdale's hatred. As I would feel it dozens of times a season for me to hear us. It's a kind of dread for me that has become a rutter and kept me out of other troubles. The next year at school I used it to treat Linda N. Wright correctly as a gentleman and keep my distance. I had the chance to win her back and I did not take it. I left for my junior year of college in the Zula three days later. Even before my flight, my parents took me to dinner at a steak house on a nasa, a western place, but they cut your tile if you wear one. My parents were proud of me they said, working hard  this all summer away from my friends. I was changing and saying, and they could tell it was from a better. Much much later, I drove dark streets. The radio played a steady rotation of exactly the same songs heard today, and every 50,000 watt station in this country, every fifth songs the Supremes. I knew where I was going. Beyond the bright rough hedge of the lights of Mesa, I drove until the pavement ended, and then I dropped under the red clay roads and found Gilbancese house. I knocked and called for minutes. I knocked back, I kicked through the debris. leads until I found one of the back bedroom windows unlocked, and I slid it open and climbed inside. In the stale heat, I knew immediately that the house was abandoned. I called Gilles' name and picked my way carefully to the hall. The lights did not work. I wasn't scared, but I was something else. Standing in that dark room where I had ponged old Oreos all summer long, I now had proof. To the room soon that I had lost good dancing. He hadn't made it back and I couldn't wish him back. At home my suitcases were packed. Some big things closing down in me. I'd spent the summer as someone else. Someone I knew I didn't care for and I would be glad when he left town. We would see each other from time to time, but I also knew he was no friend of mine. I eased along the empty roadways trying simply to gather what was left to think. But it was  trying to fold a big blanket alone. I kept having to start over. The sun is going down and three fans are camped beside a trout stream in southern Utah. The women are talking to each other by the picnic table. The men are watching the children playing water. Two of the women in the sister. One has just had enough air with a man Los Angeles. On the phone she swore to her sister that she retell her husband and in the voice. But now she is thinking she will not say anything ever. about the affair and maybe wait a while in divorce. For Sister is swaying back and forth with a baby in an arms. This morning, the baby suffered right hand and a couple of hot coffee and crying for how it is. Now she's asleep, but her fingers had big balloon- blisters that will break and heal slowly, leaving long, bright scarves. The third woman is two days pregnant and thinking about taking an hour. Of the man, one. is trying to decide when it would be the best time to drive into town and call his broker. One is thinking about running up the mountain to smoke a joy and watch the sun go down. The other is looking at the water, one is fish might  a grasshopper. The children are playing and fighting over a toy sailboat. The three-year-old boy is soaking wet and nearly out of his mind with possibilities. The five-year-old girl is standing on the bay, making up wolves and shouting out orders. Sheam! and dropping lettuce and cheese from her sandwich. There are little birds in the trees and big birds on the rock walls of the canyon. Red rock walls in the shadow of the afternoon sun. A dirt road comes around and down and crosses over the street and in the pool below the road the pale snakes slide silently into the water and swims to the other side holding something rather large in its mouth. There are three cars all white and there is an Indian or rather the goat. The most evidently lived and died in this spot, sitting cross-legged on the hood of the station wagon. This is the beginning of the story. The story is about how the husband realizes his wife has been unfatial, and it's about how the Indian died and what the snake had in its mouth, and how the two-day old life inside the mother grows in his born, and becomes a beautiful young woman who paints the palms of Rilpa on the desert black top highway. The sun is going down, and three battles are camp. decided to try out stream in southern Utah. This is the beginning of the story, but there isn't enough time to tell it. Scott Carrier and Ron Carlson perform, funding for this American Life's part about the corporation for public broadcasting, the John D. and Catherine Tim Clark Foundation and the listeners of WB Beezish, although I'm Eric Gawas, back next week with more stories of the American Life."
