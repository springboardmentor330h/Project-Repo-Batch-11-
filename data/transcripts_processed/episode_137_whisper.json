  "text": "when she was seven, when she was a visitor grandma, a lot of what we'll do the books that a grandfather had done that means alive. What she liked especially was finding the books where he'd made little notes and the margins. So that was the part that was really in the accountant. Because they were hence badly well. Exactly. And they were a lot of times they were really critical. They would just do the right. I stood fast and disagree. Something  that. Wow. And where he would he would write. Ah, if you really liked it. As a kid, over the course of the bad of year, she systematically divided the books into two piles, the ones with markers, and the ones path. And then she tried to read all the ones with markings. Her grandfather was a playwright and a teacher, and the books were creaky old books from the 1930s about theater, and about how to write plays. Who's strong? And when she was alive and she wrote her very first play, using the rules in the books, and also another generation. So we're our kid girls. start your play with lots of exposition. She's really in Vogue at the time. So I started mine with a Butler. His name I believe was Manson picking up a phone saying stuff , No, the lady in general, and not home right now. Why it offensive charity ball? Yes, he's still drink much. She's a very dark, cool, she's  cool. I'm not kidding. you were all laughing. By the time I got into the college, and I started to take running class. It was brought to my attention that, , stayed straight, and it shouldn't be the thing. , there are followers who might tell us a plan, and one of the two, my teacher, who was not a young man, when you said, it was , , don't use sort of OCHA anymore. to be the USB screw.\" I'm just right whispered. But if all the books on her grandfather's shelves there was one book that affected her more than the others. It had lots of grandfather's writing in margins. It was very critical so there was this very rare that he would write a ex-combatian book. There were more odds in mass harts out of my underpins. I'll just call it act one. Then I think almost anything other than that. Mass Heart was a broad-rate playwright, the man who directed my girlfriend, Lady, Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison, who is married to another than women, her name Kitty Carlyle, who people these days mostly remember his game show, just back in 1960s. The book details how he started as a kid in the Bronx found something he would just love to do. He'd used to make players. Reading it as a child, a left-hand head that experienced, that you'd have sometimes a kid. He did not understand everything in the book. A change stood an up-to-note. that she really liked. , knew what was going on in this book to find. It drove him so powerful and it seemed  so happy. She read Act 1 by Mosshart over and over. She memorized hot stretches, tried to memorize the entire book. Even today, she recalls were specific paws for pencil-dent grandfathers' copy. Because it felt  I was written at all times. It felt  a familiar idea. So I fell at home, this guy liked the same home. I want. And then so this might be... Yeah. Yeah. You don't mean many people who tell you that what changed your lives. It's a appealing notion, I think, because it's nice to think that our lives could be changed, just by an idea. By the vision of the world that happens in a book, instead of whatever lives are often changed by, , you got more tragedies for instances. Today in our radio pub... stories of people whose lives were changed by books. The U.B. E. Chicago, Public Radio International, it's a American life, Margargos. I program today in four acts, act one is calm, act one. It includes about how to live your life from notes scribbled by your dead grandfather and margins of book, back to family that reads together. In this act, the story of how when David Sedaris was a boy, he stumbled upon a dirty book in the woods, made his sisters be. all adults with new pounds of suspicion. It's in him to the dictionary. A three Roger and me Lewis and Clark. Straight in construction worker and this question. Can you let me change by both that you have never seen and have not read. And for little thought houses for you and me. It is the old old story my friend. New York girl leaves big city. It's at the small town on the prairie. The dream and the vomit. Stay with us. Act 1. So, let's say young says that she never meant lost parts out of biography to be a blueprint for her life. But looking back, the events in the past two decades, that seems to have been the case. Basically, what I did was,  he did in his life story, I moved to Newark. I think I can follow him here. Really, you can't just stop. I don't think it was conscious but there are so many things that I did that he did. I wasn't as good of you as much. You need to fake it that I'm not human type. But  I teach. He went to get money at a certain point. He's , I need money. So he's the rich person I know. And he wrote a letter to this woman and showed up in the door of the house. I'm left hard and I have a plane. You give me money. Go call it on. She did. And I went, I was an amazing and I wrote letters to strangers and said, I'm a lexat, I have a play and if you fund my play you can be part of the theater. And did that work? I did one time, yeah. At some point, did you study Russian? Yeah. , it, it, it, it, it, it, it. that we turned from kind of a mentor, a make-believe mentor to a pretend have them to be kind of the trick. Yeah, somehow I think I decided that time had completely screwed up and sent Moss to keep her on it. And that if you hadn't just had died to your flight born, then me and Moss would really have had chance. all this stuff, man, this is a fun day with life. You be out on dates and just not lost. Yeah, not going. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it would be , if you're something missing, , just wasn't quite what you'd want. And , watching , find some guy and we're working this play together and we'll be , how the town try out and Philadelphia and we'll be up for 48 hours trying to fix our play and then we'll crack it and it will be on your lunchroom. room certainly. So how long is the whole thing go? Well I think right before the end of college Kitty Paralyze spoke one and Edgar Collins. That's right she's very active in here arts and she's screaming a huge advocate for arts and coming. And so she was talking about that. I stood in line after she spoke, she made her, and they were all these people around. And they were very, very good on their game show. And I was just , disgusting. Oh, please, she's in the night of opera. She's  singer. She's not just a singer. Lady. And but by the time I got to the front of the long, I went up to talk to her. I said it well. I wanted to say sort of it was, , more has changed my life and I moved to New York to be a playwright  . I think I said something long along the way, your husband is so much to me. , she's  it. And she's so, she's so elegant, so classy. She's , I don't understand that I'm getting no end. She was just terrible. I'm very she'll tear. Yeah, because there was I think I she probably heard some kind of own your shiver possessiveness in the way as your argument so much. As if I knew so I think it was confusing since she probably figured out the opportunity. But it was disturbing. It didn't feel  so. just far or far. It's taken moment. And , it was a scary despair because, , she's a person that he loved. But my friends that was with me was really nice. Lots of them. I don't worry about her. Her too much better from us than she was. You need the whole story too. And, Bob. was just spending time with her because she happened to be alive. you talked about how you felt dated, framed somewhere, drawn to somewhere. Have you thought about what is the line that rides that kind of need? How thick going that? From a scary stop. He filmed. Yeah, sure, because the truth is really the way he functioned in my life was as a comfort. And I knew, I wasn't really broke, I wasn't breaking theality, but it was the sounds that, , when you read a book and something speaks to you and feel , feel understood. And so it makes the world a less long story. I think that I think that because I didn't know my grandpa, I could talk about what's it was not. And shall we this part take in? and 44 pages of what it would be  to want to get a try to get that happen. And so it was  he was sort of standing grandpa in a lot of ways. And the other part about it is well. The way people talk about him, and then the first one read every single book. Him about that end is such a rough appreciation and perfection. It's just staggered. I think that that was how people spoke about my phone. And I recognized that same business, sort of, the way that I played up. Let's start with the new younger doll! Let's begin. Today before I introduce you to the past and interrupts here. It's a day off. The weather that you bring us to the United States of New York. Obviously, this is a great one. And it does have this one. It's  this one is beautiful. We're in there. Hmm. He's fantastic. Most. this thing. This is to a student, right room, dear friends, this is asked down on the names of students. One of the co-workers, fellowvers, three of this to you. It's intended to tell you as much as I know about my present situation. There by, of course, but  what the prospects of the future work and gather. The planning decided to remind me of the core of this way and that I've very important in the process. I'm afraid I can set out any of my own signals. Needy trouble. It's very personal math. Ask me. share with the close and the family, they've never been on anyone else. The same time I just test mysteries and those people who've called have I helped in concrete and suppose we knew it. The truth is, the shifting, sometimes very simply. What you may have heard a few weeks back is now in true. And then his, his favorite besides there's some viewer relatively recent friends, some of our compactized real years back. Old friends are new, the depth of my feeling of view of a life just in paint at the end. I'm going to put in the next several paragraphs in parentheses and asking that I'm not reading them all out. Each of you who wishes to read a quote so anyone who dislikes this is my clinical details employed and then paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs and then he talks about the correctness to just not very good and through these statistics would be 24 minutes. Doubtless, all of that sound very clean. We did knit, I can think of having that. But one thing, I don't at all approve of my speech. I don't  the idea of it one bit. The reason is, shows me what the world can get along very nicely without me. I can't quite leave that will. Still, there are a few small conversations. The one thing I had always hoped that I could face when you got to sleep. Spiel hat searched for things  that in the theater. And it says, and that's really what I'm finally wanting to say. Thank you, great, but, and in case there isn't a chance to see it, and thanks for your concern, your calls, your notes, but above all for your love. You've had my love, and I've had your damn fortune, so thanks, and good luck. Love for us. And so this is the first time I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you. Yeah, yeah. guys, you said, , I'm a damn fortunate man. You're a swell kid. Yeah. I'm a good man. I'm a good man. I'm a good man. I'm a good man. After a few years in New York City, I got to see Unmove to Los Angeles. As you can probably do, it's great. screenplay so Hollywood, most recent issue was one of the executive producers of the TV show friends. Back to the family that reads together. Sometimes it will change your life, but just in a small temporary way and not for the better, we have this cautionary tale of how a book infected in the entire family, in right-of-day vidsideras, but going into listeners before we begin some of the content of the story might not be suitable for every listener, so there is no graphic language name. words and graphics scenes, nothing in fact even had to be. I found the book hidden in the words being the sheet of plan. It's covered torn away, page 10, no. I read, rock and body rivers stood in the dry, waving goodbye to the raffer in hastal day. Goodbye, they said, wait me? Goodbye, the raffer in respondent. Tell those two teams of yours, Josh and Sandy, that they'll make an excellent addition of our young persons ministry. They're fine kids, he said, with a wing. Almost as fine and foxy as their parents. The river is chuckle, raising their hands in another way. When the reverence car finally left the drive when, they stood for a moment when the bright sun shone before descending into the basement dungeon on the shaft of the tree. They say it's as眼 still stings and doors of a thousand. We've got to listen to loose wacky best Muslims as Noxie. I'll be expected in their upper middle class community. The river's family practiced a little interpretation of the phrase, Love The Neighbor. L'Inbore's gem lists, these people were both shameless and insatiable. Father and daughter, brother and sister, mother and son. After exhausting every possible combination, they widened their circle to include poor EC captives and door to door knife sales. Yes, these people were not in. But at the age of 13, I couldn't help but admire their infectious energy and spirit and join him. The first few times I read the book, I came away shocked, not by the characters behind him, but by the innumerable typhons. Nobody bothered to prusely this book before sending it to the friend. In the opening chapter, the daughter was caught fumbling her brother's cat. in the dining room. On page 33 the son has sex with his mother, who, re-opold, possesses a fawn power of thoughts. I showed the book to my sister Lisa, who taught from our hands saying, let me hold on to this for a while. She and I often swap babysitting jobs and considered ourselves fairly well-wet and feel literary pornography. Look in the parents bedroom, be to sweaters in the second drawer of the white dress, she's said. He reached red the story of how uncollected writings of the mark of the side, with one eye on the front door, fearful with the homo-nuts might walk in and torture us with barbed whips and hot oils. We know you, our looks would send as if you had to check on us and be chocked. We know all about you. Fuck. The booklets and Lisa too are 11-year-old sister Gretchen, who interpreted it as a startling non-fiction expose and have the near-kind little eyes. In pretty sure the exact same thing is going on right here in one field, so I start talking the book beneath the artificial grass and for Eastermask. Take the Sherman family for example. Just last week I saw Heidi's taking her hands down stage in his pants. I asked you broken arms, I said, you probably just talking in a shirt. Which... She was going to vast the talking brochure, she asked. She had a queen. The careful studies suggested the shermers were not the people they could take. The father was often seen tugging the scratch, and the white pattern disturbing her but of looking used great in the eye, whilst meeting her fingers. A veil had been met, especially for Gretchen who now saw the world as a steaming pin on bite such a wound. She did an alone share at the country. She would narrow her eyes speculating on the children crowding the shower room before. I have a sneaky suspicion, whose daily young blood might be our half-sister. She's got her father's chin, but the unison now got pure and moan. I felt uneasy in forcating our hands, but Gretchen provided a well for Gretchen neville's. She noted the way our mother applied lipstick to the approach of the pedochipum reference, and she addressed what. first name and often invited in to use the bathroom. Our father referred to the bank towers as DAW, Smeetok, and their responses suggested that he had taken advantage of them one time too many. The Greek Orthodox Church, the Gale address couples at the country's house, even our elderly colleagues Duchess. They were all renaught, didn't fetch. He took the and our foster oss doesn't love clinical community! The book wound up in the hands of our ten-year-old sister, Amy, who used it as a textbook and make believe class she held after school each day. Dress in the wig and her heels, she passed her late afternoon standing before a blackboard and imitate teachers. I'm very sorry, Ken, but I'm going to have to fail. Dress in one of the empty fault in chairs and arranged before. The problem is not that you don't try. The problem is that you're stupid, very very stupid. Isn't candid stupid class? She's ugly too am I wrong? Very well. You can sit back. And for God's sake, please stop. Okay class, now I'm going to read you from this week's new book. Just story about a California family and it's called Next, Can't. If they need read the book, be sure, you can see him back. We are all keeping and sharing the books. We possibly buy our brother Paul, who would be aged two, might have sucked on the common issues even more dangerous and waiting. So early this had to stop before a gallant pain. Even our ancient in landmarks was a rising practice paper, suspicious looking surface in the fox. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. We've just been here. who eventually remembered over to our mother. I'll make sure this is properly disposed of from Mother's Day, pouring down the hall when it's in the bed. Pan-attranged and she laughed reading out loud and ran into the sea and she called the sun. The sea is a sea of water, and the sea is a sea of water. The exclarator, Gretchen and I found the book hidden between the metals and box springs of my parents' bed. The pages stained with coffee rings and cigarettes. To discover a scene-developed in all of breaching suspicions, I'll be coming for a sending day now, she won't. Be prepared, my friend, because this time I'll be playing for cubes. Be waited. I'd always made it a point just my mother before going to bed, but not anymore. The feel of her hand on my soul, though now made my fish calm. She was sending up. pair of my pants when I was a girl. When standing before her on a kitchen chair, I felt her hands, graced my butt. I just want to be friends, I stand. Nothing more, nothing less. She took the pins out of a mouth and sputtyed me for a moment before a song. Dang! And here you've been leading me in, obviously. I read the book once more, hoping to recapture my earlier pleasure, but it was too late. T « Hi.chodzi» It couldn't read the phrase he punched his godders rock hard novels without thinking of aggression, barricade and who saw from the bedroom. I thought I might throw the book away or maybe even burn, but  a perfectly good outgrown sweater, it seemed to change the destroyer in the world with full of people who might get some news on me. With this in mind I carried the book to the grocery store parking lot, and tossed it in the bath and showing me the pickup truck. So then took up my post beside the stores out. of ending missions, waiting until the truck's owner turned pushing the cart to the grocery. He was a wiring and a fashionable mutton chop sidebarps and a half cast on his owner. As he placed his bags into the back of the truck, he was designed to be on the floor. I've watched as he picked it up and moved through the first few pages, before raising his head to search the parking lot. On the tip of cigarette instead, he quit his work and has adherved against the wheels of the truck and hornsiding in front of the team. Then he slept the book into his pocket, and drove away. Music Data to the Earth is the author of several books including naked, and meets the story of peers. Coming up, we found to your then and then, let's in a minute, an obligating or international and an program continues. This American life in my class is each weekend a program of course we use a theme bringing variety of different kinds of stories and things, days of program, the book that changed my life. We've arrived at X3 of our show, X3, Roger and me, Lewis and Clark. There's book as literature, there's book as filth and then there's book as pure physical objects. This is the story of somebody from whom a book changed its life though it is almost revend up and it happened at all that he got to know this book in the first place. Jeremy Goldstein, this is the story. But who's heard that one? one evening, scratching, looking for things to do in the spare time. One day he noticed this plate he'd be given by his grandmother, played from a 1905 fair celebrating the Centennial Lewis and Clarkson Edition, explore the western frontier. He looked at the plate and wondered if there was anything else left there still around. He turned out there was a lot, started buying it up. It was fun hobby collecting the various members of the family of the family and fair. But when you reach point, we're had about 1100 items. one of the larger collections known. It was the end of the trade grant and I couldn't find if thing did to you. And somebody mentioned why don't you collect books about Lewis and Clark? I thought, well that might be kind of a slimy thing. So in 1984, when you were a little collection of one day to come as a quarter of Game Arts. It's a ridiculous piece. Was zajers nails? Well not clear, but then belief that one is lost. No less it's lost than the other now, then something repeating my poetry. $9.5. I had the difficult time right now at that check because at that time in fact I really didn't know much about my proceeded to take that set of books down town Portland to establish book either saying it's a precious man. I showed him the set. I said well that's that said isn't that's all the journals and he kind of charcoal these set on this there's a lot more publications and that about the journals. Clark. So I'm going to have to say, well I tell you what, you give me about five years. I don't have every book published about this. And he laughs so hard about laughing so hard. It's chair. He was a heavy set gentleman. He was late 60s at the time. And he said there's there's people in this and lifetimes. Looking for every book was Clark. Never succeed it  told him Maybe I won't have every book, but I'll have the best library of anybody in the States and he laughed harder Strange as it may sound this is all the took to send Rod run his path for massing just 14 years What did become largest? ala all this time you can gain in struct the rating lands, laying pipes and pursers in growth. I decent living, but it was never enough. Anything after house payment, basic expenses for living, would go toward buying books. I would have to work 10, 12 hours. It's normally six days a week. Some summers I would take a day off just so that I could work a little better check. So maybe I could get that next book or make that other credit card need. because I was now beyond my needs. At one point, I had 12 credit cards. And then, of course, I had a house  a reslanance, which I did three times. I don't know how to explain it exactly, but if there was a book out there that I didn't have, I would find the names to be quite. When you get something, 18th month. century. You open up the book and you look at the color, the discoloration, pages, and the smell. And that's when you really feel what true energy of history. Not what you read, but you've got more sense of just your eyes. It's smelly, feely touchy. This actually points to one of the strangest things about Rogers relations with his collection. You all about the different Lewis and Clark books, Marvel's ending, Stuart and some tit flakes in the value of original boards. But Roger never became an expert on what was inside the books. He didn't collect books to read them. He just wanted to own it. Slip the End of Textures more talks on insan leave. Such a It turns out that your life can be changed by books you didn't even read. In fact, Roger never been reading books. It needs books as a kid, he's good at college, and his reading habits didn't change as an adult. His house was full of books. As a collector, Roger was undeterred and he was Catholic, but after ten years, one book still alluded. It's the cornerstone of any serious loos in Clark Collection. But first, they should have the first decision now to be. condition. The two volume set published in 1814, fewer than 1500 copies were ever printed. But the price tag often around $10,000 had always scared Rajrawah that in 1994, $49 looked  Los Angeles in the LA book. That particular day, you got there early. And then there was somewhat of a race when they opened up the gate. They would actually have been standing. So they are on the other side. It's  kids. running for the opening of carnival. I saw her just casually, I didn't run to William Prysis. And introduced myself, oh yeah, right Roger. And, I just did bring me something, I'm going to listen to all of this. He turned and looked toward the last kiss. And there sets two volumes of 18s they're in. First clark dreams. And this. set was beautiful and I was just oh shakin' yeah I wanted this set so bad I looked at him and I just what what what what what what what's the price bill said well 12,500 I was crushed I knew it was beyond me OK So as I kind of back to way and start to walk away from the booth, just knowing, shaking my head to myself, I can't afford it. There's no way I can get that I'm kind of happy to sit and look. Somehow I've got it. I can't stand these moments. You can't. There's no way I'm kind of happy to sit and look. It's how they all can I do it. She's a very good one. I want to the bar, guys, you're a scotch. I walk back to the boots with light. Scotch in hand. And I, I, I, I, I, try to look at those again. I'll, sure, mop the shelves on the couch. These will ride you. What, what can you afford? I says, I don't. I says, we're not working. This is a slow time dear. I might be able to do a thousand months. But, I don't feel , . We're not working now. I don't know. Maybe maybe in May or June,  when we start working overtime. And he said, well, you want to embrace me? Yeah, but gosh, I can't end before I could send you to the conversation. Mr. East turned around. She could put him in the bag, wrapped him up, turned around. Good else, yeah, let's shook my hand and said, that sounds good enough. us to me. The 1814 became Rogers calling part. Established him as an expert in all things written about to his part. And then something happened. Rogers started to meet his books. Before this he occasionally pulled out a book, read a random passage. But now he started to plow through whole books, front to back. Now it's my turn. to study the things. Let's look at this book, this in front. I've got it open to just by chance a passage that brings a lot of pleasure to me, which is passage comes about halfway through the expedition, after 18 months of looking for a loop to the ocean, finally we meet the second. Finally, we are in view of the ocean, this great Pacific Ocean, which we have so long, anxious to see. roaring in the noise made by the waves, breaking on the rocky shores, maybe hurt distinctly, ocean in view, oh the joy. So in this passage, place yourself on the banks of the Columbia river looking out toward the ocean. , I mean, right, , I'd be jumping up and down, screaming, where is that, where is that, where is that, yellow of this water? Which they didn't have at that time. Unfortunately, I mean, they were taking a gau- All chugged it made it just been sloshed on the bank to just party and forever it is it's great What what a feeling of of success? It just brings a great pleasure myself Ocean and you all the ruin Last week Roger made a program at sorts to see for the first time, the original handwritten journal, Lewis and Clark kept during their expedition. Here are the books that everything, Water Ever bought, are descended. Most of the journals are stored at the American Phil's Soccer Society, Philadelphia. They are in remarkable condition. The librarian turned the books and piss pages for Rodger working as detailed maps, which should be drawn to the vanems. Water barely moved their spoke. Oh! Close Ukraine. I want to point right to the rest, be touched, who is told now. And after less than an hour with the journals, who wandered back into the library, is meaning. The book is altered by life from the Emmanuel Labor to the being of the scholar of knowledge. From the interior of the book. I'm just leaving back on the professor, the Lewis Park one said that, well, Roger, you can't put yourself down to be in a big construction floor. And he said, that's the school of another type. He says, , I love school and I love education. And he says, now that you're entering that field with us, he says, he's, I have great respect for what you've done and what . And thanks for the great. In the years in Fratern began collecting value of all things loose in Clark his sword, Stephen Ambrose wrote a popular book on George, and Burns did a documentary. These fueled fire. And last fall, Roger arranged for loose in Clark College, Clark's purchasing entire collection, called a Mouse To a Small Fortune. He promptly retired construction, the age of 54. A year's smiles. A year's smile. I walked in, sat down, leaned back in the chair. And thought, wow, a whole new life. I don't have a alarm clock now. I mean, I've got one, but it's not in use. When my body says to get up in the morning, I get up. I stretch, do some light exercises. Have a nice relaxing breakfast. Any of those in construction industry now, I'm listening to this. Beaker hard selling. Most of Rogers' days are now spent in the library of Louis and Clark College, with our parents and she's Clark and she's Clark. Rogers for years. , Roger would off-time get off a work when he was still working in the construction and not even clean up and come over to lose the Clark and spend time with me. He was a chat and talked about books. He was tired. He was very tired. He looked , he just gone through a hard day of labor. on a construction site. Now you see Roger, he strolls in sometime in the morning when every feels  it. He walks in feeling  a king and then I usually go up to the herded drone and I just sit there and immerse myself in with that. Of course I'm surrounded by the books. It's a wonderful feeling and he goes up there and he works and every couple of every hour or two, he'll come down all the time and take you got to come here and see this and I'll come upstairs. and he'll show me something and we'll get excited about it and I see him in the heritage room for many years to come writing books and having people coming and talking and just join the rest of the life. That's story by Jeremy Goldstein, the television producer in the United States. That's a good one. Back for Little Sad House is for you and... me. When you really love a book, what exactly you're supposed to do with that feeling after you finished reading book? And then perhaps finished reading about book. If you just feel strongly enough about it, I think there is this impulse to somehow get closer to book, to somehow try and congeor the world of the book right here in real worlds. So if you read about a Broadway playwright maybe move to New York City, start writing plays. Or if you're already live in New York City, but it will take place somewhere else you head out there. Megan Down is this story. I'm moving to Nebraska. No one understands why. I've lived in New York City for seven years, which is essentially all of my adult life. And a few months ago I started making plans ahead out west. Not all the way west to California or Oregon, which people from around here might understand, but to the great plains. I wanted to move someplace flat, treeless. Some place that gives up sense of how big this country used to be before automobiles. in the jet age before you could be cavalier about traveling from one place to another. There are a lot of reasons behind my move, but one of the reasons has to do with a book. With nine books as a matter of fact, there are the books written by Laura Engels Wilder, but her child that is a pioneer girl on the vast Midwestern prairie, Malade 1800s. When I was a little girl, growing up nearly 100 years later from the 1970s, I wanted to be  Laura so much that I made my- mother so me it's son-barnet, which I wore constantly. Laura, I wore my hair and braids. Before I knew how to write, I drew picture books featuring the entire English family. It was always a variation on the same theme. The family moves to a new home and counters hardships. And through a particular combination of self-reliance and hard work, makes a life for themselves in the new place. A place so remote, so unsettled, so cold, that no civilization is Sexualization. not even most Indians that ever dared to live there. To me, this kind of uncharted life was the best kind to have. And it was even better that it required a sunmonet. So, it's hard at three stoves, but the first one is the bruise to stoome. That's where I'm handled. I'll put it down and take it around. This is my blood mild to South West. I'm in the Smith South Dakota, writing a horse. strong wagon around the actual land that the Ingles lived on. Our tour guide is Tim Sullivan, Tim and his wife, Joan, on the 154 acres of land that Laura's father, Charles Ingles, claimed in 1880s, part of the Homestead Act. This is an old, frapper storm, and the rustic stuff, the end of the Homestead. A lot of people think the Ingles come from walnut, broken, soda, because that's what the television series was said. But in fact, they only lived there for me. years. Laura came to the smet in 1870, and she was 12. She was where she grew up, between school teacher, and met and married on month or while. Six of her books are set there. For those who remember, it's the place where Laura at her sister, Mary, who was blind, got lost in the tall wet grass that's known as the big slew. It's the place where the family survived a long winter, when it was a place she always considered on. Well sinceря, she'll have a water samen in the ocean before she runs away, and she calls the US. The world is a very cool ground, the walkover is a very school, because the two of them are going home, it's last there, it's  a school. There's a certain kind of town that is defined solely by one industry, steel towns where at least one member of every family works in the mill. This meant a sort of  that too, except the industry is the series of books. Every year, past 29 years, the towns people have put on a page in based on more as life. Just about everyone in this town of 12th-Honk has participated in the project. Or at least had one family member who was put on 1880 style clothing at one time or another, and given tours at the museum, or given some hapless tourist directions to the cemetery. For caravans of family cars, wind around the ground, the burial sites, the charles, carolai, Mary, Terry, and Grace Engels. Almost every establishment in this net, even the local bar, has rescued us, labeled Ma. pop. But even though this meant is for all intents and purposes, the tourist town, it doesn't feel one. Instead, it feels  a town with a hobby. A place where a lot of people devote a lot of time to want to do their idea. The tourists, though they're greeted in that typically warm, with western way. Feel almost incidental to the larger cog celebrating Laura. I talked to a man who had acted in the page for 27 years, missing only two performances the whole time, one of them because of a compine accident in which he lost his finger, and his son was in jail almost died. He was back on stage the next night. His wife, Albena, had driven them to the hospital and witnessed a pretty gory series of medical procedures formed by the way without anesthesia. The night of the accident, her husband had one request for her. I was playing math the time and so I did perform that night and I think I was probably in shock myself because it went very well but it was on Sunday night. It was where I kind of felt quite nice. I forgot a few lights but it moved me to bed. Laura's books have a lot to do with the notion of rising to the occasion and the hydrogen demands countless hours volunteer effort. Who operate? and manual labor done out from plaint. In a way, this kind of idyllic romantic work ethic is not what I expected when I came to dissiming. Or, I should say, it is what I expected. And that's what took me by surprise. Traditionally in a story  this, the writer goes to the place she's dreamt of and finds that it's not  what she imagined at all. But the remarkable thing about dissimed is that it really is the little town of a prairie. The people are a bit  the people in large pots. They're proud of the land they live on. And in a strange way, it is if Laura's power's description have affected the way they talk about the place. And it's beautiful out here in the hurry this evening we're going to be at the big sea. Her to cattle over there. I think it looks just  it did in Laura's. Now, we're building Zunny on the other side. But the big sea is, I  the way the black bird swing in the reeds, the way the cat tails loo, the puddles. one. Sometimes that's in these communities. Mary and Pramers, the author of the Laura Englefildre Pagent, were sitting at a picnic table on the Engle's Homestead, a busy day of tourism, is winding down. Visitors are getting back in their minivan. Tim Sullivan's eight-year-old son Brian is a siblings costume, and hasn't dressed with her soul. Mary in a 65. So how much different was your life from Laura's. but well I guess my child was before electricity before anyone and I lived on a working farm in which forest there was response there that's a lot of the same that's why I  the Laura books around it because Laura had to do the same things I had to do we had little pots and sheep and the milk wheat to be for it it was a wonderful time family was very important life seems simple you are Zen because we didn't do so many things and go so much but I'm not sure there are ghosts. You remember when you first got electricity and water and what was that ? For his development we had electricity in 40 years and it had been working for a long time including lines and finally lines were all in. and they were all hooked up. They were just waiting for the major flow of energy. The electricity was on and it was first night. And that night, it was a guy that I remember my father and my mother, my mother, sister, and one of my brothers, was to there. Look, because suddenly it was not what country ended up. You can see our neighbors  this. Made it seem a lot less lonely, a lot less icy. Mary and was in music teacher for many years, who are becoming a pioneer school teacher on the Eagles home set. Every day she hangs out in a one-room school house, which looks exactly the way Lord describes her classroom, Bruce D. Schoole, in her book, Please Happy Golden Years. Mary and Gives Greek Music Math lessons to the tourists, and then has the class suite of the book, Murrah Blackboard. Who goes up? something  it's best to be truthful, honest, make the best of what we have. Somehow it sounds revolutionary. Prairie is the only place I've been to in my life, where you paint some blessed sweetest, even if I dare say most of the shade, state, felt for the virtues of life. And it sounds  anything that you say. It is if the wind, which barrels through here  a wild animal, just knocks the iron. any out of everything. After a long day working at the Ingles' home set, Joan Sullivan Tim's wife walks me down to the edge of the big slew. The grass is taller than we are, and it's easy to see how Mary and Laura have gotten lost here. , there's still some honesty. , that's the word, that's the word, that's good to choose one honest. , do what's right. And that's, that's, I guess what, helping being here is an IZZ. It's a lot of hard work. We wonder, , we'll just try stamping. work out to be able to keep running. But there's something about taking those morals and passing that on to a family. Do you think that has to do with farming or to think of something about the time that Laura was living in or a foundation of those? Probably a combination of those. Trying to make it on a dollar. Trying to, , on a work's hard. , they feed the world. Why? Hello. I'm glad so many of you have come to our little town on the ferry in this year. This is especially fine country. This ferry. At this time of the year, this is the hour that daylight softens and quite light fall. Oh, please forgive me. Sometimes I get a little carried out. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Paget runs three weekend each summer. Admissions $5.700 people come each night. It's held right in the middle of the prairie, on land adjacent to the Ingalls home stead. From the Paget site you can see the five cottonwood trees that pop lantern. One for each of my girls said, meaning ma and score daughters. The dialogue in the Paget has been free recorded. When the Paget is actually performed, the cast members lips. the words and it's mind the action. This technique has its benefits and its perils. During the first performance this year, the after-playing prom is to stew and his words keep booming down on stage even though he wasn't there. The actors playing Mary and Laura and Ma carried on talking to an invisible paw  who's the voice of God. Ha, is it on Indian land or land will have to move from? Maura Indian land  pretty girl? This is so bad land. Just wait first for a moment. I want to play that open where I can run with the wind. Lots of room, . It'll be the Ingo home set. Doesn't that sound fine? I am completely charmed by this patch. Yes, there are some states. Yes, you can hear places on the soundtrack with the tape and an edit end. But all I can think is I watch the people on stage. of farmers, retired farmers, and the wise and kids of farmers. So how effectively they capture the feeling of the book. They're not selling anything. There's no agenda other than to celebrate Laura. In fact, she cared enough about this town, right? These books about it. It's dusk on the fairie. Literally. That doesn't sound  something you'd say in earnest. It sounds  the lyrics and some cowboy folk song, or a chickenly bad one. in a romance novel. But it's not. It is simply dust on the prairie. Little girls and sweaters and pants from the gap are wearing sunbond since standing on the benches to get a better look. Pathers with Pussy babies stroll around the field so their wives can watch the tension understood. An eight-year-old girl and seagurs and jeans run through the grass, the wind whipping over here, or sunbond flying out behind her. The pageant to the huge hit. When the show's over, the audience storms the stage to get the autographs and cast members. People are saying it's the best thing they've ever seen. That this trip to the smet is the best vacation they've ever had. It's remarkable, really, that in a time when families can take vacations to Disney World, or visit great adventure, or even just stay home and watch TV. We'll travel all the way south to Codan. You see a world that's just... in a series of books. The Ingles family managed to make homes for themselves and some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable, and a cabin in the deep woods, in the banks of the creek, in a shanties surrounded by hundreds of flat empty acres. But no matter where they live, top-lighted spittle, nodded her sewing, and Laura managed to find the light in the world around her. Maybe that ability to merge the indoors and the outdoors, to familiar in the unfamiliar. So what are these people are responding to? Maybe that's why there's so much romance and whole notions that haven't stepped out in the middle of nowhere. People want to find comfort in an inherently uncomfortable place. They want to see if they can make it through the long winter and still see the beauty in the snow. Megan Downley's New York City in 2. weeks to move to Nebraska.
