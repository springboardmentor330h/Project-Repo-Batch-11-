  "text": "the ability is a Chicago Publicating International, it's a American light, a private glass, and I hold my hands, children's book, called Nobody's Family's Going to Change. I was in the 1970s by the same writer for the Harriet the Spy, who he's fits here. It is have to say an hardly menacing title. Nobody's family's going to change. Very stupid, it was for a show, which after it's part of the series, it's with the little princess who got set and never woke up. Daddy drinks as high. got made pretty gross pretty busy with the more and sharing its resistives. In fact, it's a serious and really good, rather brave book that the Svang is approaching. Who is a fan one? It's not a spec. Share it. They mean disapproving dad, a mom who tries to smith these over, some who wants to dance and show that it's totally cant  this one. A daughter Emma who's used to date for me too much. Which is a fan? to be different. Over the course of the book, Emma tries to get her dad to change, to listen to them, to be kind. She joined something called the Children's Army, which agitates the notion that it's a child's right to change as her family. And then finally, for example, to the book, sitting at dinner, as her father and brother rehashed the same fight that they always have, Emma realizes that her parents will never change. It had will always be harsh. We'll never treat her or her brother when we care about them. And that you can't change, you shouldn't try. And the best you can do is change yourself. So, she goes and tells her friends. You have trouble understanding it. You've seen. What about my father, Ash Golden? Your father said, son, it's the last cause. He thinks boys are great. He's never going to think you're anything. He's your girl. What's his golden that can't change that? No. But you can stop wanting him to change. Six hundred. and we felt  the topic we're head with my office. So I'm just got it, I hope they... That's what I need, said Emma, but that's just what I'm talking about. We have to step waiting around and then to love us. That's the 70s, one of the kids suggested they call me consciousness racing group. The fact is, even those of us who are adults, no better, to accept their parents and siblings, we hope they accept us, even we hope. Somehow, maybe they'll change a little, swear that. It's hard not to hold. And questions on the table is nobody's family going to change. Today, three stories that it's whether that might be true, act one, so a Jew, a Christian, and a recording crew walking to this bar, and that act the woman travels to Alaska, thinking that maybe her brother might change a little. As he helps the children change a little, swear. Act two. Matching out that's not included. The story of two sisters, now in their 70s, who have preserved the same relationship they had as girls. Better or worse. That's three. The artist formerly known as Dr. Sarkin. What happens when you want your dad to change? And he wants to change. But there is literally nothing that can be done to change him. Let's stay with us. That's one. Julia Pimplers' brother, part went through a dramatic change. And I think it's not exaggerating to say that she wanted him to change that. He's a little. Back to where he was when they were young. And so she said it was a little mission to see him, talk, get his side. And experiment. See if anybody would. Mark and I were very close to him. We were small. We traveled a lot. So we really only had each other for money. months at a time. We have to go on a still and we sometimes remember the time. I got a picture for my earliest memories just a little family unit. I got another I've read it. We were the day. Here we are. We play it on. I don't think we I don't even remember fighting at all until till the year when Dad died. and it's yours. That year was whenever it changed for all of us. We just became very isolated until our separate world. At that point. My brother and I no longer shared a room from that point on. And I don't think we were much of a family unit or we're getting happy with that. Somehow, three of us couldn't make it a family unit again. I would  to talk with Mark about my thought, but it's too late now because he has decided with everything that came before. You were going to get, that's very nice. I was at home and I was in one of my states when I was totally depressed. So I opened the bottle and I told the number what the script was. It was something , why are you... So... just blessed out today in the day of joy. I read that and also I just realized that it was typically an out of all. I mean, it was so, I just felt it so powerfully. I was , I just , I need to put , oh, oh, oh. Inside, , and it is, I guess starting how logically my brother went to UC Berkeley and dropped out and became the one who had a Christian youth. to a small island in the last one to join the film to see. I mean, I was just  on fire. And physically, I was just, I mean, a good way. I was just  this, just blinding  a whole thing. There was no way I could just do something with that. Something big with it. And it caused harm and sadness to a place how the fire we asked them out. Why isn't they said, is that a small island near Juneau? I'm going to get through. from four people, self-sufficient. Hi, dude. They visited themselves, born again, Christians. I went outside, I was , I felt  I felt I moved away. I was looking up the sky and I was just getting the evening and I can see the stars. I was , oh, look at me seeing everything for the first time. And I'm the hacker. At first, when you joined the farm, it almost made us a course because he had been out of the house for several years. , I lost his high school in him away. So we didn't talk about him and he's traveling a lot. And then he was a Berkeley and I didn't hear from him much. And then when he came home one year, he was when he had started to have these words that's experiences and he confided with it. He didn't tell my mother, he could be me, she would be there freaked out and he told me. And so I remember initially feeling really close to him again and very special and happy that he had so his confided. And I kept his secret and we talked about it and long talked about it and I can keep. very relieved that I did not qualify that way. He's telling me. But then over the next few years I think I got more and more involved with the climb. I thought he was part of their world and not part of our world. And his language changed. He was talking about Jesus all the time and turned it and making me fantastic. And then about five years ago, he ended his name in France. Who was living with my girlfriend that was very happy and loving. And actually very excited to share that with him. showing this wonderful life I had now. And he was incredibly judgmental. And they wrote the Bible, we followed by people who said, sex, living with each other, loving each other. He didn't actually want to stay with us. We had stayed for miles, we had to be apartment. And it worked. So I think I kind of met at my life at that point, and I just try to forget that he's never part of my life. I mean very simply I missed my brother, , at some point I realized I had a brother if what and long long ago long to do. I just started to feel  this is really sad and maybe we'll have to be  this. So I'm not going to be going again Christian, go over to you. huge divide with him. But the question became even with the other high did I want to have some conformation shape when I got confident in this? Yes, I mean yes I want to try. what I want. I decided to go visit Mark in Alaska. a sample. Can't stand for no inference. What happens is? fly for, , good 20, 25 minutes. You don't see any kind of interland of Alaska where nobody lives. And then all of a sudden, , there's a few little cabins down below. And you land on this airport that's basically just one landing strip. , that's long as the average is moving. Mall parking lot. And then you're there. Yay! Saw ya! A-A-able heated? I can actually say, this pole value please take you by everybody good flights. Oh no! For many years, I lied about what Mark was doing and the last guys to say that he was the scientist or that he was studying fist farming. I made up a whole bunch of weird things, just because I didn't really understand why he was there myself. I couldn't explain it to other people. Whenever I did say he was part of the Board and Christian community, people it all, it's a call and I didn't know what to say. So I just didn't tell people for a long time and maybe. I had a lot of friends that had for many years. I had a lot of friends that had a lot of friends. I think what I'd come to try to find out and visiting Mark after all of his years was how he gone from being my brother who I went to Hebrew school with and watched him for parapherous by my time. How he had made this incredible transformation. What is he doing there? How can I try to understand it? Better. And... What do you still feel  my brother? Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... When do you  to read the Bible before you go to sleep, huh? Yeah. Hmm... Hmm... Sorry, I didn't... I thought I didn't last. I thought I didn't last. I thought I didn't last. You  to talk about scripture and sort of try to figure out what they meant by stuff. And is it also an intellectual activity for you? Oh no... Oh no... I was a religious monk because he was very naturally talented and he was very creative and he was very intellectual and engaged in our words when he told movie that's not interesting. But what would happen to him? Did that happen? What! Where is he? And that's my last time I thought that there would be being a god. Yeah, ... Well, well, let's see, well, it's... I really don't know if it's a seebook. We're... look about heaven paradise. Well, I really ... Well, I wouldn't think it's a seebook. If I have anything to say, it's me based on what's happening because there's no seegames in the world. Oh, well, you can play things that aren't exactly the same as mine. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. Yeah, being pitted mad? I mean... Yep. Well, the problem is saying, what I'm saying is what I would have to say, we don't believe they said what the Bible is to say, and it was, if what I'm saying is what imagination or within a scavener world, we're wrong, anyway. So you said, You believed that more relevant to me, will you look up something and read it to me at a heart? And if you tell me how you feel about it? But how I feel about it, based on what's in the book and what's in the book and what's in the book, and what I'm not sure it's in the book, I remember on books on English, it's got a pursuit of says. But it doesn't have any other things where, I mean, what's going to say is, I'm saying there is a... and you all have to go there. But you're not going to tell you what it looks . You're talking to the same. Well, it doesn't tell you where it is. Boy, that's the way we get up. When a statement says anything, that might be relevant. You can look it up. We're talking about heaven. We read scripts about heaven. We might give this more of a script. I know what I did now. I asked, but I think I think of heaven. No, I can actually look at the script. It doesn't seem  that. I told for me it's going to be a script. Yes. I'll look it up. No, no, no, no. I don't know what to do though, but you asked me something and I said I don't know why to go look it up. I'm not going to waste. In feminism, I look. It doesn't be a land, the hand look of rights. It's  you read at some point, some something made in person that you're an animated decision about which part you think is what you believe. I mean some people believe in rap, you don't believe in rap, sure. So, all the things, no matter what it says in here, you must have your own opinion. Yes, it is. Another. But mine, I mean the same thing, I mean the same thing, I mean it's not this. And so that's why I want to look it up for the first memory about it to be some more ideas instead of just kind of  saying something I've stopped my head about what little big little bit I remember. , yeah, I can just think it's a personal thing. It is a personal thing, but that's not the first one. I mean, because I make it really, I don't think it is. Do you have any personal zone  that's not viable? I mean, I'm not going to get any of you up for it. I'm in the question. I really get to me to a lecture warrant. Well, no, I am. I guess I just feel  I'm... I mean, you're losing your objective. I'm not objective. I know we're losing your ... What's your job is called? For some, you mean, yes. Totally. Really? You're not paying for it. You're not working with me. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Let's get up. OK. Everything's really unclear, sir. Not wrong with it. Okay. It's totally over. Okay. Okay. Can I do a pet? I do a few. Just few years to it. Not because I can't think he was a little slow. I think the most surprising thing to me was how much even with his new views and how different he was. How? the same he was also. We put running together around the farm and we picked blueberries and then I made blueberry pancakes for everybody in the farm. He played guitar and saying I got to his name. I mean in a way some of I felt  he had drawn this shade down  over a window, , but the window was still there and the shade was Christianity. But it was still him underneath. I mean he was still sarcastic and some of his humor and move very caustic and self deprecating. I mean in a way really stood out. on the farm because he's only one  that. I think that's the main thing that I found is that we could still, , TV each other and we close. I took a mean kick in the stomach for you. Sure. Well, remember that the goalie was twisting an old? I don't remember that. all the kids were so mean at the French school. You descended me. Yeah, that's true. You were definitely a place for each together. I remember reading up John for you. I remember that. Now I do. I remember. See this? Yeah, what's used? What does he do? But that did that work. I think for so many years my mother and maybe two degrees I felt responsible for him having gone off to farm and maybe that's why we did talk about it with the people on my life I've ever been sick. Somewhere in the cell. So I keep that business family or somehow we had done something wrong. he should want to trade in our samples for this new spiritual family. But I think the irony is that only in researching what happened to him, the confounding fact that there, I'm understanding, I think we've now realized there's a lot that we didn't have him to do with the mouse to do with Mark and his life, his demons that he's fighting. So it was only in researching what had brought him to the farm, but it found out things about him that I have no idea. Especially. about the time that we was college, Berkeley. This is something I kind of very, really talk about because, , who wants to write job this kind of stuff, but really, over about six months, I did that, right? It's one of a year, that whole year, I just went home, totally down there. I mean, I'm ever taking a class in college, basically, I don't want to, And I just couldn't have it. I don't know. I don't know what happened exactly. I mean, I can tell you what happened. I don't know why I can't explain it. I think it would happen is I just I took the class not the book that was  this No, and I open the book and I'm and I just could not it couldn't do it And then I never happened that I could set that I would set myself to something and not be able to do it It was  something appear as going wrong. I can see my overhead cross It was very scary And I'd be lost when I could say straight out , mosque. And the person I call in most cognitive roles, we're in almost half of these going, what we thought was. Well, we call it stem to a thousand poems. That was a year ago, we really felt  an emotional. And I went to an... I was asking this sort of my brother. other surrogate mother of her. She's the first person who had contact with her and who long people convinced him to hunt there instead. He had been given a Bible in his reading his Bible and it was soon after that that he had this very unusual experience in the way that always goes filled with giving up his goals. He had the study had gotten involved with a church Christ group there and they were telling that he wasn't safe. that because of this and that and these doctrines and which he didn't even know about anyway, , that and because of his experience is this really wasn't saved So he was in cotton with those that were Christians that were guiding and And then he also just had thoughts that he was we failure, you couldn't make it with God So he said, God, you've got to meet me. You're I'm going to I'm just not gonna go on on this what I'm gonna do even for. So one night, even over to a park, something. There's , oh, so, there's right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. So I just gotta walk every top of this hill. And, , it was even a starting to get dark. I just knew that I was gonna leave until I got that right. So, it was kind of a... Hmm, I knew I had that. Yeah, but honestly, I think most of the line. In the dark, the top of this something. kind of a kill. And he, I don't know what he's thinking, he was going to do some rocks and put himself on a hill. Thinking, I'm either done , not some sentence on myself or kill myself. One of the other. Get himself with rocks. Basically, , I threw myself off the edge of his skull. And I'm not big, but I was to the point where I was either going to, , die or. Right, we're fine got trying. I mean it was there was a real confused date of work, but essentially I did I kind of room myself off the edge and Kind of wound up with the bottom of this precipice minor sling So a little bit little bit and I I just kept praying I also got show me But no And I stayed there pretty much, so I had to read it. At one point, I would just ask somebody, I was waiting. I was waiting, not expecting anything particular, but awesome. Something inside me just started welling up, and it's kind of , Oh. I kind of  I enjoyed it a little bit, I mean, but really enjoyed. I was , I was something happened. Someone was , cut up. I don't know, the warm, the warm thing. And I started speaking in tongues. Just  that. It just kind of , came out. I was , well, this must be speaking in tongues. And I, and then, and I just, once again, the presence of God and just got, I was so, I was just, I felt the presence of Him. And, in a way that was , it's me who was here. You're here. And I've moved you to see it. He was saying, but where is this good friend? I would really stop to be a house, plus this was the right and the wrong. Let me come up off. And I try not to spend too much time thinking about how it all could have turned out differently, but I think this is true. after hearing about how in distress you at the Berkeley, I realized that the pond saved you life in some of it. And I think some of the resentment I felt that you being there got replaced with kind of gratitude that people took a minimum to care at that time and he couldn't have a wooden time to ask. So I think that changed my attitude to this pond. Sometimes it seems  you worked out your issues through religion and I would jump. is she's therapy? Right. I guess one thing that I'm thinking about, that we talked about yesterday is I guess I felt there was an important thing to use to have perspective around my system of beliefs and if I were to seek psychological counsel or have problems that I thought were due to psychological factors or maybe that I wasn't sure how you would see that. if you see all the work I've seen on Evo. experience trying to pull you down or if you think the people of the they can have psychological problems. Well, there's a natural realm of students that got speder. And when in that natural there's just no laws and there are, and so things are going to work. And the napkin working on, , feeling with your emotions and so on. But the spiritual realm is really popular. But if I were really depressed, would you be thinking? thinking it was spirits, oh, what would you think? You really stood on the spirit thing. Yeah, I don't get it, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't believe in it. I don't want to be wondering if you're, okay, , it also took you to the exact end. I did feel  in high school. you always think, you always felt very superior. I was kind of looking down what I was doing. And the irony of this whole conversation is that part of you having this big philosophy. I thought, you're , well, you can do whatever you want to. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right. Well, that's always my hesitation about talking about any of this because I just don't know how to relate it To be without it being something that you're gonna say this is weird, or this is not I can't deal with this Actually, I know where it's the idea. Yeah, okay. Well, unfortunately,  I was It can come off this from the air to say well, this is the way to do the line And that's what you said this I am the way to do it all right and you can't water it now. You can't make it acceptable And it divides, it divides me. But you see that I start laying to accept that your way is a valid way that's just different from my way. And I want to see,  you also see that my way is valid way, just different from your way. Yeah, for... And I know that. Well... They're just as a roof, that. You can't really have to be... You can be... Not really, ... In our day-to-day relationship, sometimes we can actually forget this book. Second, I do. But then we stumble on these landmines that really explode into conflict between us. I really... Can't. I would never be able to say yes and happily currently. I'm having this lesbian lifestyle. I could never say that but I could, but I could, but I never, but that still doesn't change that you almost is good night. Care about it just much day. Always having I still be seeing my sister. I mean, those two things are both true. And it's gonna be a worthwhile because there's no way, there's no, there's no little ground. It's just, it's just, it's hard to make the mood and buy that. We tell about that. We tell you. He had had not got any friends these days. I thought, so I thought, she had been certain of the knot and I did not do that. He certainly would not have done that. He would have done that. He would have done that. He would have done that. He would have done that. So the idea that he adopted the set of value that was proved in a probia, when he wasn't from a probia from the cell, which is very irritating. It did feel  he was about to start something and it didn't have to have. Well, the Bible says God's court is laws in a house. And maybe that's one because that what you're doing is against the law of that. End. as Britain and the Bible, a lot out. And it's in my heart. And so I get those against what's in my heart. And that's maybe that's why maybe it kind of gets me, it kind of makes me feel. Yeah, yeah. I think that was so. When I came to this thing of accepting Christian, it wasn't that I read the Bible and decided, OK, I agree that man is made a man, woman and there's. made that way by God and anything else in the pervert. It's not  I read that and I read some of the other doctors and said, this is what I want. I do this. I mean I accept the Jesus and what comes along with that is what's written for me. I don't know what we have and I just went on. I'll leave that to myself. I mean I can't say it's right, it's mine, okay they are. This is the things that no longer freak me out when I think about one. That talks in tongues. And he has to check with God before he makes any move-all that he believes that there is destiny and God has his all planned out and he's supposed to be recorded for what it is. He would not really think I'd be praying for the salvation and we pray for God to touch the other way to each way. what, and the be Christian in and out. I've had, I don't want to be needed. , here's the person who's been in a period of stress in the room. I'm a master here and my mom and I'm in that period of my life. If we all agreed, they weren't my son. And then another time that thought, what really, what really don't have to offer to us, one proportionally, one for friends, and as a light that she's, , I do it constantly with. And just be thankful to be gone. what is worth the point of praying for them, , , what have got asked off of it? Or what have you got asked off of it? But I don't even need there. I don't see that they'd be any happier if they'd be getting Christian. That's actually ironic that all these years he's taken us on our own terms and hasn't preached and really really didn't take him on his terms. And I think one of the hardest things I had to do is accept that Mark would and let's not weld both sides up again? I'm going to do the same thing as before when I had to learn to love it. When? First of all. Julia Hensler and her brother Mark Mumsler. The audio recordings in her story are confirmed by KMF, which meant that this was a similar from Alaska. I thought the other one again. It's available on the internet at artspinchin.net. In the eight years since we first put the story on the air, Mark has left the grassroots and the events in Alaska. Let's go to school and access. It's now on this first year of residence. He is still a Christian. He is still affiliated with porn. In the eight years since the United Film, he's got married from a man, a rabbi and fat. They've been married. I used to did a call just close in my eyes I hear some of my goals But not my calls that you will not keep in mind I got this But on the phone, on the phone, on the phone When even she starts crying Since I hope you found your friends I get lots of calls for him on the phone Good bird Good bird One of these days when you smile I am amazed In a fair  it's high Now everyone has tried to tell the window I got a bite in town I hope that if you see my Coming up matching Blake blue easy chairs with matching teddy bears sitting on them and What else can happen through relationship with your buddies and sisters does stay the same's of us It's That's a minute I got from a video And it's pretty emotional No Music It's a American light mode. class. Each week on a program of course you choose something in your variety of kind stories on that theme. Today's program, nobody's family is trying to tune. We arrived at Act 2 of our show, Act 2, matching outfits and not included. In this outfit, in this act we consider it the question, what if your relations for the new loved ones, brothers and sisters, never change? No worries, Frank. This story of two sisters. Kearnweinan, goodnight name to booklet we give this little girl that's Me. Back when Dusty and Honey were in their early 20s, not long after World War II, they were shopping in historical learners. They were looking for clothes on opposite size of a circular wrap and found that they'd both pick the same outfit, a green corduroy 2 piece sports suit. They left the store dressed identically and had been dressing alike ever since. Right now I get on my call life fatigue out for said they might yell exercise I'd have pair around the get the summer centers to open cake top and honey what are you wearing? I'm wearing the same thing destiny with the strong brown shorts and the cake pad to shirt. People say why we have the same taste and clothes. So why do I  the same thing she has? I want it, ? So we go through where it. And we're in the same clothes all time I can't say what she's where my skirt or shoes were in my mouth because it'll be the same thing. We're happy to dress in a line. The same way they have the same eye glasses, the same jewelry and but dusty and funny orange ones. Dusty is three years old. than honey. Their bedroom has two twin beds piled with matching stuff animals. Above each bed is a crucifix and above those centered in the middle staring down is a frame picture of Frank's posture. Not only do destiny and honey eat the same food, but they make sure that one never has a larger portion than the other and one will only have a treat if the other is there to share it with her. And if I'm out to destroy no has some time and a deli though. have  samples but she's not there with me, tell me sample, I won't take it. I have to have her with me. I'll go get this month, there's a sample there but I won't take it not  her have. That sounds strange to some people but that's the way we are. And you can't just can't change us. But it works out fine as long as we . within when I heard a new thing. Some people go over to, , I'm not heard any when I'm breakin' it from management and that's the main thing, ? There's a kind of closeness between little girls who are best friends, where it makes you feel secure in state, to think that there's someone who shares all the same lives and dislikes. All you want is to do everything to help. Dusty and funny, and somehow man. to carry that kind of friendship into adults. They're  the girls who write best friends forever on the bathroom wall except for them the forever part is real. It can feel sort of strange visiting them in their house to matching women sitting on matching easy chairs in their living room completing each other's sentences. Even in their jobs we've been together. First a sweatshop then an elderly home for 30. years they worked as Hasky first or a local priest. Is it ever hard to feel  you're a separate person? Yeah, I mean you do everything to all right and you dress the same and do you ever feel  you want to feel  just an individual? Yeah, if I do that I think I'm hurting her. I don't love her anymore. I don't want to do anything  with her. I couldn't do this is why I didn't do that. in your sister took the no dinner for her for  I don't love her anymore and I couldn't do that to me. They would  the big train her. They know their relationship is unusual but when I asked them why it turned out this way they just say over and over that this is what was meant to be and this is what makes them happy. They learn to depend on each other as little girls, growing up during depression, the youngest of six children, often going to bed and green cool. Their father died when honey was two and dusty was five. Dusty was always sort of fragile. For a long time, whenever Dusty and honey went out, honey found herself doing everything for Dusty, because Dusty was too shy to do things for herself . Dusty and honey. lived at home through their early 30s and cared for their alley mother. They watched their older siblings get married one by one. And maybe time they got married had to be called a little bit of a living room and they had a door that went up to the hallway and they should go out that way with the girl. So after they get married, we might have to seal that door up. I said, my high-wrestle, tell us what to do. Never get married, go out that door. Then she sealed that door of my wife or girl between them sleeping at night. You think you're rather wanty to get married? No, I can't say  some other one you're going to get married. She never pressured me so to that, never, never. No. We're going to need to be the stay with one another, ? You just said, yeah, I guess it's in the books. Well, let's do it for a bit. I think in some ways that this relationship is less complicated than married couples. I think so. I think so. Do you understand one another? One doesn't try to hurt the other one. Why or cheat? That's a pretty big deal of it. It turns out that much of destiny and his information about marriage comes from so far. For as long as they can remember, they've been either listened. to so-called radio, or watch me on television. People say there's something to be joined. I think I've got to go move half of the life's daily. It's interesting because your life seems to be very cold and calm and so covers the very turbulent. And watch all that thing, you're so quiet, ? Well, that's how we get our kicks off a life, ? Watch all the sex of life, you wouldn't see TV, ? Because my mother took that was epic, ? You bought a baby, you didn't have a baby, you bought a baby, you didn't. They described themselves as young and hard, and I think that's very scripture. Their nieces have helped them keep up with teeny-bomble culture, for these fears and in-sing, and on the others. Or  the way they can watch moves over to a nice low. I would mind going out with him when we decided to upload 20 issues, you have to go through the dusty puts her hands up, mumbles style and does a little shake. I'll love Ricky Mark. Every night, dusty and funny night under twin beds and talk before they fall asleep. About what they're going to do the next day and what they'll wear. And whether it'll be too cold for their for news. best friends on the sleepover at never ends. Lori Frank is the author of novels that was running at night. I can't tell you. I agree. The artist's probably known as Doctor Shark. Sometimes in 1999, not take a short one. A cut in the nail drawing of head 6 eyeballs, beard to teeth, and in a word blue and bucket, 7 first forms, each of the panograms of the letters of iron, nail grass, wires, sag, sail, rags, alas, rings. Every time I received a stack of artwork, cap for tie, putting a guitar shape wouldn't cutting board. that somebody simply drew on, picked some stamps to it through a nail, possible camps in plus, doesn't the papers of stream of consciousness function, or the work of one John Sunkin. It seems to be crazy, but not so crazy that he didn't provide perfectly organized press buttons that himself, and his fun, and his web address. Talk sometimes in the film. A third John Sunkin, when the idea of the switch show came up, because his family had gone to the chain, dramatic change, but they stayed together. Now, the algorithm for a meditation. Back in 1988, John was a deep in his history. Your classic suburban, how to dedicate it to professional, upper middle class, June. Higher class, more quality in the sense. Then on the golf course one day, he went wrong in his brain, so I took a stroke and surgery where they were part of the cerebellum. Which had pinched something in his life. He wasn't able to do a normal job, and he started doing art. Sess it, primed it soon, fine. that he did in an obsessive primitive sort of way. Turns out in C-step will outside of his body's weak, he walks with a pain, he's definitely left with you. But he's also lost in certain kind of everyday reasoning thinking, in a way that, as you might imagine, affects his family life. For instance, how he gets along with the sun Curtis. He's , a thing that you just have to be, yes. We're going to the beach. And everything, all the beach toys are in this big, best. So I take the basket out and cut the sills, put the basket back into the rock. Wait for a month. I'm , okay, so it's take the basket that don't call the beach ties out and I put the basket back in the garage. Just  yes, you took. And he's , Dad, what are you doing? He said, I just asked me to put the basket back in the garage, Curtis. Dad, we're the... beach toys? I'm so little. I mean, being highly a little more ketchup-litchy. It's horrible. Well John's created from South, the studio where he doesn't start working. The seaside town cost me a lot of shit. This is a dirty little room, dingy junk in the room. The world has wife-estated to the family. It's a pretty suburban-style house. It's so immaculate. It's  a teak where he works. 12, Curtis is the oldest child, Robin's almost 9, Harold is 6, after family dinner one night, that's why he came in and said on the front steps and trees from the middle room. Curtis comes out and tell me how there are so many funny down the stories about the dad. We're way back, back to you when I go. , I told the first story. Alright, that's all. This is a story of how John insisted that they bring the leftover franchise, how he Disney is stories of his, problematic, reputation, and están. Tell me something, and what kind of stuff is that up with the human being? How brought可愛 from the house of Thomas Craig? Is he still missing? Does that thinkign by someone who wants to come to Chicago or have they everables? I wonder what kind of things he is there to tell about. recycled in the conference pile. With a story about John trying to help unpack kitchen and move the house, doing it neatly and wet in hardware money. With a story about John not noticing the camera  got locked outside for a few minutes one winter. Each story makes such a disturbing turn that at one point he says, let's say some positive things about the wall. He starts. He first came home from hospital, wasn't  laughing  crazy. I had a moment to work. First sitting in the couch watching cartoons and me to making us join the sitting on the floor and who was roaring. It was making us hurt. To me roar. And I thought to myself, oh gosh. What a funny call. Because he was  a little kid and living with John at that time was  living with a teenager. The way teenagers are. It's slow, and irrational, and moody. He was all the states. It's mom. So that was the tough time, but he did continue to get better. So he's got some sort of things. So yeah. Yeah. Pretty says he was seven right. He understood the extent which is that was not the end. I mean, the plane is about to stop, rob, middle-chop, send-ball. Robin would get mad at me or Curtis for seeming to be so impatient with Dad. And Curtis and I would sort of look at each other and roll our eyes to think. We'll know soon enough why we're so impatient. And now Robin is to the age where she's feeling impatient with John and Carol and his great friends and runs to defend. I know that with him. and come here, she'll be more aware of it. At this point, Kim says, sits your eyes just realized that, wonder that, she gets mad. These scribbles are so number-on in times, when invited to be quickly, they'll end their house on the birthday. He just is not aware of how they people's rooms and then he wants to go away. When he does play with the kids, so, let's do this for help. The de-severment you go too far, get to laugh. Sometimes comes out, comes out, , get time to metal- of game and he starts making up rules for them to follow on there in the middle of there. But here since you're still rolling up, go down the skateboard, sitting down, you can't ask, you can't get up until you're in the bottom of the hill and he makes up rules and he doesn't even care to them that kids don't want them to be doing the rules to do this thing because we have them сидish with us but we ask a proper learner I'm skateboarding. kids being kids. Don't want to. Do you think it's one of kids? Does he embarrass you? Yeah. He wants to be friends. We'll make some other tricks. John's second, Spader Days, and more steps. It is possible for him to focus on normal, real good, clear headed. Please, as it gets exhaust, we have now. sometimes when he tries to do the right thing, he gets his wrong. I should point out here that when John had a stress, Kimini had only been married two years, her sister stayed in a robbing town and had to go on. He came to say that not only to remain with him, he had more children. She didn't, she says, because first doctor she predicted for recovery, and then every year, he did get better for a long time. She loves to respond more. And so I started talking to myself, well, if John did. It's better, it'll be nice first to have it on the menu because sort of new hope and it won't be space to part part. And if it doesn't be better, you can see your own first signature. See, I'm also going to start with the first one. We decided to never spend half of that in the story. When you're proud to stay together, sit and help, you do wonder what is something to happen. That's something to say to you. But you don't think what if you're pregnant just suddenly changes into something else? Someone very good in it. Sometimes it's you can still pride in something, lean on in a certain way. But there are plenty of ways that she can. Which, the other standards. We, with the titan very close for you. I would have to say closer than musics. No. ... Lessons. And do you think your kids are a huge thing for the names of the titans? But... I still do. I still yearn for change, , and no offense. Chris is there for a few of you to , but... he shouldn't have been. I tell that a while. But I know that he really can't help it. Just try and go to the other side of the number that and I dig the else sometimes. She should know better than you just, only know the else you're talking about. very perfect. Do you think he might share something? No, I don't. He's been after this life for a long time and I don't. He's been trying to save the seed, he's trying to save the seed and then it ends up  that. I think that was what he was. Yeah. Look at drones, brought baby to Seattle, and then did nothing. We wanted to look a... now, you settle down, did nothing. Didn't live in John the Party, and then after we had already done presents, in fact, go in and he says to me, ''Pretty, what are we doing first cake or presents?'' and they had already done presents and we were just about to start cake. So, it's hard. After the party, everybody was planning up, trying to special bouquet of healing and birth this better part He thought he was helping. What happens in the second family is that happens in any family. It is hard, the rest of them not to think, despite themselves. It doesn't even love us, it doesn't even love us enough to act differently. And that's where we get upset and think he should know that the healing means important. He should know that that drawing I made is important to draw. He should know that. He says, no, I don't. It's more I think that sometimes. and it is hard to distinguish when he's using it and when it's really a perceptual. My wife is , well, Juni, I think you're lazy because you use the stroke as excuse. I can't tell if you're really just being lazy. And sometimes she is right. Sometimes I am lazy. Sometimes action. to do it. just  we can't remember where the light switch is. I've turned light sign a thousand times and I tell her I really can't. She says yes you can't. No I can't. Well, guess what? I'm not in the room. I'm just hanging on you. I want him to care more. I would think that no matter how bad your situation is. We've got these three marbles children in the next place and nice home and , I mean, things aren't that bad for us. And I know that life is really hard for John's side. We would be  it. We were more of an inspiration for him. That part I can't let go. change. And so this is where this sound, doing my brief visit with the circuit is John Wise and everybody says on his best paper, but anything can tip out around where he did he mess things up, and everybody said the paper in the kitchen. Produces little sisters needed help with X&TV, was peristaking to top that. Interestingly, him says that some of the nicest times you heard or they visit with his family. Smiles, bread and sister. Family rules are so powerful. Some kids in the job. I love just sitting around and listening to him talking to his friend, he's a sister. Because the old John seems to come back. But he's also exhausted after those trips because... And so he's... His piece... Seaving them or anything. He... He wants to be the old John too. But he can only be so much. When we call the circuit's the speed to turn that the family is still together, he's still married. Girls are teenagers. Girls are especially college. And John Bitton is the great one. If I could only win you alone, I'd make them close to everything. I'm probably where you're waiting for my heart on tip or straight on dream of way. I've been this produce today but Julie Snyder and myself, that's Robert Susan Burton and Bruce Shevny, and we get it as a show. Talk, chat, hit, mind, be rock on these people and Nancy update and console your answer about, but I should not come to set them on the new set. There's a thanks day in David Rackoff, please feel a bit in jail, global, for need of possible children's blood. us, as it is the Katie Shepherd, and all of them will be fine. I will say we can get a free weekly podcast where you can listen to any of our shows, perhaps we can get a free www.lismaricinlife.org.
