Let's say to this story, afterward we're two, Nuremberg Trials, Documented German Warcramed Trossies, and the Holocaust. The Germans didn't accept it. Historians have noted that, as far as the Germans were concerned, Nuremberg wasn't real justice, which has been about sighted, coming in after the war, and posed in victors' justice. It wasn't until the 1960s, when the Germans held their own home ground. The Germans were the only Jews who were being disbanded and reduced theImasseting threat. The German Warcramed mailbox should be 65 zobaczycią for crime trials. The Germans were forced to face with their damnation during war. And even that wasn't right. As one writer put it, it took an accumulation of a million school visits, concentration camps, a thousand books, the Hollywood television series Holocaust, a vast molecular reckoning between generations, still going on. WB EZI Chicago, System American Life, My Regardless, Today on our program, how to come to peace with past. Stories of people running toward and running from the truth and shame, act one, international justice, and entire nation coming to grips with past. Actually, not coming to grips with the ends. Act two, juvenile justice, criminals face the past, juvenile criminals, report from staff carrier, act three, everyday. justice, ordinary New Yorkers confessing their sins quietly in public. At one, by ever since the end of World War II, there's been this idealistic notion kicking around that when nations through horrible things, the best way to deal with it, but this thing's to rest, to be that of a court somewhere, a court for war crimes, crimes against humanity. Enough of the crew. First time since the Normburg and Tokyo trials at the end of World War II, I quote this is actually in Session. This is the War crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Just  the Normburg trials, this is just this administered by outsiders. These trials are happening far from the Balkans, they're in hate, and none of them. Their warriors in Judd, Egypt, and France in Sri Lanka and Canada and lots of Americans there. Kitty Faudi is a familiar voice to public radio listeners or a coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial and Rodney King beating trial. But over the course of the last year she spent several weeks in the head, watching this new form of justice. Gabby O'Curcmit Donald is arguably the most powerful African-American woman in the world, which probably never heard of her. Medellin is the presiding judge for the first international war crimes trial in half a century. And she sits in her judicial robes week after week inside the courtroom, and becomes clear that judgment Donald is  most Americans when it comes to things foreign. We can't read the maps. am Mr yolk thoroughê BR from Bosky Samage, maybe, was he somewhere up there, as I recall. We don't know the history, and we have the devil at the time pronouncing the names. The witness. Mr. Gross, Gross, and that. Gross and he testifies. But judgment Donald also brings to the tribunal another American attribute for idealism. I love the law. I  solving problems, and I think for certain duration minority I think. that the use of our laws in the United States is the way that we bring about equality and inclusion. And McDonald isn't the only American working at the Tribunal. By the time you left of Stina, period or about 90% of the Muslim community have been killed, forced out. Prosecutor Alan Tegar is on loan to the Tribunal from the Department of Justice. About two dozen American lawyers and investigators and other ex. experts have been scundered or loaned out to the tribunal. There's salaries paid by the US government. Americans make up the largest legal community at the tribunal. The contingent is so large, some complain that through sheer numbers, the turning what's supposed to be a brand new legal system into something that looks a lot  US constitutional law. Most of the Americans are here out of a sense of moral conviction. Alan Teeger, White Judge McBall, was a civil rights lawyer. He was one of the pros. at the federal, rot-necking feeding trial. His parents were holocaust survivors. The prosecution's chief investigator Terry Bowers since he came to the haig to do work of significance to human kind. But from the start, his new job presented challenges he never faced in his old position as head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. I mean, when we went into Tuzla, we flew into the airport and the next morning, the serve started showing airport. we weren't even able to get out of where you have to dodge our cellary and some areas you just can't get into. Immediately we knew that we were up against any enormous challenge, but these cases together. There were all sorts of challenges and one thing in particular that Americans and other non-Ugoslobs at the Tribunal found so very difficult to understand. But now familiar stories of neighbor turning against you, almost overnight. Judge McDonald asked witness after witness about this over and over again. I guess my question, perhaps it's not fair question. I don't know that you could give a complete answer, but perhaps it can help me to understand since I am not from that area. How could you explain that some of the atrocities that we've heard were Kevin committed? How can you explain that something  that would happen? Give in your background, give in your experience knowing that serfs and Muslims live together, want to school together, enter married, how did it happen? She never found an answer that satisfied her, and as the trial war on, she and other judges found themselves searching for something in their own experiences to explain it. And that raises this question. What does it mean when people with one sort of history are trying and judging people with a very different sort? She can't do that. National Criminal Chief and All for the Farmer Yugoslavia is now in session, for the National International for Lexi Yugoslavia at the very end. Please be seated. It was back in May of 1993, with the United Nations Security Council set up the tribunal at the urging of the U.S. and Western Europe. At the time, NATO was resisting police from the Bosvians to come to their aid in the war. And cynics suggested that the West set up the tribunal simply be... because it was easier to commit lawyers than troops. Some people feel that the tribunal was created as kind of an apology because the world community wasn't doing anything. Again, Judge McDonald, I don't care. I don't care what their reason was. The point is that we have been established. And I think that we're making a contribution. But to see just how difficult it is to make a contribution, consider the case of witness out. The Tribunal allows witnesses who fear for their lives to testify behind closed doors their identities kept secret. Witness L explained to the Tribunal that he was a guard at one of the serve-run prison camps where he witnessed the Tribunal's first dependent of Bosni and Serb-Purati teacher named Doosantatech, the myth war crimes. The prosecution had other witnesses who told of Tatech delivering brutal beatings, but L was the only credible witness who sought Tatech rape and kill. people. L testified about one incident where 10 elderly men were taken into the infamous White House, seen most tortures at the Omask Prison camp. According to L, Tadach pointed to him and said, come here and perform the killing of these 10 prisoners. L answered, why me, why do I have to do it? Tadach apparently go inpatient. L said Tadach approached the prisoners and shot two of them in the head when he applied. It was dramatic, damning testimony, the strongest. brought forth about prosecution. Unfortunately, he wasn't true. Two months after Elzanyshal Court appearance, prosecutors had a stand before the court, and admit that El had lied on the same. He had never been a camp guard, never witnessed the alleged atrocities he'd never even seen do some totagent person until he walked into the courtroom. Prosecution investigator Robert Reed told the court, Elzanyshal was a posse named Serb Soldier, said he finned. caught by the Bosnian Muslim army, and then was coerced in detestifying. He said that after he's initially interviewed by the military he was transferred to Sarayava, where he spoke with police interrogators for seven hours a day, for about one month. The purpose of these conversations was to try, with the cell, to give evidence against which got attached. And then asking why he pleaded guilty to something that he had never done, and he stated that he'd been threatened that if he did not co-operate with the Bosnian. authorities. That he be executed. In the week since Ben, the prosecution says its uncovered new evidence that shows the bossy and served government didn't coach with himself. At this point, it's unclear what to believe of his testimony, and the whole episode raises disturbing questions for Americans and Western Europeans, first pushed for the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal . If these trials were designed to get it to truth, they were being tainted by a witness who lied. If they were trying to bring justice to the victims, it was those victims, the Muslims in this case, who were fabricating evidence, trying to swing the verdict their way. The accused would you rise please, and state your identity, Mr. Dmitry. Pragent, F.D.M. of which I was born in Tuzla in 1971. I am a Crelat by National. Thus far the tribunal has only handed down one sentence. It's a case where no one disputes the basic facts of the crime. This was the case of draws in your demovage. The story of a man who risked his life and his freedom to tell the world the truth about what he'd done. Her demovage is 25, a baby-faced kid with acne scars. His Croatian, his wife, is a surre. They have a young son. Her demovage was trained. and is a tool in diemaker. By the time he had learned his trade, the war had broken out, so he became a career soldier, and served with all three armies during the war. But he says he chose combat units that conducted reconnaissance missions and man border checkpoints. Jobs where he didn't have to kill anyone. Until July of 1995, that's when special battalion, the Bosnian Sir Barmy, attempts sabotage unit, was ordered to a farm field near Pilitsa. It was shortly after the fall of Shrapuk Nitsa, the UN had set up a safe area there, which 25,000 Bosnian Muslims had fled for protection. But when the Bosnian Serbani attacked, the tiny UN force didn't offer much resistance. In fact, UN peacekeepers helped load Muslim men onto buses, took them away, never to be seen again. Their damage and his unit had been given instructions on how to kill large numbers of people in a short period of time. then the buses started riding. The first group of ten were blindfolded, their hands tied behind their backs. A dame of itch in his comrades were then ordered to shoot the prisoners in the back. I was sorry for those people, simply. I had no reason to shoot at those people. They had done nothing to me. But a dame of itch empty-dice rifle again and again, killing as many as a hundred of the 1200 killed that day. For sure, I'm assuming. Your honor, I had to do this if I had refused. I would have been killed together with the victims. When I refused, they told me, if you're sorry for them, stand up, line up with them, and we will kill you too. A Demovitches unit was then ordered to amere by town, or perhaps 500 other bossy Muslims were being held inside a meeting hall. He and his unit were ordered to kill them as well. A Demovic says this time, he did refuse saying, wasn't there enough blood weren't there enough dead people. A Demovic says he didn't care what happened to himself anymore. Told American prosecutor Mark Harmon, I didn't want to become a robot for extermination. Are you able to estimate how many people you've killed? I don't know exactly I can't estimate but to be quite frank. I'd rather not know how many people I killed. A Demovitch's refusal to kill again did not go unnoticed by his comrades. A few days later in a bar fight one of them shot him four times. Her Demovitch said it was because they knew he couldn't keep his mouth shut. And he couldn't. Demovitch's after the massacre he couldn't sleep. Stay away from home and drink. After he had partially recovered from the gunshot wounds, he says he finally decided to tell his story to the war crimes tribunal, but there was no tribunal representative anywhere nearby. So he went to the American Embassy in Belgrade. They gave him a list of news agencies. He called the first one on the list and told his story to a stringer for ABC News. Unfortunately, the phones were tapped, and the reporters' tapes were confiscated at the airport. their damage was quick. rest, but not before he talked to another report with the Paris Daily Paper La Thigaro. His story at the Pilates' massacre was translated and retold all over the world. Her demavic eventually made his way to the tribunal and we told her story again. I just want the truth to be known and for someone to understand that this actually happened and how these people had lost their lives because as we heard today, nobody knew about the place of Pilates. said that a crime had happened there and what kind of crime? Perhaps that's where most people were killed. And to have someone believe me that I really had to do it that I didn't want to do it. That's why. Judges deciding, as case, had a difficult time understanding how our Demovitch got himself in such a no-wion situation, by didn't he just flee the country? Your Demovitch explained, he couldn't get a passport until you'd complete it your mill. territory service and by then the war at Broken Out. Egyptian judge, poet Riyat, questioned why he kept enlisting in the army. He pleaded very much the cause of peace. At the same time, you happened to join all the fighting groups during this war. Was there any other way to express your belief in coexistence? How shall I put it? We were forced to join the army. I had received the scholar papers I had no one to turn to. Who was, obviously, the simple drussian edema which with nobody who would listen to me. Edema which go increasingly frustrated at the judges' questioning. He cried several times on the stand. At one point, he and the French. judge quad-jord began shouting at each other in their native languages, either one waiting for translation. I think I'm a person who says, I don't understand me. My wife is a surm. Was I supposed to... Hey, Ter because she was a Serbian. I apologize, but let me explain this to you. I do understand this, but this is the 12th time that I'm repeating my story. The story of how my life has been destroyed. Please try to understand me. This is the 12th time I'm doing this. Her death of it even pulled up a shirt to show the two-foot scar on his belly. The result of several operations to repair damage done by his comrades bullets. bullets. Judge Jordan was unmoved. I understand that it's painful for you. We understand that you would call it in a storm. But that is not a reason for us just  that to say that these many, many people would kill simply will be written off. Prosecutors say they never would have known what had happened to those 1200 victims. If your death of a chet not come forward. Yet the tribunal judges sentenced him to 10 years behind bars for him. role in the killings, dismissing his claims that he had no choice but to shoot. The judges said they only had his word on it. So here the tribunal has sentenced its first war criminal. The kid they have encased at the only because he chose to come forward in Tally's story. And yet the criminal who gave the orders to shoot has not even been charged with the crime. And while General Raccoon Lottich, the military man at the top, has been indicted. He liked dozens of other entided work. criminals remains a free man. Does this justice punishing only the small fish? The Weas are worth the Canadian chief prosecutor to try and look at its angry when their demivic is described as a little fish. How small a fish can you be when you're prepared to admit to the killing of 100 people? By any national standard, this would be the biggest crime in the history of that country. And so I find that level of cynicism a bit disconcerting the people. or saying, well, don't waste my time with mere killers of hundreds, I'd  to see killers of thousands. Which brings us to the biggest problem facing the tribe and not. Unlike most criminal justice systems, the Tribunal has no police force to be its own. And so it has no way of bringing cute Jews to justice. The Yugoslav Tribunal has indicted 75 people so far. One has died, seven are in custody, and the rest are working and living free in the former Yugoslavia. Before the den of Khotem, the daughter of the the Bosnian Serbian and Croatian governments are supposed to hand over and die at work criminals living in their territories. Rare exceptions this has happened. Under date NATO troops are also authorized to make a rest of any indicted work criminals they encounter. The joke is tribunal, that NATO troops have to cross the street not to run into them. If the international community doesn't follow through with its commitment to the tribunal, if the United War criminals are allowed to remain free, it sends exactly up. opposite message from the one Americans at the Tribunal were hoping to send. It says essentially, the future characterizes a melodicist who commit any atrocities they want, and the world won't bother to bring them to justice. The Dutch  most Europeans are not particularly churchgoing people. Every small town boasts a beautiful cathedral, but it's usually empty. When a holiday called to the Pinkster and World Around, when london. day, none of the locals in the court knew what it was. Many foreigners had a consultant with surgical calendar to find out he was the second day of the country cost. So here in the midst of this rather secular society, he's a child about another society where religious divisions became a matter of life and death. And in this setting, those who come to work every day at the tribunal are the truly faith. The world community won't arrest the criminals they indict. As if at the war. or don't seem particularly interested in the truth about it. The international media ignores what they're doing. But still, the lawyers and the judges come in, salmon evidence they work on their cases. Troublesievers in the idea that the rule of law is the only way to create a lasting peace. Sitting there day after day, I remember the oldest, lamin' proffer that says one hour of doing justice is worth a hundred and prayer. They come to this brick temple. a courthouse every day to do their praying by working for justice. Even if no one hears their prayer. That's story by Kitty Feldy. There's this remarkable essay about Warcrime's trials and National Truth Solutions by Michael Dodio and current issue with index on censorship. Ignania is writing a book on Truth and National Reconciliation. He's examining the Warcrime's trial on Hague and from Wanda and Truth Commission's in Argentina and Chile and South Africa, the situation in Ireland. And in the sense that he writes, it's open to question whether just... Justice Truth actually heals. The one thing he says, what you see as the truth depends on who you are. He does this story. In June of 1996, he was as the chariot discussion of historians, Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia. And all these ended people who opposed the war, the most impacted in the post-transport. And they hadn't given into the national hatreds and plain by the way they remained friends. And I got them round with jable and I asked them at one. point. Don't you think it would be possible for you all to get together and produce a history of the war? It is a simple matter of how this catastrophe happens in your free society. Those are kind of destiny assignments after I made this mobility and well-meaning proposal and people then just then a common history is impossible. We couldn't do it. We couldn't even agree what event should be included. It couldn't even agree on when the war began. I mean, some people think the war began in June 1991 when the J&A tanks, , marching the Slovenia, other people think the war began in, , 80s, 5 and 80s, 6 when , serving nationalists began to take off. And a simple factual questions become in other words, questions that attribution of responsibility and questions that give. I mean, it'll take generation. And I'm not. sure that outsiders do it. It's  a family, trauma, and as a family, they will have to talk it out. But it will claim, , 30, 40, 50 years. So would you make a dismissal of the Americans and the other partners who are fortunate to have been with it? Okay, we're going to get it true. Well, I think I don't want to be cynical about that because I think it will really go through this terribly important thing. And I think outside is can play a limited role. Isn't outside it say, here are the four-in-six facts about certain work on it. And we can establish the international survey, who can establish what work on is happening to where, by human tools, there's no guarantee that that tool will then reach out to the body of ours, but at least it constitutes one kind of place, somewhat, where honest men can find what actually happened. Yeah, but it's just a first step. Absolutely, for a step in, , I would be naive to think that one that's trying to be in a wine puppet's working for so many years, and I'm in all the volumes of evidence published that this is of itself, and it makes much different. I mean, the really scary, I think, is the sentencing which, , a lot of Serbia, and I think Croatian society, the conclusions that even the evidence of the Pangegrb discounted before it's even heard, , it's kind of alien, , and the meaner. understand this but our self that can not know one of the standards or the service but no one understands the class but the class no one understands the Muslims but the Muslims and therefore anything the international tribunal says to them has to be wrong. It's such an interesting contrast to a place in South Africa where as you pointed out in your essay you have former adversaries actually sitting down trying to create a government trying to create a nation where all sides presented and so when may sit down for truth commission and sell ups not outside of this place. themselves because they are ready to reconcile and be part of process reconciliation. There's a place where that truth is going to go and you can actually help them back there there's ready to work. If there's no tragedy in the Balkan, there's no moment, there's no place for the truth to go because the regimes that are in power all come and prove the movement of the country. We're not regimes which really allow and welcome to let the truth. and then totally off. , the age of a view of will be crying in the wilderness. In his essay, Michael is not your princesses. It comes to terms with the past to entire nations, have to go through the same psychological processes that a person goes through. When they face the past. Now, there's this, you have to be a moment of admitting the truth, admit it guilt, admit it shame. Do it with a few of those moments, very different setting, admit it. hih It's this American life, America. Last, each week at a program of course, which is theme, bring you radio, monolids, miniature documentaries, pound tape, anything we can think of on that theme. Today's program, what puts past the rest? We are at Act 2, kids. This program is not too sunny or sunny, but it's basically through the reason teenagers do so bad when the juvenile justice system. They said they're trying to victim, not by their peers, but by the teeny, By adults, outside of it. Scott Carrier visited a Tucson courtroom set up with the premise that teenagers who be tried and convicted by the teenagers. I'm guilty. One minute into the first trial, the prosecuting attorney stands up to examine the witness. She's beautiful, a knockout blurred in a tight black cashier sweater. She's maybe 17, but in Tinkorn everyone has rolled play, and she plays the prosecuting very well. Why didn't you go to your room? Was the question that you were turning asked you and you can't answer that? Why didn't you go to your room? You have no idea why you wouldn't go to your room The boy on the stand is 12 still with baby fat here's look back to look cool His crime was the pile of false reports in our anymore. I said his mom was getting it Do  what nine one one is he's half What is it? It's an emergency only at the phone call,  if there's an intruder in the house or someone really is abusing you to point out where you're scared for your life. Do you think this fits into an emergency? I mean now that you can think about it, do you think that you should have called them? Yeah. The mother tells me her son is a Tahuna, an old-em-Indian, that she adopted him when he was five, and then he's always been angry, angry at her, angry in a lot of days. They got into an argument, boy said, why don't you just hit me? Go ahead, hit me, and she did. She slugged him in the arm, and the boy called 911. No bachelor in 15 courts in 30 states around the country, and their numbers increase in rapidly, because they seem to work. In Tucson, the recidivism rate, kids ago from King court is only 8%. Compared with 37% kids who go through regular juvenile court or similar or minor offenses. The social workers, judges, lawyers, and policemen who work in volunteer for teen court are convinced that it's a good program. They surround the kids with attention, try to show them that they care, that there's a whole community that cares. But if you ask them why it works, they usually say it's the jury process of having the kids explain themselves and their actions to a jury of their peers, other teenagers. and then hearing the response that this has an unusual, even amazing rehabilitative effect. In this case, however, this part of the process seems to be more about shame. Are you aware that you provoked your mother to hit you? It sounds to me  you provoked her, didn't you? Why would you watch your mother to hit you? Blonde. So, I was  an experimentation you were testing your mother to see if she'd actually hit you. Why would you do that to somebody, especially in my life? In theory, if things were to go as flat, the boys offender, as breaker of a law, should tell the jury that he recognizes his responsibility for the offense and its consequences, and apologizes and say he'll try not to do it again. But instead, I understand, he decides that maybe he wasn't so wrong in calling 911. on that this wasn't the first time his mother hit him and she hits his little brother too. This is a mistake and in a closing argument the prosecutor asked the jury to remember that the boy is not sorry that he isn't admitting his responsibility. The jury is comprised of 18 agents, seven of them have been in team class before defendants and their serving jury duties. their sentences. The eight jurors of girl who's doing this for credit at a private school, she's eager to be the formant of the jury. She speaks right up and asks if there are any objections to her being the four person and no one objects of course so she gets right down to it. I think she at the self-steam roof sucks. It really seems  he needs that he called 911 for a really no reason. Because of kids I can't  kids he wants you to have this attention. ... usually say about teenagers. The way he acted in there is  not except was I think he doesn't have a spirit for anything and he doesn't take the seriously. I think his parents had them enough or something. He doesn't want to even listen to his mom and nothing and he don't hear what he has to have to grow up at attitude and make he just he don't care what anybody thinks. They should just show them... that he needs to expect his parents more, which she doesn't. So when his mom says to go to his room, he should do it instead of saying hit me more hit me. Everyone's saying he should have respect for his elders, but I mean we don't know what happened before he started provoking her. I mean  if she was starting pressing a hand or something, I mean she should have respect for him too, and it's both ways. This girl's 13 years old and really pity. She's been in pain. quite twice already. Once per possession of marijuana, and again for hitting her mother, domestic violence. Oh, we don't really know what, , what really goes on in that house. So we can't say that that was the first time he was hit. Maybe you got hit  a lot of time before. She's the only jurors to try to see things from the boys point of view, most likely because she's been there. She really is, it's appeared. She gets into a lot of trouble, fights without the mother. She argues for the defense, but the others will have none of it. He's guilty and is not sorry. He needs to be taught less. Surprisingly, it turns out that the Beteek girl, even though she seems to understand before, she's willing to punish him just as much as any of the others. I ask her how she would help the boy, and she says she will reduce. Are you sitting on a jewellery for my couple days? Have you been to Juvie? Yeah, for just a couple hours. Was it? What was it? I'm just keeping away from his parents for a little bit and now he could see that if it happens again, he'll know where he will be. I've been told that teenage jurors are notoriously more harsh in their sentence than regular juvenile court judges. That perhaps this is because teenagers are being asked to act as adults, and they know from experience how adults act in these situations. Adults punish. or perhaps the kids from experience know what really works is to make it heard. The organizers and administrators of Team Court try to discourage the idea of punishment. They try instead to encourage corrective sentencing that will help the kids teach them, not hurt them. There's the minimum sense consisting of jury duty, letters of apology, and a basic course in responsible decision making. But the jury can. if it decides the defendant needs additional corrections. Require that he performed manual labor, such as painting over graffiti, or making a tent and successfully complete a self-esteem workshop. 5. One-and-a-half-hour sessions in which they learn skills for non-violent problem solving and increasing belief in internal versus external control over life events. Topics include identification and expression of emotions, anger, safety planning, and personal power. In this case, the case of the boss report, since they cannot send the boy to prison, they send him to self esteem workshops, to for good nation, and give him a day's labor community guard. The next trial concerns a 13-year-old in this cop with a smoking hole, the marijuana pipe out behind the school. He's been suspended for five weeks, and his dad tells me this is excessive punishment. Not constructive at all, because the sun is just missing out on his classes, just sits at home all day. He says he thinks the King Court system is a good, better than the juvenile court. But basically, he just doesn't  seeing his son put through the ring by any one other than himself. On the stand, his son says he's sorry, that he knows he did something wrong. He gets emotional, nearly starts crying. And it looked over at his dad, and he's just 80. His son is 13 years all, the big for his age. His son is 13 years old. starting to be a man. It is son, has just been changed in public. This time in the jury, we're nearly everyone is in favor of letting it defend and off easy. The private school girl wants to send it to self-esteem classes, but no one else seems to agree. That, that, that doesn't have enough to do it. I mean, it doesn't have a lot of self-esteem obviously not. off the scene which is not just so- I know but all that's going to be it's quite a class that's going to be something we watch is saying watch is the clock all time and go to the scene and make everybody participate if I saw on the street just the way he lives but he just lives but she knows that he gets high from now he has lost me and pretty sure that all of us except for probably one person have used marijuana so we all know how it feels and you all of us have lost all the scene no okay there's it During Monitor and I wrote a professional social worker who's overseeing the deliberation. And it seems  things will not go into the direction she'd hoped for. She tries to move the kids to a decision by taking a phone. She counts for in favor of self-esteem, in court against. But I count for against one in favor, and three who will not say one way or the other. It turns into a discussion about who needs self-esteem, how to measure it. And then maybe they don't even know what's supposed to be me. Then the little girl comes up with an idea. She asks that the defendant is ever tried to commit suicide. I'm wondering if he's in a dead criminal suicide. I mean, people that try to that, try to bear a low self-esteem. And is he ramen glass? Yeah, because that's what you call a low self-esteem. Okay, I'll be right back. While the social workers out of the room, I ask for kids what they really think about male models. No, we had a party or something. I thinkvin' a \"-digigigimez\"- This is your more. more chest to die and thinking, hi. But yeah, what is the rest of you did bust? So? No, anymore. You can't really think bad about people because there's lots of different people that use them different reasons. Just different stuff. I mean, the guys, they're , you can't even hear anything. They're all the hot to know. Yeah, if you had a chance, you would have probably the one. Yeah, the one. And the ones are all of it. This is a bad person. This is a bad person. This is a bad person. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I think it's high. That's not a good thing. It's a good problem. It's better. But it's not just a small. It's society's problem. So we are put. We are part of society. And we're right in here. So he doesn't grow up doing it. And he can be a bigger person. The one girl who's in outside are here. The one who goes to a private school. If he doesn't grow up. and it becomes clear that everyone else sometimes against me. I'm the only kid in my neighborhood to do doesn't do it. It's at my school. I got to have a school. I got to have that. Yeah, I don't go to a private school. I'm the only child in the eighth grade. It doesn't do. Because I've had enough stuff to do. I want to go to college. I don't my brain to turn in a much,  what, but though, you can't. I went to a study at the school. I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I've done it, . And I do, but I don't, , I still, I'm going to graduate this year. And it's there. I mean it's stupid maybe that I do have a best. I don't understand whatever it is. I mean I've smelt it. through high school I'm still graduating this year. But just because he smokes weed, doesn't he? He's going to have a bad life  she said. But do you want to take a chance of walking? I've been growing up smoking more smoking weed. Weed is the gateway drug. The social worker comes back in the room and tells them that the defendant has never tried to kill himself. Because his self has deemed seems intact, because his crime is one of the most of the jurors have committed themselves, because they are united against the private schoolgirl they give him a minimum of service. In the third trial of 14-year-old girl on the stand for physically assaulting a former friend. The former friend had been spreading a room in the sheet, the friend, had slept with the 14-year-old girl's boyfriend. She said the boyfriend got her pregnant. The 14-year-old told her to stop, but she did it again to another boy and another girlfriend. So the 14-year-old girl went over to her house, pulled her buyer hair off the front steps and into the yard, hunched during the face. Her defense attorney tries to get her to say she's sorry that she won't. do it again. Why did you do it? Bad temper. What do your feelings now about? What should I do? It really doesn't bother me because I didn't care. Take it back, so. Thank you, no further questions, honey. Thank you, you're on a... You lost your temper and got into a fight, right? Guess you're provoking. If I want that peel  this, I start... and talking massive crap to your face. Would you hit me because I provoked you? Maybe. Maybe. It doesn't bother you now that you got to fight. No. No. No. This fight is everything. It doesn't make the difference. It happens in the result where you have some sort of meditation. Yeah. It's not nothing. It's not  getting shot miles down the plains that I hear from you see us that I who 되는 aliens is if she marks me. So you guys said, love. Whether there's a gun and knife or dying involved, fighting is against a lot. Just  snow cave. Just  everything else. Just  killing. So you guys said, love. Just do something  that. That's why you're here today. Can you tell us, Jerry, that you're not going to fight again? We love you. This trial has a different jury. When they debate, no one mentions the statement by the defense that in her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing. No big deal. deal with. It either just blow with her heads, but it doesn't make any difference to them. The most important thing for that is that the dependent feels no remorse as supper of no shame and  the first jury. So now there's certain that change is the essential ingredient. The first step in changing the criminal into a good citizen. She is at full battle about it at all, you guys. girl. Yeah, my friends and the survivors team. Yeah, come and introduce one. Oh, I sure want to be three. Yeah, sure. People get a little bit of care,  she just sits there and makes you feel good. I think she's going to have some steam workshop at the open time. Yeah, you can't thank you for sharing your stories to cash on me. Yeah, I'm too much trash-ass. I would do that. You're going to do that. Most members of the jury have already been through the workshops. They know what the right answer is. They get excited, they write the comments. Yeah, she needs to hear, she's  feeling so fast. Okay, we feel that there will be people at 9 and 2, your whole life to you. But you can't get them all up. Okay, we have to grow up all over. It's first got on. My emotional All that's good. After they delivered the sentence that comes down off the stand, and I ask if she wants to talk to me for a moment. But she looks at me, as if she'd  to rip my throat out,  where's my knife when I eat it. She's not been shaped. In her neighborhood, fighting his and everyday, a way of life, a way of staying alive. Nobody understood what she was saying. We can say what I'm on. We can say what I'm on. I thought we were out of the courtroom, but down the hallway to the room where she'll have her exit interview. I watched her sit down at a long wooden table, surrounded by social workers, police officers. And her body is there, but she's gone. Check that along the present day of the proceedings. She just isn't going to listen anymore. I can go in and sit down and watch as the administrators try to see whether she understands or sentence as they try to get through to her . But I go. It's great to be a child, young and crazy wild, burning up the road with gasoline, and smash the car at a rubble. Get all the girls in trouble, you can't be arrested. Every day justice. Well, the impulse to confess to admit the truth to state your shame is so important and so basic that of course people do not need a trial to make do it. In 1980, a New Yorker named Alan Bridge said a telephone line he called the Apology Line. People call on confessed to anything. They were recorded and you could call on you could listen to other people's report about. Have it. the whole thing turned into a little community of confession. People recorded message responding to each other's apologies, Mr. Apology, Alan Bridge, we leave messages responding and sometimes you would actually contact Congress off the line. Here's some, , some footage. You're going to apologize, right? Because I broke the town hall windows. I flooded the basement. I broke the window on the back of the door of town. I could pretty bad value. Is that? Did someone say that? 16 years old, some child's class quality, due to the offer of pretty long time I say. Sorry for my resting, through public officials, making the bomb threat and death nurses. Sorry for the armed terrorist, fire bomb, and I was bomb, and they got paid me to, to some guys have, sorry for, or what I've come, a party, and a tough court of intervention. I'm sorry for the way I'm calling now I'm calling by wherever. I'm sorry for for asking the teacher in school. I feel that about it. I'd  to ask how many of these on life. What else? Sorry for the courage to rational out of people. I'm sorry. I've been paying my family. I felt so sad I had a sick, I was sick by it. So I had to...so long. The world is where we are, want to apologize. I don't know if even you were what I did with long advice, but that was an Israel. Six months before I killed six Arabs at night. Oh, yap! depending on how the Jewish settlers and the time we thought we would fight, I believe still we fight for a home that keeps the Arabs. Perhaps now that I am here, they are going realize that maybe killing not right way, or it's almost all right. Thank you. Yeah, I want to apologize to something, maybe  a human, who  a father, who request I want to apologize to them. So now my mother was led with four months. If you get too hot, you're on the roof there. And I had no job and I had no way making money. And when she was hungry at Thursday, I was making give me money. I gave her a drink. she'd be happy to be fried out for a glass of water 10 hours a day. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I can't say a private tour, I know what I do with probably more powerful thing in the world. And I know we'll be able to say a private tour and I hope I can go to the home brand and put it. Because it was the right and it's not where the shit can be. I just want to tell our friends. Thanks. I've never told anyone that's because I played my drink. I accidentally told my cousin when I was a very small child. And it's hard to be all my life, but I didn't really need it. It was, I was, I was, it was just a game to me. I was really, really, too young to be all I thought I was doing. And I was putting her head and body up from the plastic bag. So, I'm gonna work my hands right now. I just did the figure face trip, but I guess I was a lot of fun. I just mean to anything that happened. I guess it's real life. What happened? If I did this too long and I was... And she suffocated. And... I... I hid the plastic bag and I... I went out of the house, my parents went home. Never... found out they thought it was crammed out. , what's not how they did it, man. . Yeah, there's. Yeah, I've never been able to tell them I thought that I think he would hurt that work. Yeah. The nowing. And moving her. Find out that I did it. I had to wish my parents could hear it of the tape, but I guess they were well. You will have to fall in love with you alone too. I'm a little bit more annoying. All the slaves are not kind of sorry. All I love is 15, and I say I'm a little bit more stupid. Really stupid, I had a call. Okay. Okay. I mean, you... What could I have on my feet? What are you all doing? I'm not going to take my feet away. What are you doing? Don't you think it's too old to be a child? And I won't ask anything to ask. What's wrong with you? I'm not going to take my feet away. I'm going to take my feet away. I'm going to take my feet away. The apology line doesn't exist anymore. Mr. Apology, I'm a bridge. Diad and August 29th. When you did, the line was deluge with hundreds of messages from the regular college. His wife, Mary, says, is never clear of what the apology line meant to be. the years people would use to talk about all sorts of things. I think that maybe the word apology means something bigger than just saying you're sorry. Or at least maybe not the word but the line came to mean to people a place where one could go and bring their feelings. To confess not necessarily about doing something wrong, but to confess about having a feeling. When he was alive, would you ever call the line that he could come from? I mean, I call the line in the beginning when I first moved in before I moved in with him. I call the line from time to time. And you'd apologize for that. More, yeah, sometimes more to get his attention than anything else. So when forget about me, up in Washington Heights. That's living. What would you apologize for back there? What would you do, remember what you would say? Oh, they were all, , just to get his attention, things , , I'm really sorry, I was flirting with another guy or something  that. Oh, fuck. I'm such a part of the mating game. But once you actually had a real relationship, you wouldn't call the onion-y didn't film. No, but one thing that really struck me was after he died, I really turned into an apology line collar. Someone I would define as a apology line collar and the line was over. So when I really needed the line, it wasn't there. I was just completely lost. and I would have loved to have been able to call the apology line and have someone Alan on the other side, very sympathetic and understanding to help me get through it, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. So I'm a much darker person than I was before he died and I think that I understand the callers and the line much better than I even did before. He died in his own Scoob-ax and he was hit by a jet-skier who then fled the scene wasn't I'm doing what? Have you thought about the kinds of people who would call the line he used to call the line all the time? Who would do a band thing instead of people who would hurt other people and, , then flee the scene and would hurt him? Have you thought about those jet skiers in terms of that, in terms of people who used to call the line? Yes, in fact, the person that hit him would also be a prime candidate for the apology line because we think that he knew that he did something because there were witnesses that saw the accident in the... they saw someone on a jet ski, hit him, they circled around once and then took off. So, yeah. But you can imagine this, you'd actually calling the line. If they would have called the line, if the line had existed, , what would have happened? What would Mr. Apology have said if you were around the same? I think he would be pretty pissed off, but he would forgive them. I think that's how we've gone for it. Thank you for being angry with that. that he was hit. That was the total accident. But I think that if they would have apologized for hitting him, he would have been more. Because I think that forgiveness was a big part of this. Person out and he really believed in the power for forgiveness and everyone can be forgiven. I think that's something that he really grew to me. First of bridge, this is a biology. I'm confessing that I love you. Tell me do you love me too?
