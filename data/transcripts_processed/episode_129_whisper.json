Yoko. really army, which meant that for years in his job, he was dropped from the helicopter into Mediterranean, swam ashore, usually in the Lebanon, breaking to a building, rescue hostages, that was his job. And that's known when summer, it is railroads summer, army can. He was the idealized vision, manhood. I remember specifically in the Golat, which is a beautiful mountain street in the north of Israel, we were hiking. We were talking about different musicians in America. My friend said, what do you think of Billy Joel? And I'll go say, this stuff. I mean, up till that's it. I really  Billy Joel. I think I own every one of his albums. I'd probably be all the songs by heart. And literally from that second, to right now, I can't just go, three times. So soft. This is so soft. Okay? So anyway, so Jamie would ask, , twice as young, and and it would be a switch this fast. What should I do? I don't know, and I mean, and then, let's say, why would I give him your gun? Right away, I would say, he's... John wants a man. And you're playing  a child. So, did you show her a man? How will she want to? , he would say this is probably coming on a set. What you're going is telling John, ask him, am I going with you? Or am I just coming to the park? If she says, you'll just come from the police to the junk. I  you, I want to be with you. So you must be very specific. Why are you there? And why are you wanting to do that? And that is very simple. It's a transaction, just a man or woman. What do you want? What she wants? And I'm sorry. And I would just become Yoko. If I wouldn't, no. It's one thing I could say. Boy things  this. . I didn't know about this. And I was about what we just wanted. Right. But you are saying that not only would you do his voice, but he was actually giving advice that you yourself would be unable to get in. Yeah. I don't think that. The kinds of things Yoko can say, I don't think I can do. I certainly won acting  that. We didn't know Adam would give this advice. Even though he would become another person, channeled with voice and personality of his real command of James. Even though he did all of that, James stayed with Martin, he would buy it. We'd raise this question. What does it take? Who among us my friend? has not had someone who begged that for advice and we gave it to the advice. In fact, everyone will be new getting the same advice. And still they did not ask. Think of the advice that you were given in your right mind. When we did advice, we witnessed the puniness of reason. We could hear the past of human desire, emotion. We did it! Welcome to VD. this is Chicago. Public Radio International with American Life, Private Glass. Today's program most of it was recorded in front of live audiences in Seattle, Washington in Ascent, Colorado. Thanks to Public Radio Station, KU or WNC, Adel, HBO's, US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. Today on our program, it vise. Stories of people trying to give each other advice and why it vise to so rarely taken. Heck one. See for instance Seattle, right or Sarah Thow breaks a number of people who have a person And here we go. She generally tries to avoid. So yeah, so before it dies, in this case about some actu, it dies, send some thoughts on why. It will hardly ever take each other's advice. And see how those endowns savages, rice for everyone that may save lives, who it does. That tree, that demenication. Sure, I'll trick. I'm sorry, I'm not sap that is contained in our inner tree. I'm sorry. throughout the summer, music from the Black Cat Orchestra, we're with us on stage in Seattle, stay with us. That one, six in Seattle. So whatever you'd actually take the advice people give you, all of it. Surveil was nicknamed after the personal experiment which she did to exactly that. She's the other of the familiar one and she can... I'm holding a baby picture in my hand. The portrait kind from Sears. It's me and my twin sister Amy, who were maybe three dressed , she's crying. Amy's this flashing light, blonde hair, blue eyes, white tears. And I have one distinct characteristic to make me different from any baby and any other scene. Dark circles  my eyes. As if I was holding down the swing shift at the tire factory, in addition to my official duties as baby. My mother says that when I was small, she'd wake up at the middle of the night and finally playing with my toys. Once when I was 18 months old, she got up to check on me and panicked when she saw the front door swinging open. She found me outside crawling around the door. pasture dig the meat. I continue to sneak out as a sequence teenager. Most nights I go for a walk around 3 a.m., which was lovely and starlit and safe in Bozeman, Montana. Now I live in Chicago, a city which proudly just etched out New York's murder rate. Don't call us the second city. So the 3 a.m. joy walks evening. That is somewhere between certification, horizon and bets, stocks and all. That's the way my business is enjoying what Disney mountains that I vanity and I grow stronger isn't what Disney are more attractive in those mountains. été est desmin sunshine. Based on Disney conditions, it's the 31st of July that's only going to start New York and free then launch McDonald's a week of exhaustion that gets to me. So recently, I decided not. I'm not the advice to be therapy going professional, help getting time. Working under the theory that I know my problems, I'm unwilling to change. But you over throw in Somnia, I'd break my personal decorations, but I'm in an asper-help. I give it five days, I thought, a work week, I'm going to be a new way to job simple. They want the last time I took advice from my mother I was in high school. She forced me to take a typing class, arguing it might come in handy in later life, and I've never quite forgiven her for being right. But she's a bit of an insomnia for herself. I called her up and asked her suggestions on how to handle it. As I have gotten older, I've learned to drink my herbal tea. So good, herbal tea, sensible, basic, boiling of water. Maybe this advice thing isn't as scary as I thought, but moms just get me warmed up. First of all, first of all, do some real, ah, serious soul searching. Well, not. I have a policy about that word, soul. It is strictly prohibited, accepting cases of conversations having to do with Oprah recipe. Marvin Gaye. My mom doesn't have to look at these simple common sense restrictions. You're supposed to get rid of anything that might be bothering you. I'm talking about things that you need to let go of. Things that in the past that maybe have upset you or hurt you that you're still hanging on to. what I'm saying? No, we being , you mean in the new age, he sends  emotional problems. No, Sarah, I don't think you have an emotional problem. Translating, yes, Sarah, I do think you have an emotional problem. Normally, any soul searching on my part is purely accidental, and it's always brought on by a liquid other than herbal tea. So I bruised some cam of meal telling myself that, what I ? It looks a lot  Scotch. I sip three cups and search my soul for eat thoughts. I get that. So I try something else. I put on a Billy Holiday song called Why Was I For? Two minutes and 48 seconds later, I realized it perhaps I'm confusing in her specialment. fresh soul searching how do you even know if you're doing it right in how search this search I try another approach John Earl of Men's Oakwichuary was just in the paper I decided to take a personal inventory by comparing my soul with this yes what I come out on top I do the math with the occasional late payment on my college loans. Watergate. A periodic participation in obnoxious public radio pledge drives. Secret bombing of Cambodia. I can't sleep, you can't breathe. And I fall in to sleep immediately. and how you divide with the skin I've Motion cast. The depressing thing is I wake up four hours later and never get back to bed. So I crossed my answer. I'm honest. It's very long. T Bake you, doctor. I see professional help from a doctor and the University of Chicago's team disorder lab, one Wallace Mendelsign professor exactly how you divide. that's the exact 3840 different. This is a grimaces of state. Among them there are causes and some is a condition that sometimes called psychophysiological condition and some. I don't know if he's a doctor, but I can't tell you this. He's the one who helped them get to sleep. All they have to do is sit him down with the tape recorder. And ask him to say if he works about his job. Anyway, though he refuses to give me any personal advice arguing that I'm not his patient, I do manage to squeeze a few pointers out of him for someone. Maybe one of those psychos that you'll watch my problems. To that particular subject of people, one of the things that can be helpful is to try to sweep the bad and bad way of company, association, subset for sleeping and running. Love me! For boy, makes that work to a thirde. But that night I take Dr. Mendelssohn's advice and clear everything out of my bedroom. Half of which takes my bed. The other half of which just so happens to function is my office. I don't be precise now because this is science. I removed 78 books, stacked in front of the closet in the other room. I transport 15 pins to turn table to transfer radio to take a quarter and 23 megs. I take away dozens of scraps of paper, some of which were hand-leaf stored on in the bed itself. I unplug the computer and the fax machine and lug them out. I'm clearing away all this dusty stuff. and I get into bed in the hoot because the stacks of books are blocking closet right keep my pajamas and I think about what a mess the living room is and I'm going to have to have to hollow that crap back in here tomorrow. And I never get more than about 30 minutes straight up so somewhere in there I'm headed to have a dream in which my bedroom because I got robbed. Day 3, we interned. Doctors and mothers and friends sold fashion so 20th century. If I wanted a Tommy F. brief future, I must look to the future, to the world wide web. I promise is so much. I do a search on it, Tommy. The first thing I find is sponsored by the National Institute of Health. It has its three main classes. with Swami at our old age, depression and female gender. Wow, no wonder I can't solve my little problem. Then I log onto something called the Virtual Hospital and www.vh.org. In the insomnia advice. section, one of its suggestions is, don't engage in stimulating activity for bed. Examples include playing a competitive game of cards, or watching an exciting program on television. I decided to take this advice and avoid exciting programs on television, which means one thing turned on the tonight show. J. Leno's monologue features an event humor of that pair of lines in Biagra and Linda Tripp, a hilarious get called Presidential Jeopardy, pits A-Link and George Washington against President Clinton whose scores big and eat moors' waitresses category. Then one of those animal guise comes out with a tiger. The conversation goes  this. J. Leno, these must be pretty indangible. Animal Guide. Yeah, they are. I'm asleep before the musical guest comes out. This advice is working the best so far. I stay asleep for five whole hours. Is everyone know about this? That may be this is the reason Leno's ratings are better than letterments. Day four. A day without caffeine. is  sure I can come up with a good analogy but it's too tired. Consensus should I say conspiracy. Every last one of my sources, my mom, my friend, the doctor, the web, advises against caffeine. She's a problem in that I've been to the coffee since I was 15. I know laundry very early as much as I used to but still, my motto, C-N-A-Pope-B-A-E-H-O-S-U without coffee. I'm nothing. So today I'm planning on nothing. I go cold to start with a brisk pot of pepper hit T at 830. By 1015 I'm sprayed on the couch with a cardigan sweater wrapped around my eyes. I'm not going to do anything. My head drops. Phone rings every 15 minutes. What are the calls from a telemarketer to some from a quick cry? At 1238, I crawl over to the cabinet where I keep the coffee can and sniff its content. It is very long then. And guess what? It doesn't work. You got it. What about it? It's a game. I'm up all night watching the clock waiting for you. You got it. morning when I can make coffee. At 5am I told my son, I've been sitting down six cups before 5.15. Now that reason is restored, I come to this. There's anything worse than in song and I'm speaking to my special song. being up in the middle of the night is kind of my satisfaction. It's quiet, dark, phone doesn't ring. You can listen to records and hear their movies around TV. I've never known another life, now I'm not so sure I want to. One of my early memories is listening to my dad, the middle of the night. He's hoping he closing his happy, scary, by carpeted of soda into his glass. I was awake with a great 해주 mouse. in the middle of the night lying in bed, he invents his feet. I don't pretend to understand. I'm working on a spoke discol� case in the morning. It's really cool. I drew a picture this morning when I woke up. You just feel sorry for those people. It's slap all night and didn't accomplish anything. We are flawed creatures, all of us. Some of us think that we should fix our flaws. To get rid of my flaws, and there be no one left. By looking at Mary some day, Song of Dark Service, and my eyes probably better. I just finished  me. Thank you. See you again. Coming up, easy advice, we can be serious, serious advice, be greasy, really easy to have a difference. The American light, my regards to E2, but I've put in the course which is E and the variety of writers and the box. It is a tackle that being based put in rice. So, I would put it in kind of five audiences and ask him in Seattle. We conducted ec 2. program, actu, rise, consent, there are the times that people give each other a rise and then there are the times people actually take it and they are very good. Let's now sort out one of the other, let's read the song, let's read the sweet song, let's read the sweet, let's read the sweet, let's read the sweet. I'll help you to return to someone who's next to him, don't say. Someone who is the better. your entire life to solve another piece of problems. Bye-bye. Let's see if she can still be. Ah! Suddenly I'm thinking. She can't hear me. My mom is actually a couple of psychologists, publishers, researchers, and writers. So recently did vice-com, she tells the business. Well, I had a patient and I love Susan Poverty. You said this is a video about this. Right. This patient wants to just make a mess  her body. Every time. That's possible. Let's do a role we've got. I'll be using this as a form. And so I can send proper patient to patients. Patients in the world can tell exactly to ship your own. And then light. go on and she says, well I know what I should do but obviously I'm having a problem with doing what is it? What's that trouble taking advice? No classes there, no classes. They can actually take it as a reason for us to get it. There's nothing that's great to spend the day out giving advice. and some researchers' queries that people who give advice feel to a refugee. People who receive the advice particularly when it's unsolicited, feel to her or home. So what we've learned from the researchers that advice is not to be a refugee advice gift and it's not to be a advice we seek. Either way, given the advice has nothing to do with whether or not they would be a nice person. This. this garden right with us. And, who's the advice provided by our nation's burgeoning advice industry, which could stare at this self-help book's advice house using this. So, a preparation for today's show, I talked to Dan and said, which advice house is very curious. And, this is the afternoon person. It's about when we talk on tape music, he expressed this cheer for the end of his chosen profession. Dan, when you write how do you think we'll take the advice? not usually no. But most of the time I don't think people take advice from anybody. People seek advice to sort of sell out all the possibilities all their possible choices. And then very often just do what they would have done to begin with without asking for advice. Well I think those are the things they don't take for instance. They would take anyone's advice. Well people don't think advice why people suffer, we will get advice. because it's well. Advice pound dances are not not not that giving advice. And when you think about one person sent in a question, the columns be derived by millions of other people who didn't ask questions, who are not suspicious, don't have that problem. Why are those millions of other people reading? Shodden Florida or the reading from pleasure, because other people's problems are entertaining. So reading to be titulated, and if you write a good advice column, you do do all this. So in only, it's not a wrap, it looks  one of the advice column action dots, which is not really advice. Then, after say, it's another line of things. I asked, is that when it comes up, is it right to the device for something? Yeah. Is that when it comes to the fun? No. Okay. Why does it quote actual experts? Oh, it is not. time it will act in the best. It will become the appearance of the best. I pretend to write advice to all of this, and I do not. There are times when I can write my advice to all of this. I will also tell me this one incredibly bad way about the advice of all of this. About the get is the sending as per the text. Then you will give advice to all of this secrets. of the genre is the letter will include the advice that ultimately you get. The letter will say, here's my problem, and I don't know what to do. This is what I think I should do. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. And so you have to cut that paragraph. Otherwise, it's going to repeat. There's very often the person those exactly do have to earn their kid in the box, and they do. And how often does that happen? They actually include reanswering blood. 25% of the time. But there's another category in class. Take good and end little. Text on. In the last year, on two different occasions, I printed my father to ask for advice. And these are two of the first times that I've actually turned to him for directed advice. Really? It's just... So, the person these times, I asked for advice about whether or not you buy a recent one. And the second time I needed advice, setting up a 401. And my dad's a business person count, these people advice that the saw day are. And each time he sent me this desk, he sent me this recent question, he sent me some numbers, and then he told me what to do. And I did it. And each time this is very real. intimacy. they were intimate. Family say you use a real intimacy to be your advice. Actually happens to something about putting your fate in someone else's hands and saying, you need help and you need help. Oh, you're right. You. And it was that you were going to provide some opportunity to have an individual emotional lunch. Your Zordships. You had it affected your emotional life. In a real way. Yeah. And that that's. kind of was moving better and it's with very male very heterominal. They really treat me. If I could probably have had certain guffet to a pond over that he's not going to do with feelings, just numbers. Yeah, but I think it points the power of what the device is. You kind of just had it with the spank. It could be that. It's true. So the this whole idea of the entity, the first percent, , that you would actually turn to somebody and say, don't come with you, do you? How come? The entity that is so powerful, that I feel  in a way, the difference between that act and what happens in vice-common, is the same thing as the difference between having sex with somebody and private, and what happens in  corner? I think that's absolutely true. I mean, vice-common is a public performance of it. right back. And just as appearing in Pornos, you try to suffer about the person appearing in it. But  if you're the kind of person who appears to be the person who tells people things about you. That. I think also being the kind of person who seeks advice out to public format, tells listener something about you. Good or bad. I mean, I certainly would have to deduct a多少. I would have to keep hiding secrets. Who would you call me? One added in advice to all of us in public form, which that exists. After the advice comes, savage love and book my business. Usually it goes  this. You're watching some drunk in a bar screaming his tank. Space is red, he's standing, she's sitting. It's on me. And you look. You can't help him. And suddenly, he sees you seeing him. And then he asks, what are you looking at? You can be through another country. You can be a very young child and still. The first time you're asked this question,  it's a trick. What are you looking at? It's a baboon thing to do really, a wafer and insecure monkey to reassure himself that he's the ultimate. He's challenging you, smaller and weaker monkey, to see if you have the guts to tell him, bigger and drunker monkey. The truth. You're looking at a jerk. Deep down he knows he's a jerk, and now he knows you. He was attracting attention. do himself acting  a jerk, that's what you were looking at. What are you looking at? Can have an added element of terror and times for data? Because sometimes we look at guys who aren't acting  baboons. Sometimes we just look. And sometimes the guy who might not want to be looked at, look at just looking. In these circumstances, what are you looking at? Usually equals I saw what you were looking at. Instead of him knowing  he's a jerk,  he knows you're a fat. And you blame yourself, of course, vestigial shame. You've got sloppy checking out some street guys, but then you've got caught. It's not even the looking so much that gives us a way, but the nervousness, this fear of getting caught. That makes our looks different. Distinguished. from the looks that Straitman gave each other. Of course, not all Straitman might be looked at by gay men. Some find our turn. Slatter. Hipsters. Cornstars. Public radio personalities. But violence so often follows this kind of what Except Me140 sung by drink of alcohol in the dark. But even when it doesn't, you still get the adrenaline shot, and the adrenaline, and the adrenaline flashbacks. It's  conditioned response. I expect that Matthew Shuffard was asked what he was doing. That's by the two straight guards. The beating down. Now, in some places, we can safely assume all the ground. And pull clamps. Man, Hatton. Ikea. You can look just as much and just as obviously as you . But in most places, self preservation requires you to assume that all the guys are spring. High school, Wyoming. Sears? If you're going to check the guys out at Sears, you need to look straight yourself and you need to look  you ain't looking. One of the ways gay men spot each other is by waiting for the glance. The look looks... The straight guy at Sears wants to look at you. They'll just turn in face, no nerves, no side long glances. Just looks. But a gay guy who wants to look at a guy in the series who he thinks might be gay, but isn't sure about since he's a serious. He won't turn. He keeps his head straight as he passes his eyeballs, however. Follow you as you walk by moving into their far quarters. But he doesn't turn his head. If you're gay, you do the same. Your eyeballs follow his, but you keep looking straight ahead as you pass. Action! This is a complicated time amp and I'd  to demonstrate. I have a volunteer from the audience. Bring up the lights for a second. This theater seats about 1600, and according to the actual aerial tables for a public radio crowd, this size, there should be one straight man. Watch all these important TWIN hats! Very good! your hands? Oh how lucky for us is in the front row. Why don't you come right up here? See you tomorrow. See you guys in the front row. Come on, the shows. Okay, we're going to do this look. This is gonna be very special. What's your name? Do you pledge to public radio? Do you do now? Can I have your credit card? We'll just return it up. Go stand right there. Turn around. No show them you're bummed up here. Okay. Street guys are always so quick to show you there. , it's the great-for-bit, straight guys zone. And what's the opportunity to present itself? , I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. No look at him. We're at Sears. We're gonna walk past each other. We're both gay. Let's pretend. We're walking past another eyes meet. Right? Our heads don't turn our eyes meet our eyes meet our eyes meet our eyes meet our eyes meet our eyes meet our eyes meet. We get past each other eyes hurt, ice-strain, ice-strain, and then we turn in love. Only after passing each other . Do you turn in love? All gay man students. We do. it all the time. If the guy you're walking by doesn't lock eyes and doesn't turn, once you pass him,  he's not dead. If the guy looks, once you've passed him, it means he's gay, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he's gay. He could just be checking to see if you're checking him. You might be doing the same, checking to see if he's checking you out. Well, you're not in tune, which means that you both be looking, but I review are actually in tune. Now imagine doing this every day, every pass you may... rest of your life, whether you're interested in him or not. Ice train is basically 80% the gay lifestyle. Now checking out a guy you're pretty sure is straight is a lot riskier. Some straight men though. You got him too pretty. Ask him. Screw. But I recently discovered something that allows me to check out straight guys. with our wrist, without fear, and it works every time. I operate here today, it's public service. I am an advice columnist as my regular readers know. I'm interested in just one thing. Help me, help me. Ah! And this is advice that could help save lives. Game and carry this thing wherever you go, and guys will assume you're straight always. You could be in a supermarket wearing a dress and claws. Building your grocery cart with butter flavored Chrisco. But if you've got this thing with you, if you've got this thing with you, you are straight. I speak of course of the human being. Hi, boy, Brent Terry. We'll walk out on stage now and strap a baby backpack to the Brent with a baby too. I'm not going to do that. You'll scare the problem. He can't see you. My boyfriend and I adopted a baby about 11 months ago. This is not my baby. I would not exploit my baby. This is a neck. This baby. has a sack, hard, made more money this year than you. Now, after we adopted the baby, I don't remember when I realized that the baby, in addition to being the best thing that ever happened to us, Apple of our eyes, also functions as a get out of baby-shing fruit pot. And I realized it soon after we brought it home. I realized it soon. piggy, big stuff  that. I paused to check out the guys, the ways, no, no, no, you turned. I'll be looking for one. Just play. Just fun. He wasn't dead. He had a girl hanging out of there. He was read me to Bear in his heart. And he didn't give me a nervous glance. You just looked. I didn't know what to mean. He can't smile. Is he? Why so soon? Beer, red meat, well-drust? No. Not my such. That it hit you. You assume? That is straight. You. And these smiles. He thought we met straight land somewhere at school or at work. And he couldn't remember where he knew me from, but to be on the safe side. And so it. not to offend the smile. Not. Hey, how you doing? He said, instead of what are you looking at? Hey, how you doing is never to turn the question. It's a great guy. Somebody people have a simple, but they're hands over my mouth. I don't understand. Small children. Hey, how you doing is never to turn the question. question, it's straight guy code for you on one. The next time I was at the supermarket, the baby, you happen again. Looked.com.smile then. Pretty soon, I was sneak in pizza before. I was checking out straight guys, up to street, airports, grass frogs. So look, as I have, maybe on my back. I could look at straight guys this boldly, as any straight guy would look at a straight guy. I suffer no more ice-strain and it's all hey how you do it and never what are you looking at I mean Strater now than when I first walked out to I will now put on a piece Even the peak kick. Don't I look straight? I quickly progressed from checking out straight guys, learning with straightness. It became a game. They assumed I was straight because I had this baby, this monstrous rock almost speaking baby. I was great because I have this baby. Okay, how far did I take? How gay could I have? Still keep on straight. Can I ask you what? Did I call you? Can I compliment you? Could I work the original cast recording Steven Soundheim to Little Night Music in the Conversation? And still be Bob straight? Yes. Yes. I honestly, when I went to baby, the only people I got, what did you look now? Not at all. Another game then. Sometimes I'll see a cute little fact boy. I forgot the baby is on my back, given the walk past. Look, look,  the straight guys, the supermarket, the game then I'm saying the seat is straight. And if they catch me, look at this, they are the classmate. The most acceptable part varied. kids out cruising for sex with baby. But take my seat. You want to pass? Get a baby. It works. And we live near apart. Me and my boyfriend start using baby. And a couple of high school soccer teams practice playing games. But before the baby came up. I would stop and steer. But now they sit in the sea. Baby, aren't I bad? And I want to quit. The baby babbles, the sunsets, the other dads. Some of them got to be hot. Turns? This man, hot. I want to quit. Yeah, it's my dad. Hey! What's that? How you doing? Dance savage! My cat orchestra. Okay, I have many questions. Send us all out of here with your moment of reflection. There's eyes, side, and that's what we want. Is what I'm doing. We all here tonight live on Planet Earth. Now let's unpack. And when we move the letter H off the end of that planet Earth, put it back in the top where it belongs. Let's go! But, let me ask you this, on the solar map, who are earth's pit neighbors? My Zenfinen, what is that, tell us? That we've got war on one side and on the other side alone. Do you see, we actually want to move away some more. It's not to it. Now, so, it doesn't seem to see it that way. Now saw, I think Mars is the next big thing. But why should I be? Let me tell you something, now saw is run by a bunch of meaty ears. Tonight, I'd  you to join me. Next is eyes designed to help us release these terror or tomorrow hostilities created by the meaty ears. Rather, body, the virtues. of Venus, laverive laverive lavera.
