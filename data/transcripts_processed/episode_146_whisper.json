From Brooklyn on the left from the streets of Brooklyn that was born probably the guard. This is from this great documentary. by Mark Lewis called Zimbline of rats. And I know what an entirely is. It's a street mentality is I know what a... I know when somebody takes on that type of a role. And when I look into the eyes of rats, I can see that they have an intelligence just  in the street. Whereas that is one kid, you're facing up to the twinkest. They don't have a single minded presence of mine to do what they have to do to you. You're doing it. You're doing it. You're doing it. Usually. Let me talk. about man versus nature and the build these urban environments and the coash nature and the foam nature. There's a part of us that believes that we should be rooting for nature, that nature needs beautiful greenery and the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea. But when we'd straight through a perfectly paved sidewalk, when the cockroaches march in and the rat arrives, we remember why we wanted to tame nature in the first place. Brad showed up at this guy's house and he tried sealing walls and he tried poisoning them. chasing them and killing them with a two-byte war, and still they can. And multiply. Terrorizing his family, finally forcing them to move. I really do believe that they knew that they won. It's really one year when you do look inside of his eyes, , you can see him car so he's got something inside. And he's looking right back at you. He wants you just as big as you want him. For me this, it's you or him. I know when I was there I wish that that's dead. And if I could, if I were to kill each one by hand myself. I'm going to be a person who wrote my family, Tara Haw, economic grief. So, yeah, they definitely hold the brothers. They've scored and they've scored my family. And we'll always be with them. Well today in our program, five stories of nature is Seeping into man-made environments, stripping the veneer of civilization off of us in the process. Back one, interpretation of dreams, in which we hear how an entire nation is cooked with the sheer trauma of what it means to knock down trees, rip into the earth, and all the other things you have to do to nature, when you go to modern industrial city, back to one brave man stands up for what's right, in which one of America's best known politicians goes mono-amano on behalf of human beings against the untamed wilderness, factory, church of Latter-day snakes. It's that parier tells the true story of one family experiment at bringing the outdoors indoors. Backboard, got blessed to hamster who has his own, in which an average high school student explains why it is bad luck for any animal to become her pet. Back five, waiting to the end of the world, the writer Iggy Scam hits the road, it has the theory about the men who fish, maybe you've seen these guys, right in the middle of the big city, stay with us. Back one. patient of dreams. Looting everything that we think of as modern life, cities and suburbs both means trampling nature. And that bothers me people. They want to keep nature at hand, even if they're living in the heart of the city. Even if the part of nature that trying to preserve, something most of us can't see, never notice. David Rackoff is this place. Grashton, literally gray rock, is a famous boulder in Reykjavik Ice Cream. It sits cracked into that unsatisfied on its own. were of saw. On two occasions in the last 30 years, plans were under wait to expand the road and detonate the road. Both times, locals came forward and protested with destruction, claiming that the rockers inhabited by hidden people. In visible beings, one other dimension who, along with elves and foils, are a mainstay by scientific rocker. And both times, despite a complete lack of concrete evidence, indeed, despite a complete lack of even a history tales attached to that rock. Yes, scientific pup. of the Grotesic Administration needed these protests in spare time. Prior to my arrival, Victor Engelsen, chief of the publishing unit for the Public Grotesic Administration, there, the R-G-I, had sent me an article here written that explained the decision. It is titled, Public Grotesic Administration and the Blue House. It turns out to be quite beautiful written, in addition to this day job. Victor is a novelist, is third book he's been on the National Best Solarist for months, but its tones and interesting mixture of exasperation and respect for the freedom's rockers. He writes, a lot of time goes in for answering the Sunni or the Earth's feet. It is hope that this text will rectify the situation, and it can be looked upon as the office interpretation of the Clara as you are measured. It will not answer the question of whether the Clara's own powers do or do not believe in else some hidden people because of opinion, this is... and it tends to be a rather personal map. However, you may assume that you also severely doubt the existence of some of them. In person, as you may suppose. These disbelief in these giving people is primarily a point-poke tradition, not really believe, by many people. Yeah, that's right, that's right. And then I want to wipe you guys, make you. Any conversations Yeah, cost people who do believe  they are pretty serious It's really we have people who believe in a lot of things that nobody else believes in in The larger community we would never even think but this is a small competition So  basically everyone knows everyone more almost so you really have to listen to everyone That's it You need me a party of the line. , when you scream at someone in the chat, you need a few million, you can't even get scared. So you do it. But not. Not so much here, I'll be there. I heard stories, I've tried, yes. But I thought they'd be people to the city, or any guarantee in every country. and the apologies for the head of the ethnological department of the National Museum. He is a sweet-looking, legal, broad-grandfather of the time. A man in his circles who,  Victor, also said he whisked the regrat to the pretext to get someone my community on to an airplane and overchised. His disgroupness is definitely essentially none of the scientific aspects that are society. Imagine your acts are in jazz. He plays devoted to a quintessential American art. And we're reported. my mother came to pick up and my girlfriend and said, please me on why so many times. Now when you were a child, did you believe in them? I didn't believe in them, but I didn't actually believe it. It was in my own form that they were too close. There was said that they lived from the people there. And the music. the kras, near the year. It's before it belongs to the hippy people. Those various stories. This turns out to be a paradigm that I hear over and over again. The story of the grass belonging to the hippy people that we've seen in the deep cloud. The other model of story that keeps coming up is one of the Nebulent Wishful Films. Mortal women fall into slum This makes this very stupid. I cannot be woke in this dream state. They are visited by human people and having performed some service or having been following love with these mortal women or diseases if they find a car. Much fine with them and they are wearing two cars. They were the city people's shop, they were the living rooms. They are  human beings, but they are... and they are more blue-dewing. They were the best houses in the homes... The kids, they have back the furniture, they have back the clothes, they have back the food. Friedsteeria of Dreams is ultimately that they are at heart, disguised versions of unacceptable wishes, of infantile desires whose fulfillment is necessarily unhealthy on time. In the country is physically influenced. It's cold, seemingly endless winter with on five hours of smudging. Things as basic as you want, clothing, sufficient food and companionship might all be seen as a perfect breakfast. But it still begs the question, but possible purpose to these stories of today. Present day regular is a completely modern city, essentially, the new into the nasty brutish adventure. Still the stories that happened. my parents' grandma time, I found they remembered and closely garq, couldn't they everyone at all? When I was about ten years old, I saw an elf. Damn, in my house. Let me interrupt your engine to picture. This is not some sad hat-welling yoke and hoffy-t-this woman works in a trendy clothing store on lagged at gura. Very cute, it's main shopysuit. She is wearing a long black skirt, a shiny dark bed top, a glittery-moa and black онites this. Is one Which What do you ? Yeah, I  you see the drawings of them. Small Little hat Do you believe them? Yes of course Really? Yes, yes No, I don't think so There are so many stories and people talk a lot about themselves I think it's nice to be linked That's one thing that I  about us It is that yearning quality, that sense that it's at least nice to believe in hidden people that comes up again in the game, even from the skeptical icons. The tales are a vestige of a pre-urban icing. They are hold up from what came before. And the physical record of what came before seems to be disappointed in alarmingly to them. Everywhere I look at there is a construction, and the city itself, despite being over 200 years old. to the country. I had been expecting baby Amsterdam all Spanish living within your new heart inspired, gable to publicize. Break it into a book turns out to be a very bowhouse created to them. A lot of it looks not a little  a vast and a view of the shins. Urbanization is intrinsically a violent process. During a church during a party itself. and perhaps a little bit of guilt. It makes us want to hold fast in what is the earlier described. This was a part of the R.C. laughed in a bit of an instant that it's concentration on handwork on non-dustial. And part of it's what made the brothers been decided to compile their all at the order of the indigenous journey from tells when they did. Even Martha Steeze, monomonagre of Session with the homemade is born to see more impulse. And then possibly it not stop. Please slow down. We are here in the library now. We know about five of these initiatives about safety, conspiracies and this and else, he will be able to show them anything, student research that we, as you can do. This is Magnus Gandhi, founder of the L School, which offers four hour courses. The course includes a busker of the main elephant who didn't hate the sightseeing of the vehicle followed by a typical Icelandic coffee and hand. It's all pleasantly low-wrapped, the sign on the door is paper fly, the broad cartoon goes. Within that demographic of those who learn from hidden people to exist, Magnus 16s but he covers this year on the vinegar of sight. He calls for sightseeing. He is convinced. that with properly funded scientific research, the existence of hidden people could be proven in conclusive way. Magnus speaks about hidden people as an anthropologist or census tech. The main population of hidden people who tell us numbers in 20 to 30 times a week. This is long to see them especially especially. I would be wanted to see them and be invited to their chief because I would ask 5,000 postures in this sense there. Which can you put on properly for actively changing action yourself? I'm still going to get this on there. Are you going to go out there, Mrs? That's probably the reason why they haven't been there. It clearly rankles in a little bit that airlast of us, or can't have to turn one of Iceland's most noted else communicators. Kind she has been seeing else in hidden people her whole life. Magnus has led me to believe that my chances of meeting Ela would be slim to that, which is difficult to achieve. nothing helpful that she crafted in up to her ripe trees. But when I call without having to push, she tells me to come to the next step. Airlie's maps of hidden people south around Iceland are on sale in tourist shops in right here. I was expecting a Stevie next time. Wild hair, clanking jewelry, chatter and malayan velvet tits. Instead, I found a friend leave somewhat shy woman in her fort. living in a lovely apartment on the top for a variety of townhouse with a baywindor. Airless House is decorated in the tasteful middle-class aesthetic for my expected opinion. Landscape, old furniture, Airless Friend, York, and our so-toe is there to help that. Things between you and off. When did you first see or realize that you could see hidden? And I assume she is the best student to ask the way I see. Alice is always there with the super-areest beings who live in dimensions other than our Earth. that one right there, she says, indicating a place on the coffee table beside a Danish modern glass astronaut. She then catches herself. Oh, that's her. She shakes her head slightly, news that her forgetfulness that others do not possess her gift. Who cares? It's a somewhat disingenuous moment,  when your friend newly backed his Western Parisist youth, it's , , it's perfect. How you say, from us? When they are playing the rhythm, they can sing. Yeah, everyone, they use the craft them, someone sees playing, they can't get around. Are they moving? I'm sitting around right here. I'm sitting here. So you're walking over here, I'm sitting here. I'm sitting here. So you're walking over here, I'm sitting here. I'm suddenly over kind of completely inappropriate urge. The barely suppressed impulse, this slammer hand down in the conflict, I don't really feel right where she's going. Obviously, I've never felt in this. She's completely in person. She's serving every home. There's a war war on earth who's  the size of a three-year-old child, every home has it and the both beings you can't communicate. The greenhouse is a house. The near city too. And do they? Yeah, no. Yeah, no. But your points out that house cells are a privilege, not a lie. For the energy of a given house gets to negative, she says, and there is drinking the fight, the ultimate lead. Suddenly, mysticism,  philosophy, recovery, speed, and else are considered as one. Airlesses that Elzer manifestation nature inherently good without the new chunk on our own police. There is almost no more urban point of view in the nature than this past vote in the party. Human kind of that nature grew as in. thinking of finding that El Zimflah is good. But it's a false.com. After all, following this logic, system chapled that the full of elements is good. The next day on my way to capital of it airport, I get a system located the landscape outside the city. In the week after noon light, it isn't unreleased at a moderate. flat, vaguely undulating black rock, crack all over the tracer of visions. To the right, the vast grey suit into the left and the distance disfanged hills, looking with whales, resting on their side to each one base, and against the horizon. At one point we drive within half a mile of the perfect current, young walk here, the rain falls all the way. In a mid-tummer spring, Shakespeare described. the Athenian wood that lies just beyond the gates of the city as a place where the wild time, where oxips in the nodding by the crowds. Allight over ten feet, lush woodbomb, the sweet must roses and fragrant hunts. It's proud to be a map of Indian parts. You can't take two steps without having to push us into blossom-hidden branch considering the kelp is much of a fairytale. By contrast, Icelanders were frequently all alone in these. This space is when open wide and disconnected and it is our nature to create for ourselves and see formed human analysis. The hard life for it is over on the sense. The power side and the fine friends and rolling tough grants from having to work for the work to have it. And as imagination bodies for the form of things I know, the power's pen turns into shapes and it is very much. We're hungry and we are hungry. Yao are there. Usually the tea car is located un Pronounceingerbar, These are current work. That's why. You're doing it. You're doing it. That too. Okay, so that's what we do. In Iceland, government moves massive boulders because they hand-forced citizens that invisible, hidden people with near those boulders. As we look around the world, not every city government is quite as accommodating. People's videos and product issues. Take this, it's in. This is really. Giuliani back again on the air now we're gonna go we're gonna go to David in Ossing sir. Hello, I'm Giuliani. Hi David. Let me just listen to us again. David, good heart executive president of the York Courage right next to us. Last week when we spoke you were very discharging department that I should get a life. That was very unprofessional. We're trying to get something very fleet done without you talking over me we're trying to get They're on my show, I have the right to talk all the way. But here's the thing. And on the back there's left, I'm... Okay, this is stop to you right there. They're on my show, and so I guess I have the right to talk. Then... This is the Mayor of New York course. This was a footage July 23, 1999, who was doing his week with Colin Show, and that he'd be EBCA. This exchange made the news because the Mayor got so extra signs that whether New York is should be allowed to be parents. in their homes. Mr. Giuliani of course is famous for having transformed New York City, seeking everything including homeless block streets. In his view, New York versus Faradst, it's just a reiteration, basic question, civilization versus chaos. And he knows where he stands. If you follow the news, very, very closely, you may have read about this. And you can't read it. Very few of us actually heard it. We said, we're happy. You're on my show, I have the right to talk all these. But here's the thing. And the fact is, I'm, and the fact is, and the fact is, and the fact is, and David, important issue taking care of where the city is violating state law. And I, David, you last week, if you care about the law. Yes, I do care about the law. I think you have a totally and absolutely misinterpreted the law because there's something to range about you. No, there's a certain thing. You, David, the excessive, the one concerned that you have for ferrets is something you. you should examine with a therapist. Understand it well. Now with me. How insulting me again. I'm not insulting me and honest with you. Maybe nobody in your life has ever been honest with you. But this is excessive. You're being forcing me. You. David. There is something. There is a serious. There is going on. David. Just conversation is over. David. Thank you. There is something really, really, very sad about you. You need help. You need somebody to help you. It's excessive. concern with little weasels is a sickness. I'm sorry, that's my opinion. You don't have to accept it. There are probably very few people that would be at the honest with you about that that you should go consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist and have him help you with their successive concern how you are devoting your life to weasels. There are people in this city and in this world that need a lot of help. There's something that's done wrong you're compulsion about it. You're excessive concern. with it is just sign of something wrong in your person and out. I do not mean to be insulting. I'm trying to be honest with you and I'm trying to give you advice for your own good. You have a sickness and I know it's hard for you to accept that because you hang on to the sickness and it's your shield, it's your whatever. you gotta go to somebody who understands this a lot better than I do and I know you're real angry at me but actually you're angry yourself and what you're afraid of what I'm raising. , you need help and please get it. Now we're going to move on to Richard in the Bronx. Hello? Yes, Richard. Yes. Mr. Mayor. My name is Richard. Richard. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. So we got him Clinton, going that first stance and very issue. I'm just happy to never return him off. Coming up, story involving Scott Paryr, since closest and newspaper reporter or a bunch of kids and a rattlesnake, also Hannah Hamster come back from the grave, continue another urgent yet greasy unanswered questions. Follow heruls, please R Let's have awesome music Just  you saw us. And we'll meet soon This is why we came to an end of the spells with Michっていう and this program is about this practice and prepses when nature in the same way itself. You can find this in the complete man-made. And what that does? We've adapted a three-var program, a three-church of the latter-day snakes. This is the story of people who want more of nature in chance to occasionally hike and do some on that side. These people who bump up against the question, how far should we go and above the data from us? And we bring it in the sun in the house. Let's get carried out to the same. We had already brought home the dynamite blasted caps, we found the bandit in the gullybite three way. Now we prepared to set out the put hills, captured a rattlesnake. Our father did not let us keep the explosives and I doubted he would allow rattlesnake in the house. But my brother, my older brother, had seen the snake and knew where it did and he wanted it. He needed it to study for science. He'd read a book on her pathology and it made a snake catching stick. by carving a small fork of one end to pin down the snakes head against the ground. We practice with this thing. My brother, myself, my best friend, when Tabby and imaginary snakes came back young. We had a pocket bag, shark got her wet still. He used the cut open boon and suck out the poison in the case of one of his cut-babe. We felt pretty sure what we were doing. My brother said, look, keep. bit in the cage in my room downstairs and feed it mice and toes, as long as we keep it a secret, everything will be part. He said this looking at me because the dynamite blasting caps had also been a secret, tied to the whole story when night had dinner. How we found the wooden crates and the coppins along the river, how we recognized the contents because in those days, there were public service commercials on television during the cartoons. Morning kids never to touch blasting caps that might be lying around this scarred. on forgot. Kids at that, kids at have their arms blown off, their faces were red and so are. So when we found the box, it was  finding very treasure. We weren't going to touch the curtains, but we weren't going to leave them there either. We were careful, very careful carrying them home, walking slowly, smoothly, one-pull step, and it would be all she wrote, so they blew. Say , I guess I wrong, if you've been happy for three months, since we're all old, sorry, now I guess I wrong, who's been asked to say goodbye. We brought the boxes home and hidden them in the basement where they'd be saved, thinking that there would be endless possibilities. I told the story at dinner hoping that our dad would recognize these possibilities, but immediately we called the cops and they came and took it all away. Then the next day, the reporter showed up and we were in the paper and it just didn't come out at all  I thought of. I admitted it was mistake to talk about the dynamite. I said I'd learn my lesson and I swore I would not say anything ever about the ravasite. He sweared a God, but when he said, there is no God, but when he said, swearing on. I swear to God, I swear on my own, I can keep a secret. But we all knew that I could. I was the type of kid who tried to wrap the truth tightly inside my body, only to have an eventual emergency might now. a hairy moth and a cacone. We headed out with our nap sacks. Let's be able to down the street of our brand new subdivision from the far eastern edge of the town. Next to the puttons of the Los Ashmounds, the place of natural forces, the line with civilization ended and the wilderness began. Some of the homes in the subdivision were newly occupied and some of the stolen construction. With miles of scrap wood in the yards, the asphalt glass would be the sidewalks and driveways wide and shine floating six inches above the native sand gravel Waiting for street first, top so and soft Because through a neighbor's backyard, jumped at fence, you're in crowd through a three foot diameter drainage pipe underneath a tree wet armman Moving around at the city, walking up into the scrub brush We didn't know it there, but the entire city was still... surrounded by rattlesnames. The Salt Lake Valley is shaped  full 20 miles in diameter, but the Salt Lake itself resting  a bull's mercury at the bottom and the peaks of the mountains forming the rim, 7,000 feet above. The rattlesnames live at a particular narrow band of elevation on the inside of this bull and their habitat of niche is continuous around the hunt for  a poisonous bell that was being inserted. and strictly the city of Saint. As if the battle for the gardener, Hidden, or Stilar, both, which I know the moment for me, maybe the snakes to this well. But all we knew did was that my brother had seen one rattlesnake and knew where it was in a crack and now grab a box. Walking up to the rock out, when you're telling us how it's cousin, Mar гор, the top! in that some scientists from the University of Utah had impracted radio-active pellets in the stomachs of some rattlesnakes and then released them in the footclips only to discover the months later down by the Great Salt Lake. That's 15 miles, brother said, rattlesnakes don't migrate, how would they get bit by sliding along the streets? They get run over by cars. That's just it, right, say. The scientists couldn't figure it out neither until a woman was taking her. the weak and the toilet got bit to the butt and died. That's when the scientists realized the snakes were in the sewers. That's ridiculous, rather said. Rattles snakes don't  water. They don't swim the sewers. They  to stay in one place and sit in the sun. They say, well, that's what the scientists said. It's not true, right, but you don't know that much. I'm saying, you may have read a book, but you're not a scientist. Yeah, it works. Well, for this, I know enough to know your cousin's lying to you. When we got close to the rock-out truck, we got down on our hands and knees, crawled to the position where we could look down and see the rattlesnip, right when my brother had said it. Lying in the surf, just outside an awfully crack. It was a little rousey, maybe only two people. My brother took the stick and slowly he and she was way around right and just underneath it. And then he jumped up and jabbed him. He missed and the snake lunged it. He jumped back and fell over and then he got out the jab again. This time, pinning down the snake's tail. The world has lunged the bite his hand. My brother jumped back again. Releasing his whole bloody and eye runner feet yelling. Get it, get it, get it. But the snake was quick and slip back into the crackout reach. The whole thing. took maybe five seconds, but I've never seen anything  it. We were jumping up and down, jumping nearly out of our bodies, while we sing, they sang. We waited for this snake to come back out of the craft, but we scared it, we'd die, and then money and I couldn't be quiet, even though my brother kept pounds to shut he was mad, and even more upset with himself or miss a miss chin. My brother had a band with a spear, a death of a least severe injury, in a way we'd seen in movies and read about books, but a never experienced push-in. My brother was brave, and if my brother was brave, then maybe I could be brave. And I knew then I wanted to be brave, or anything else in the world. So at that point, life changed. All our exploits, bringing doorbells, getting chased by the security guard, golf course, going snow bombs and locking boots. cars, all we see challenge. The true opposite, the true endeavor in mine, came pursuit of the bold omniscient, becoming faced at face with fear, in whatever form of manifestation, and doing battle. We waited for the snake for a while, and gave up on her head, telling herself to come back the next day. we never did and maybe it's just as well. Something's don't belong in the house. Our father said that and now at least I can see his call. My brother, however, has never really given an illness. He continued to hurt can't shake, says a kid. Not loud or snakes, but fully about a wound. He did go up and have a science. Biologists have just last me at the age of 43. After his white bra, first words. He put up a six foot high chainway fence and you're going to see outside right across the middle of the kitchen. Keep his path a while, you ride a flat dog from the jungle you're going to be. The dogs have already torn up and dressed in background, so it's all under one path made of cat. I have an action scene in my dad holding that, but I can actually, the baby I'm getting for a suck-in hazard. 5 dogs sitting just on the other side of the parents. Sparing in heaven, they never enjoy. Instead, parier insult me to see you today. He's very spoke, letting you have to handle up, will be in stores any day. At four, God bless the hamster who has his own. Is it right to bring nature in the house and then put it into the hands of the servant? No, no. everybody can eat this story of some pet, easily a durable or extra, can be fish or anything. Something went terribly, terribly wrong with pet. And if this story didn't happen to your friends, it had to be the brother, the systems. It is sad. So when I was six years old in my young brother's four, we were at the only hamburger place in my hometown. And he had his pet toad, who was left here, and he had his hamburger is righty. And fortunately, He got his hands mixed. They had a turtle who died in the fall and they buried it in the backyard and then the following spring They were planting some bulbs in the area of the yard where the turtle was and they dug it up And it was alive. It had been alive and I don't know. I I didn't start out We wanted to go my fist But I was cleaning their tank and they were in these little pool with the painters and I just didn't  the way that they looked in the little containers and then I don't know Alright I was about to fall down the cliff. I was about to fall down the cliff. When Sterley Kheimen, I was talking to people about this. There was one girl, high school freshman, he was a shadow. He seemed to somehow stand out when he was a star. I got my first hamster and I named her Bubbles. Then I had a boy and he was brown and white. And I named him white-top. I had six kids but she killed, I don't know how she did. And then she had another step and she bit one set off. She's much more of him and she ate the other one. But surely after that she would get there. I noticed that she was good. But we didn't be her  her hamster food. She always ate table food. It was  shrimp lobster crabs potato chip they talk pop juice pudding jello I mean  everything as stuff of tofu is such stuff then I don't know if they will call her to move them so much weight but then one day become home and she real small and I was in the end when she walked she would  wobble and one day me and my mom would go to my brother and we came back she was dead but I just threw out I was not I didn't cry but I just threw out you are crisis, fun afraid I was doing the project as testists, so I had an effect on Craig. Effects the growth on Craig's dish. They ate blood worms. They were in my mom's freezer and I didn't think she liked the idea of worms. It says the blood worms and the freezer. So I just took them out of the freezer and they all melted. It was blood and worms. It just melted. So what I did. It was, it was my big day of love. That's the whole thing in the head. But then I might understand. We died. I think I'm sick too. I don't know because my head is... I had a tip. It died of smells. They are just kick over soon. Why after my sister, I thought my brother and my dad because they did a lot of bad stuff. But my brother and my dad were the half-sauce and they just click on and the nose and they were  scared. So they couldn't let them answer. And they asked their parents, they were , I'm so okay. You think I'm okay? Why stop? I'll come back now. I'll not come back. And I actually thought I wish they would come back. Oh, I just talked about it. I mean, I don't believe in mine all of them ghosts, but I really want these ... Just these scared. Let's start on the cat. It's Tera, I'm not gonna get it. The last outfit. Typical high school freshman, she spoke at study. Wrong outline even the first one. This guy was originally from the Indian cultures . So we'reAAAA FUT UP! Oh my. echt we no one any longer sleeps on clouds! That's Ö quite a bit of a habit of getting into murals But we end up putting in alike story here If somebody we met people up there were allowed to stay still FarmlandENTS 10 minutes more If you're wondering where there was a big day Let's drag. But, good morning, I'm the host of the Lodon right, has the old book from Clemson and left, has the book dedicated to their cars. You get to the empowered body, you see the band. Walkway to each passing band, and warehouses, and group stops, and turns, and trespasses. There is an old fence. On the other side is a right dog, where you need to learn the stories from there. You're not loading smoke, drugs, you're not being biased, you're fishing. The idea says that's right in the box when the most clear person in the entire sense is so bad. Fishman says great place to be chowd. You never fail, the more filthy included body of water in the city is, the harder it is to access the more guys in the sea fishing. And this is an exact assignment. Since I can see these are fisher more and more of these days. Here it is. travel across the country. Men's goals can't happen, but over with a few seconds, river. Dark figures, that's the creeper, and so on, disturb them. And then there's those guys in part, they can leave a more modern, interesting plan here, and she's good fishing. That would be nice. Once a trucker, picking up when I was checking her, I said, he's got a ride, and sighting in here, looks  it's free now, stop the fish fish. Whoever a river will breaks the glasses and you'll serve the sea and start the showlight. there. Stay with me. Last year, I went out on the road to keep her. My name is Kording to the WPA Guide to Florida, early settlers to the skin dead, describe waters. Of every delicate shade of blue and green, tears from the red color of the spectrum, sort of liquid light rather than water, so limp it in brilliance. I allow accounts next to you, practical. jumping into the boat. Today in Miami, it's still possible. That really is a nice orange mango and a kind of trees and branches heading through the morning, near the city of Central Street and anyone from the city perhaps is hoping to stick her wild even on Flagler Street in the northern downtown. Of course, despite the official help, the Greens about Lead Boys named the Asian League Cross-Soowich stop running fetch Most of the Miami River is the obsessed with the runes to some blue yards and has resistance. Still, I found a good black guy's machine, but I don't know what he's trying to say. They had no fish and gold, they had ridd that's pretty inspired to himself here. They tied their eyes, both did not. They talked to him and they grabbed a slack line, ran the pants, then they grabbed a little bit of the pants and they didn't. I walked up and said, go his elbow. One guy, grab the loop, go in his line, said in a thick Spanish accent. Yeah, I got one now. Sure now. Small black and white spotted fish. They won't hurt. See? All five of the scallor drowned in brick. Signing both. Joy spread among the screen. The guy had potted his work spread in. And chopped his feet. But even more side after it, with his respond patient, people. It's a cave base shrimp. Shipping looks  this. First you drive the boat to where you take the shrimp, you're going to be just off and then the warm water around the chicken. You can react to it, it's up and then you put the huge net in the water. Drive the boat and start. Guys call the pickers, so it's stuff that brings you. Sure, going to bucket some of the classic tires in the back of the water. See, they go to the solid shrimp, or anything. They're back in the dock, shrimp, money. It's my enemy, so pop. possible with  carp mugs, issues, tickets to basketball games, the book and shrimp. Detroit. The best way to see Detroit in all its glorious decay is hop-off passing park 14th-th-th-stairst and roof-of-the-e-abandoned train station just west of down there. From this height, the city appears oddly green, and the city lost with the photographer in gemsnotes with Jungkook tickled trap fruits, trees go out over main There's its and common houses. Seeing how nature is begun, we've seen the thing in the fourth game of slime. The street is blown. My friend Mitchell and I drove into Detroit and hit her with gold money. He was alone with him. We went over to Riverside Park. I had been there once last of, see while with mine, guys, you can dare and toss your arms. I once had a park in me. old times, some radio and so on. In the other side, there were kids who pulled up left their car radio and saw, blasting this. Today, the park was first in the end. The children I took turns half-heartedly, passing their line, just  she wrote. I wondered, what kind of stuff you'd find, bottom? Hmm! Troy makes today a succession of lighting and enjoys acknowledge those things. Sir, we don't talk about these people of Tommy. and we'll be coming to realize that they're not talking about action distortion, right? Talking about something more  a trick and certainly . The end of the world means that we see an animal more active than we're ACM machines. What have scattered survivors who are already through Shignar Shipping Carrex around the tax-and-stated cities do while they wait for this end of the world. No fishing course. She caught them. My friend walked here and I arrived at Shekakam and said a testman hearing in their mission. Shekakam was a good squad man in the city. God asked us to sit and have a treat for us to shoot after them. Sound, they call you down and be in court. They call you in the school. Just to garbage dump our service, board ships navigating the same board to see you. That's her huge mysterious white space. real life home switch treatment so the really are is forward motor assembly and now mostly are the site's tires and shirts. Blank light space is exciting. It's  the E-Drag tier engine maps. It's 94. So, nearing Lake Hollywood past black smoke stacks iron pipes, building the super clean, head to a dead end of this. Getting out of the car, saw that the road appeared. the crumble directly into the river, take black and mud. The stash of sewer to cover the mud. On a fess of sign it said, sludge drying trough. Looking rather would have paid for miles of such troughs, but here we are, we're in white space on the map. And of course, at the tip of the den in the parking car. She got us a tricky dinner. While came on over in the attack, it wasn't much strange. Too guys to notice the green triceps. It's not anything you can catch them  Michigan. Catch you here. Guys, that's it. That is pretty good. Sure, why go up late at Lake Michigan? You can just go see on down to sludge tonight, sure. San Francisco City of San Francisco's official fishing gear, spear 7 downtown. Every morning, fishes and the deer fill up with old Asian gods down the hill from Chinatown. It's been all day there and here doing some of most breathtaking art for fishing and ever seen. Abset prostitution never sang a rule. They race back and forth, rear and forth holds, they slowly fill the buttons and fish. Starts retreating at a bookbox named for the answer. Cars and crap. to the end of the period always quiet. It's almost as efficient as it sells for create seconds. The fishermen seem so out of place as they stand in the same sense as the same circumstances, so I'm just  the fishermen fishing on the spot for centuries while the city is great to look at the frozen fell around. Tats. I watched one guy head and he catch all day. Almost imperceptible, space is common distance by a ship. Suddenly, so that the flourish will gain small to new charm. It went into T-button. In the buildings all around us, the staircase stable, economic loops written in concrete class, fishing near empty blocks just in their song, or in the song, etc. As it gained its own background, pasted by the over-the- Trade Rights Department precisely recognized coal. So, we need to start the boat. See me, you can say. Big one of them. These buildings will always be our target. Fishermen's bucket will always be eating. But as the lead afternoon fog surround me, that's the line at the water. It didn't help you think you were so anything happened. Were you strong? When does I start up?
