The girls' cabins are all named after women's colleges. So for people with suburban kids are constantly informing you, I'm an Apache, I'm Mohan, I'm Ambassador, I'm in Greenmont. And it seems pretty simple, but everybody here with us. They'll win that home. understands none of the friends know but that is just a gap between camp people and non-camp I know  all the time during school I'm  I want to go to camp I want to do this game is all I talk about during the year yeah my friends get so mad at me you don't want to hear about camp anymore because  everything that goes on at home you can always think of something that  relates something that happened at camp so then you tell that no for it We've heard about camp way too much. Also  little stories you tell, I'm  you think they're so funny and everybody in your cabin understands them and then you go home you're laughing and they have They give you  a look  when you're talking about it and  that's stupid. Well today in our program we've tried to bridge the gap. I mean camp people and non camp people. So I don't understand what is the cult  mystical connection. Some people feel with their summer camps. Love you be easy, shadow, abugated. National to American life in our class. Today on our program notes on camp. Six different notes. Some recorded out of summer camp and some amazing stories that actually came from you. People who listen to this program are the sub-pop camp. Stay with us.

Spide of all his foes. He was the worst guy ever. Vile and despised even Hitler had a girlfriend so  him. Because you hide it, that's why it's not your hide. Even him always becoming to this camp since he was a batman. No scouts or anything. and the family's, college sophomore, boy with cluburized, actually has no trouble getting girlfriend. A lot of campus exams from that campus camp says that all the best moments of his life you'd be to get an act here for the team people. Camp, it's just number one with everything I do I guess. That's  campus, it's kind of ridiculous because  everything. It changes people's lives. people based their life notes. I would not be who I am supposed to be here. Who would you be? I don't know. I think I enjoy these better now. Be real camp. When you live so close to people  this, it's sort of a couch, but it's  everybody can't just be a close net. It's  a bomb that just happens. And that's why I  a dead camp two weeks ago. It's  a time-worth. And people with some of camp tree David with the difference. A few of us get in real life. what? and camping.

Go, my friends! I'm wearing all of my clothes up! It's the next day of lunch one day. In the mess hall, everybody at camp looks together, and it is constant seen in it. Girls have their own traditional songs, and there's some garisons, and some songs, and all. After the old-discross cabin seems there, it's here, which by tradition is so quickly and all of boys in the middle of the game. girls can figure out what the words are. The oldest boys can know how to stand for the Sponk. Oh my god, I didn't see my brother when I ever liked him. Oh my god, I didn't see my brother. Dave from Smoon. I made that up. What are the words? Well, it's a radio version of the original Mahaik. It's called the Mahaik's song. There's no Hock 1, no Hock twice. Holy jump and Gally G, T's, where's the best enough. And it's clean versus dirty versus swear was it and we start singing lunch because I'm getting trouble So we got to make a clean We got to make a clean one and it just popped in my head and it's it's kind of cool here and I  I started all these things What else When somebody has a birthday  a singing heavy birthday to him.

David is the one who can turn to. David is the man. At least we can see something. The night of the last hemp dance, David wanders the ground, keeping his eye up with her team yard boys and his cabin. Spots to it and sitting two groups in the system. You got four or thirteen euros, shown in circle, sitting on the ground. Sitting on the ground. And, , zip down. is with a man that you use in Chinese. Let's see if it goes to the girl. That's as I said it. This is not a bad marriage. You got there. Did all the doer? Yeah, . You need to do it. You need some pump it up. He's , no, I got it. This is not a man's one. I'm gonna calibrate. Please. Yeah. That's the answer. That's the answer. That's the answer. He's quite good. He doesn't really say anything. Let's see if something's there. So. Hey buddy! He's cool kid. I think he's in the cabin. in general. I didn't need to go right there. Oh, he's in the cabin. I think he's in good. She's really in no. In that hair, hair that she's got to 3-bets. A heart D. Man, I love this man. So, then I talk to her, . So, how's that? Oh, this is fine. him, yeah. I think he's in good. One of the things he most likes about him. Being tells me. It's a constant and going to wrong. It is a soap opera. And David is one of the people who's always in the skits and songs based on the country inside jokes and part, any candy. Better that night after the dance, all of David's 13-year-old, to back in the shian, not in the radio for death. And David gets a report from each one. What are you smiling about? And then... We're just sitting there. We're just talking. And then we're really not. And then we're after we, I think, getting where I just talked about. And then we're going to talk about what's going on. It's nice to see you try to do you good. I was , I'm not a birdball. Because she didn't, well I could have made a move. She didn't. It's a birdball. She... She's not going to make a move. Yeah, I think she won't send me. I got a goal for her. She's got that peanut hair when she says. The always out of the game didn't mean to change. David's got this back. David's in the game's okay. It makes sense you've been when I say that love  I'll just kill a softest silver clap He looks real good he drinks diet coke gets his enemies and my aunt not bowed I wish I was him and get the women's face with all his new friends he catches by I wish I was him and get the women's face with all his new friends Not number two, here. Sure, it's that so sophisticated. We have to now in PlayStation. It isn't for a demon. Realize that you get them living in the woods if you do this. They can be entertained by some of the most stupidly primitive forms of entertainment available since the dawn of civilization. We're talking about scary stories. Every campus got this is so true. You do not even need me to tell the students 12 year olds not as. Avent were wanted to handle that in parenthesis. Can't do it with a ghost story? We have a story of Terry Oman. OK. The turtle man story? Heart. I'll tell it. Long you hooked. A long long time ago. There was this house. Really neat, Paul. This camp was nothing. I can't remember how many years ago it was, but supposedly there was this child's Lord and he was a dishonorably discharged from the military. And who's real real mean to all the camps. The camp shows took food, soft. stole their clothes and stuff  that. He was  beat them and every team's campers were so afraid of them. He said if you tell anyone about me then I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll read their letters. Yeah. Right. Open to all of them. And  one year this campers had a footlock footwork and he finally took them home. And so I'm the footage alive. Guys were oh well he's so mean we should try and kill them ourselves. So they put  fireworks under his bed. We're taking a box, see if they all want to do it. Let's see what he meant to know. So he was supposed to just sit there and then I guess they could smoke in the camps. I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm not even here. So no, no, I guess it wasn't a wall. And he took a mnip of the fireworks underneath his bed and he fell asleep. And while cigarette box he used to put lockers. That fireworks got lit and he exploded. He ran into the... ya Weds full late at the fire. PLEASE DON'T ETH naar Thin Thin Thin Thin and H texts Ted F It's mostly still live. Every Fourth of July he comes back and he takes revenge on a camp where I impose him into the lake. Every Fourth of July he comes out of the lake and takes someone in for his next victim. But what really happens on the Fourth of July is either a counselor or one of the mohawk without ask anyone. Goes into the lake and comes out and scares the heck out of everyone. But yeah, they... Some really leave it. So it's cool. The other kids funny have to handle ghost stories with humans. When producers usually sign or with interviewing girls about the settlement during arts and crafts someday, the Liz's mom, 12 year olds were back a stern and serritarkisher were talking about how they used to eat and come in from years ago, little, and suddenly some of the younger girls sitting in the mirror in the cold horn typed up asking, well, is it true? And then the older girls unsure of what to say, in the course of 17 seconds, pick every possible position. and then you tell other little kids but you kind of cautious it is true it is true it is so logical it is always a logical care so what you do is it is not it is not it is not no it is not it is not the ten year old seems to sit on the cusp of belief and disbelief and this is a very slight mess good damn talking about these stories is just part of the process of trying to puzzle out how does the world that he will. When you're 10, remember, people are constantly changing the stories, murders, and the things is, a lot of the stories are true. So you're still figuring out where is the one? You're in fiction and non-fiction? Yeah. One Saturday night, Aaron Etcher had all of his fellow 10-year-olds and the suit-homers. He can work out by telling them the story of Andy. Handman, which he needs to. Up here. and kills you if you say his name and arms. Aaron said that a friend of his died this time. He said his one died from candy man. He was crying last night because he can't you. He was just going to die so close to him. And that  freaks me out stared away. I was  we did back and went all the way. I keep it safe.

Some of the boys called their arms, they didn't faint. You are  you haven't been in the baby in your hands and you say, what do you marry 50 times? Then you will have actually a dead baby. And what why are they? It's quite a noise, but they  say, you fuck this. You think I don't think so. That's a story. Yeah. It's called movie. It's called movie. That's a story. That's a story.

Their first explanation is that maybe we need to check, fit and not fit. And then. I'm  a friend of mine. Baby, my hand. I'm all paid. I'm all paid. And my works. I'm all paid. I'm all paid. Maybe my hand was , what's going on? So did it work? Yeah. It works in a different way to be expected to. But I felt that I'm saving for a new pair. You took a while after that, and the set of him came back. When I left, half an hour later, he did not see much meat in the car. And that's some camp free. You, well a few weeks ago we invited your stories about camp and you responded. So many of you, so many great camp stories, here it is, a submission. Now we're flying. I was preparing for my father, remarried the day after, exactly a local optical dobe experiment photo, yet we took off between here the worst remarried. And then when I was eight, my mom passed. And we were adopted by, , a nice young couple. I just found out that I... And I remember one year, when  a week after, one week and a half of religious camp, so the farm could do our church, but it had a counselor there. All right. And there is this one guy who didn't look just  my dad. I'm a bit, I don't know, I have a trap. I was convinced that that was my father. And that he had realized he had been a life-earned his way. I had a math that there must be some prohibition on his context until the after he came up with a redemption and I just thought that his way of checking on him. And I would, , say thanks to the leading states, do you remember when I was little or do you fix my dollar teachers? He puts me  I was not coming up to the top of the world girl. But I'm sure and I told my sister, , Tracy isn't that bad. She's a normal court man, but I'm sure. , tomorrow I'll make you feel better. It's great to have saved for that long weekend that was my day. My mother immigrated to the United States, which are many in the 50s. And her understanding of American culture and traditions was always quite here. I want to figure out what I'm going to do. She had a kid to go to summer camps, but she realized that it's usually full of week or hour adult conditions. So when we drove us up to Camp Ground on Post-Naldo and headed up to Camp and let's go back to work. And I was left to charge my brothers, and I was 12, my brothers were 10, 7. We're at the company. We played as the ocean. We played for a little stream that ran by our campsite. We picked things, tried to figure out whether they were edible. The only problem that we had really was that we had to be a secret that our parents weren't there. And this evolved, popped up stealth and substitution. We would notice that campers were the over an wondering where our parents were. So the morning we've got ready to go to the peach. I would have to do the tents and yellin' to the tent. By mom, my dad's going to be a sea ladder. I hope that we've be overfirds doing this. My brother was kind of picked up on this. So one of them when we would see a man in the car driving out the campground, he would see with a loan he would yell after up. My dad don't get the popcorn. We had a car, we were going to get a grocery. We were pretty obsessed with grocery. And a week later my mom came back, we had called her and told her how much we gave some cap and she got the wear extremely spoils. We just appreciate this great outdoor experience that was obviously a big part of my life. The first year I went, I was 10 years old and that was kind of Luke because my parents We're very excited. and they wouldn't let me join the girls' guns because my mother called them a bunch of little brown shirts . And they wouldn't let me go to a fashion malls on her pants because they did believe fashion. So my father is the friend, where his kids went. And his kids went to this very black side. And so they got in. But we had one day as lunchtime. And we got lunch. We got lunch. and it landed my soup and there was a note wrapped around the ground and it said, we don't want no two camps of Wisconsin. And so of course the primary political group people, they got together, they had discussions, they went on and on, they posted guards, we had to pay their faces land, we would show up in the night and so on. And so a bunch of us were sitting in the dining hall and somebody said, look, it happened to last… and there was this large cross-breeding problem. The campgrounds. And these people came and they were all wearing white sheets. And they had these white sheets over their heads pillowcases. And they made us all go outside. And there was another guy in the white sheet in the white pillowcase riding up and down. On a horse, they started to yell at us that they wanted the lousy to use that. It was cut. And that they didn't want no two camps and was cut. And they said, don't bother. I had to call the authority, because this neck of the woods was armed, or the... Everybody was just pacified, and we all stood around. Shake its narguves, and all of a sudden, one of the counselors said, I'm an American citizen. You can't treat me  this. So two of the guys, she grabbed by the... And marched him away. And another counselor said, I'm an American citizen. You can't treat us  this. I'm pretty soon. counselors were being marched away. We were all left there and I got really frightened. So I went, I'm an American citizen too. And somebody came over in a white sheet and took me down towards the beach. And as he was marching down to the beach, he said to me, stay in a quick queue of steps, your big mouth shut. It was all political west from the rest of both the morning. Anyway, I was seven and it 25%. and several men dressed in black holding the scene gun and entered the chapel with different areas. They immediately tied the hands of the four pastors on stage and held a gun on the main path. I think as the Minister of the Man said, if you're a Christian stand up, the devoted stood in the rest ran off. They were kids running all up the woods. And... as we walked to our cabin. We saw counselors with flashlight and bulgur and proclaim it was only a play. He heard kids yelling and persing and crying and it's pretty bad. Thanks to the book called, and seen the music. We saw counselors with flashlight and bulgur and we saw counselors with flashlight and bulgur Now by the way, some of the Green Mart girls explained it all in me. Every year it's the same. Some songs, some ceremonies, circle, and big days, as holidays. There's no hot privileges in cabin nights, and there's the dance with the girls to support the home area for one day. And there's a power. Last year for a session, they took power away, passed because it was  politically incorrect or something, and we were all really upset because power was  one of our biggest camp traditions. Some of our songs. Some of our songs. Some of our songs. 突. Can夏 have a and emotions and everything to it. It's really fun. And then you  challenge. But then second thing I can do is And I just say that it's really interesting and you can't even tell the truth that it's a first thing into song. Heart Camp sings. So it's singing Hello, who's the pound competition. One girl, her talent, her classes are ours. And , Julie can  snap her belly button. I can sing all the vowels into a typical little star. And you're super talented, you're just super talented, you challenge other teams. You're a team's the best you get a piece of all. And the reason I got to begin away last year was because a lot of the counselors felt that it was hopefully in practice because the species that they donate are drugstore. the American poster if you look at it that way. As for examples, the few of the girls pulled their palm from here. So how they want to be picked into the sets is where they drop lots of birds and that means one. We got , I'm of the woods on the camp. I'm kind of a bathroom. I definitely can't pronounce how to walk them on water. They decide jokes that  put into , I'm an adding much stuff that , , any. It's not  even, no one even really thinks about it  that. In fact, faith in the indienice and a part of it, since organized in the century, though, one of the co-found boy stats of America, right at the 19th and the one, Jordan's boys and can make the fight at the cinemas.

Most of the severe surgery tradition, the special songs and ceremonies are apart from so many American parents. And it's not just because they're fun. Panther actor was constant talks as we were together today's program. The financially cannot run a camp without lots of customers. These traditions bring kids back year after year. You have to be singing constantly. and royalty , having made some ham, looking at all the extra rights and privileges and honors within the get-in, turn, order camps. It is part of making the business run. And in addition, it's part of what makes him real. It is using all of the states, all the words that it's always used, seren, shant, heated words, the official honors and officers, but on the part of his second class, real children, making the parts of the fields. I mean, I'm just , I  the tertiary. , it's ,  what's gonna happen? You can , toss things  that. It's , yeah, I come back. It's , , I expect everything to be , way, what's less, that's the right thing to back. , I mean, change. I don't think I would  it. I mean, I don't think I would  it. I mean, I don't think I would  it. I'm coming up. Or what is it good for? Answers. Also the second mention is really Army in one radio show. That's in a minute. The Public Radio International, main hot program continues. It's American life, I'm in class. If you think of that program of course it is a theme. You bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program notes on cam. Summer camp. , how do the question of being in cabs? by her being quite a distinct blue, slow, loyal. Which also happens to be one of the places being never terrified, since ancient times. Why don't David Sin is half as well, who opened America? I mean, the 15 went to a camp run by the Israeli army in Israel. I'm not famous. The camp is around the same village, shot M16s. There's all the time in the city's American Jews from New Israel, and join me for early arms. It's so exciting, because you really... that that is your temptation. You're just really concerned with no one. History of the world is what you want. The lead or the nature of the soul. I love the fact that we go back and to try this. You can see because that's the place where terrorists put a bomb. You just thought so much about the problems. And shout out these three things that we call the bomb. That's what the sails your childhood eat had rather than what? Now for me for the first few weeks what was tough about this was that I was really a nobody in it and I'd always be bringing up a career at always being slow and I wasn't showing myself to be Masha even though there were so many opportunities given to prove yourself to me. So We will always, for no one, running  crazy. One tree to another tree here, up some mountain. Every human, so there's something you could do the best. And I was never the best. But all of this changed. My big status, just completely transformed. what the different units would put on plates. And we were supposed to take off very pills. And this was some kind of competition voting. That's job. So my group with that program are very tell Steve White and the seven. And I would be Steve White. This fabulous game lives seven words. And the principle comes to us. This was one of those moments where I just moved, I was in his own house in my house. I mean, I was from Greenwich Village. I did an actor off my child. But more than that, there's a way that Americans can very free that is really good. That is really good. and precise. And not a what they're doing, even if they're mocking, they have things and stuff. And I have no patience. I address myself just, , I tried not to be too loud, right? I just kind of outrageous for them to get. So, , a little bit of rules, a little bit of loud minor. And I'm here, I'm slick back. and  sort of a decasage. And so I'm lying there and I hear not in the door and I just end up remembering the entire ground, how just how and I just do the most powerful menacing cables just who is there? and My friend, the scenem, Toronto, is really scenem. Oh, Rambo, you sexy beast! And everyone is freaking out, just laugh. And of course, out and all, I think, , members and selves. Oh, I think the man there alone is just, hey! Hey! every thing that's a tired crowd. Just live, just stop, stop. Stop it. And what happens is, no way, to Steve and Clay, I eat the apple as hell. And I need to be recessed to him. So, Rambo comes to kiss, and what we've worked out is to be with his hand in front of his mouth. And I put my hand in my mouth. And we just touch hands and they're kissing our mouths. Distance looks awkward. making out. And I mean, at this point, the campus understanding of the South Korean I've transgressed every boundary that is really man sets for yourself. And they are laughing of the sun. And from that point on, I was no longer an unknowing American over there that I'm afraid of. It's absolutely important. I was  a movie star. I mean, everyone, the Israeli guys, particularly the launchers, toughices, really guys, constantly wanted to do this make out where we put our hands over and house and make out. , we'd be , we're laughing, I'm just really on the height, and I get the design. Just, , you shut all whatever you come up to me and say, it's really funny. when you do this make out, show me do it. Let's do it. And the first few times I would do it. I mean, I guess part of it's  flat. Montreal, future, say it with my proud guys. And some me and anyway. I feel , let's just so weird. I just feel , let's show. I'm just, I don't know. I'm just not gonna do it. Maybe , why not do it? It's very funny. That's all. It's not funny thing. But just the funny. Now I've been to plenty of camps and every camp you're somehow a part of a team. Remember in Boy Scout camp on the horse right? There's the people who wrote horses in the morning. There's the people who wrote horses in the end. And I love bring those and I would love to learn from the other one. I just didn't understand how you can live them. But, is亞 éraysamer vitality the itard farmers the sourice distillation? you're seeing this joy in your group. I just every week I didn't think I wouldn't have thought I could possibly do. And that was so incredible. I knew that was incredible. I knew that was good. And there was never a month where I'd ask myself, I knew it. It's just we're doing that but I didn't think I'd do that. That's it. Adam David said, now remember if our planet money team, they were intended to join the Israeli army in the same team, never worked out. Number 6, cover days. It is impossible to overstate with a big deal of color dancers. It is  any couple words of any campus that it's three days. Once you're assigned team. you will stay on that team all your years, your weddings, brothers, sisters, and you are being named to happen for this season. Such a big deal. Many other timbers mean all the captains all the color they choose going back to use to grow support in this image.

What? After the flag raising up the first morning, the bow sounds slipped. And then? realize why it's instituted first place. What follows are three days of solid wall of sound, the screen. The girls cheer up individual team competitions. They cheer well standing around waiting for their events. They cheer on the way to the mess hall. They cheer outside the mess hall and they cheer on the way back from the hall. They have constant team meetings if they talk about the watching. Those cheering in the dark night is the most important we need to cheer them through here. , it's not normal if you don't use words. I didn't listen to you anymore! Just really important you guys. Really important. Time your math is going to go so far. You run your bot over here as that's what you can say. It is so important that you guys don't have any room to use words.
