  "text": "Let us speak of our nation's monuments. When you're at the Statue of Liberty or standing under the retunda at the US Capitol, when you're at the Alamo, it is clear what they mean. But why? In thousands of tourists go every day of the summer to four corners. That spot in the wilderness where Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, four different states, meet at one point. I went to summer, drawn inextrably, magnetically, that quite knowing why. Just  every other wandering tourist. with in 250 miles in place. Chintas are you with them done this yourself? You've driven three or four hours out of your way. Can you show up? And there's a marker on the ground. Bring by dozens, literally dozens of t-shirt stands. And families come. And they stand on this post, spot four states meet. And what they hold hands, they sit on the ground. And then mom or dad or sis, stands a little platform that have to go especially for this purpose. And take. snapshot. And then, who's this some kind of aftermath moment where everybody should sit and stand around happily  what was that all about? , we came for this and then the next group comes in. The arbitraryness but all I think is lost on mid one. I saw one family with young kids who simply placed a teddy bear on the spot with four states me. Let's have to be sure that. Couldn't any? or corners, called just as much meaning as this place. And my friend, the answer for assistance. And today on our program, we are our own little national monument here on the right, around picture of light in America, our own four corners. From the BBC Chicago, Public Radio International, to American life, my request. Today on our program, four corners, we tell the story of light in America through portraits of light on four different corners and four different states class, this great happened later. That one, history, act two, love, act three, neighbors, act four, how do we become American? Stay with us. That one. Let us begin with most epic of our four stories today. But a year ago, Raider Saravah had a theory that she could tell the entire history of America that describing what happened on and around. What? single street point. Specifically, honor of Michigan Avenue and micro drive. Orange Cago, which does you just swivel around, point, hold dark and inspiring. Here you go. First one. When I started, I had only a few things to go on. A couple of French explorers of plaque on the bridge said passed by in 1673, in Indian massacre in 1812 right there in front of the Burger King, vague notions of a Lincoln's Step to the shooting. the Paggo trip view whose point gothic power looms over the bridge is our side. I thought that's enough American history and I just make up for rest. How is this cool? A cool cool cool. Turns out my theory was only two right. The intersection of Michigan and Wacker I found out isn't just a corner, it's a war tense. The deeper I dug into the history of Chicago and its relationship to the history of the country, the more crowded the ghost traffic jam clogging up the miss. in Avenue Bridge, God. Hey, I'm standing here right now on the Michigan Avenue Bridge. In the Chicago River is right underneath me. There's some duck floating under there and a boat just went by. And here's another one coming out there is where the river meets Lake Michigan to the east. I'm looking south to place where the bridge hits land is the corner of Michigan Avenue and Black or Drive where you can get your vision. or by a nice perk Pope, should you desire? I'm so eviling around, and the view from the bridge is just picture postcard pretty, especially at night when the wriggly building is just lit up so soft it glows. To post it, the building's so dilated, so install and then you have the university of Moscow designed in its image. And you can blame it. The American National Mythology revolves around the ice. the idea that the promise of America invests seed in the West, home, home, on the range, etc. Existentially, that might be true. But economically, the real place to witness the promise of America is the Midwest, where, for most of this country's history, the products of the Range were manipulated for fun and profit. When the cowboy saying, get along little doggies, they left at the part where the little doggie is railroaded to Chicago to be slaughtered by some underpaid, overworked on resterm, electorate on restermist. manifest destiny as a New Yorker's suffer. The first person to grasp the significance of this place where the Chicago River meets light Michigan for Louis, Sholiai, or as he's known around here, Sholiai. Back when his name was still said with a French accent, Sholiai was a 27-year-old fur trader who accompanied a Jesuit missionary named John. market on a canoe expedition from Quebec in 1673. They were to map the Mississippi in the name of France, unaware that Spain had already claimed the river some hundred and thirty years before. On the return trip, at the suggestion of their Indian guide, they traveled from the Mississippi into the Illinois River and then the disclaims. They got out and carried their canoe so that he doesn't mow to the Chicago River, but they got back in their canoe and then fell to this very spot. Right where the river. the Great Lakes, just below the corner at Michigan and Wacker. And Jolly had then had a vision. His map of North America and oddly pretty delicate ink drawing he made in 1674 is concerned with one thing and one thing old water. His America is all Great Lakes and Mississippi. Look close and you can see what he saw. There's Lake Michigan and Edwin One spot. Future side of Chicago. Does it connect to a river next? next to a couple of other rivers that could connect to the Mississippi. This is what Juliet saw. The displaced is a continental hub, the missing link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi and thus the Atlantic and the Gulf. All that was needed was a short canal spanning the miles of prairie between rivers. He wrote, we could go with the village before that in a park and by very easy navigation. Juliet's map isn't so much a map as a props. your ear up against it you can practically hear cash register's ring. Surprisingly they only built a bridge here in 1920. Engineers also strained out the Chicago River and put in massive land bills over there so the lake is further from the corner than it was in Joliette. And I  to picture Joliette sometimes walking up or down Michigan Avenue to the bridge. I go up in his hand for me the Starbucks over there. the north side of the river are the Starbucks over there on the south side of the river it's been in popping lakes alive but into the Chicago River knowing it'll float with facility all the way past New Orleans into the ocean from there. The first person to get cracking on Doli at String, Wachipago's first permanent settler, Jean Baptiste planned to stop a traitor who built a cabin here on the north side of the river in 1779. after Joliet paddle five. Dusobl's mother was an African slave and his father was British. He lived here on one is now the site of a 35 story office tower called the Equitable Dusobl's marriage bed was itself a map of America, the mixing of European, African, and Indian blood to make a son and a daughter crew American children with three continents in their dark eyes. Chicago school teachers  to impress upon their students that Chicago's first resident do sobble was a black man. And just think, it only took 204 years for the town to elect its first black mayor. In 1803, the United States established court the herbornet, what would become the corner of Michigan and black her to protect the portage of the Chicago River. Great! The war of 1812 hundreds of Potawatomi Indians descended upon soldiers and their families to kill them burning down the fort. The site of Chicago was then abandoned for four years. When soldiers arrived to rebuild the fort, they first had the buried scalp team and remains still laid there. Today the site of the fort is weirdly commemorated here with these little bronze markers and better than the site walk at Michigan or Wack. So the choice can dance around its former perimeter as it's learning to chalk chalk chalk. And over here, there's a wildly racist relief sculpture commemorating the defense of Fort Dereborn. For a soldier from the fort is kind of battling off this savage Indian brave while a mother and child are kind of calorie behind him basically waiting to die. And underneath that, as a practice as the people of the fort were brutally massacred by it. Indians, they will be cherished as martyrs in our early history. What it doesn't say is that those Indians technically hadn't given over their rights to this land, but it looks  they ran out of room to put that on the plaque. I'm going to walk around here, back onto the bridge. And I'm looking west across the Chicago. river and if you look down river at the turn in the river a few blocks west you can see the site of the Old Saganash Hotel right over there. During the first half of the 19th century at the Saganash Hotel Chicago and seemed to be play acting to juicy as bits of the country spanking new constitution every night. This story in Donald L. Miller writes at the Saganash in its neighboring hotels, men and women. women of every color in class for welcome and whiskey, song and dance with great democratizers. Visitors from more civilized parts were shocked to see Indian graves spinning the white wives of fort officers around the dance floor of the soggy nash, the frenzy, fiddling and post-happing of hotel owner Mark Boatier. Or white and Indian women drinking comb distilled liquor straight from the bottle. To add an edge to the evening's local white traders would put on feathered heads. dresses and spring into the crowded tavern with war boots and raced tomahops scaring the wits at a tight button these skerners. I cannot over emphasize how much I love that story. Not just the metaphor of it that it is the best ideal of America I can think of, picture of liquored up ladies and dancing Indians, the strangeness of reenacting report, Dearborn Massacre to scare the queasy skerners turning what must have still been an open wound into a practical joke. I love that story as proof of the theorem that then asked today in Chicago the mysterious equation of whiskey plus music equals what the only beat called happiness. The ladies of Chicago wouldn't be dancing with Indian for longer because there wouldn't be any Indians left that's with. The city of Chicago was officially incorporated in The year the Potawatomi Chief stood near the Old DuSauble home and signed away their land in Illinois to the administration of Andrew Jackson. The Found Time and his busy schedule of relocated to Cherokee, Creek, Tracca, Seminole, and Tracca have the Potawatomi removed West to what U.S. government surveyors called Land to support for snakes to live upon. Three years after the Potawatomi signed the way their land and the city was incorporated, construction began on that canal that Jolly had had a vision to connect Lake Michigan to the Mississippi. They can now work pretty much exactly as Jolly had imagined. So much trade moves past this corner that Chicago expanded from a muddy little amlet of a few hundred people who was city of over a hundred thousand in just 25 years. Cyrus McCormick built his McCormick Reaper works right here on the river in 1847. His machine, the Reaper, turned out to be one of the most significant inventions in the history of history. Before McCormick took three hours together a push-off wheat and with the Reaper it took ten minutes. Because McCormick helped mechanize agriculture farms could take up more space and use less flavor and less fun. By speeding up and emptying out country, McCarmic populated the city. Not that the March of Progress is necessary for the night, especially if you're one of those urban workers. Just ask the dead of the hay market, right? Who laid down their lives just 15 blocks from here for the eight hour work day? A recent player Lewis is the jungle about what the stockyard employees went through on the south side. At the Civil War, most of America's grain from the west and the vast prairie around Chicago was unloaded from trains here, traded on the commodities exchange and then sent east on ships from Lake Michigan. I'll within a five minute walk of the corner of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive. You could have been this very spot at the Poet Carl Sandberg was thinking of in his famous home of that Chicago park with... to the world. He called the city toolmaker Stacker. We play her with railroads and the nation's great handler. Stormy has key-growing city of the big shoulders. He's over here, toolmaker. That was the reaper factory on the north side of the river. And over there, Stacker, we on the south side. That was where these giant grains high low-stood. We're now standing at Giant High at Hotel. The player with railroad in Nations Great Handler, that's over there behind the high at where the train tracks were. And , I look right there to go in the leather jacket. Make shoulders. It is my project to tell the whole history of America from this corner and there's no telling of that history without the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was nominated for President pale clearance of Rockaudland. the Republican National Convention in 1860, on the very site by the way of the Old Sagan National Pele, where the Indians and Drunken Ladies used the NANDS. From the Chicago Tribune, standing on North Michigan Avenue, a stone's throw from the bridge, not only campaigned for Lincoln, his editors' top-to-mint running for president and first place. Lincoln was considering going for vice president, maybe. The Tribes' great editor, Joseph Medell, helped found her. Republican Party to advance the anti-slavery cause. Medell was such a passionate abolitionist that he wrote in a tribune editorial in 1856. We are not unbreakingly told that we crowd the tribune with anti-slavery matter to the exclusion of other topics. Weekly guilty. Medell and Company's access to the prison. President wasn't necessarily always in their favor. At the height of the Civil War, they went to the White House and pleaded to get out of the President's new request for 6,000 more Union draftees from Cook County in Chicago. This after the area had already given up some 22,000 men. According to writer Lloyd went, after Medell asked for Mercy, Lincoln turned on him with that Lincoln asked biblical rat scolding. It is you who are largely responsible for making blood flow as it is. at hats, you called for war until we had it. You called for emancipation, and I have given it to you. Whatever you have asked for, you have had. Now you come here begging to be let off from the call for men, which I have made to carry out the war you have demanded. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I have a right to expect better things of you. Go home and raise your 6,000 extra men. Needless to say, Lincoln got his Chicago soldiers. And... reporting the news of President's assassination on April 15, 1865, the headline of the Chicago Tribune simply reads, \"'Pareable news.'\" Not long after the Civil War, the whole city burned to the ground, and Chicago became the place for every major architect in the country. Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, on-down to meet Spanferrow, worked on reinventing what a city-skyline is supposed to look . Montgomery Ward and Sears in Robot Revolutionized Consumer Merchandise, male-order catalog sales. Montgomery Ward was just too black for Michigan Wester. In 1920, Al Capone came to town, the same year of prohibition went into effect. When year after that, Vincent the Schemer fruitsch, a member of the piano band in Gang, British Fife. Please, drove onto the Michigan Avenue Bridge just as it was opening to let a boat pass. Jump to get, only to press straight into the other side. That gates pass. Manufacturing at the corner gives way to the service economy. Now, it's all thanks and advertising agencies, law firms, skyscrapers instead of rear אני pen county. Railroads give way to the world's busiest airport on the North Side of town. If I may skip ahead in the interest of finishing this story before tomorrow morning's paper arrives, for me by the way to tribute, drop full of those anti-slavery streets as you. Only an eight-minute walk from the corner is the sight of the first Kennedy Nixon debate. The place you could argue, her modern televised democracy begins, since that's the debate Nixon was said the news not because of the issues, but because he looked so gas-bleased sweaty. on the lights. And just to short-walk from there is the building where if you have their ran playboy magazine during its eight-day. As long as we're on the subject of the decline of Western civilization, if you look over there to the second story of the NBC Tower tucked between the equitable and the trip-une, that's where they take the Jerry Springer show. The Jerry Springer show. It just wouldn't be the haunted landscape around the Michigan Avenue Bridge. some symbolic television apocalypse did not happen here each day. Booking guests who's near constant profanity makes the show into an unintelligible barrage of beliefs. Watching it is  listening to a constant storm warning, which is exactly what it is. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but one way you can measure the end. importance of this corner to our national psyche is the number of times it shows up in motion pictures, specifically the action has been turned on. Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson, Kevin Poster, Sean Connery, Tommy D. Jones, Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, Kevin Speedy. There's barely an actor worth the cover of entertainment, weekly who has it been in film with the sea shot right at the corner. And why? Because these films are about the motion of planes, trains, automobiles, boats, helicopters, motors, cycles every modern means of transportation. And so, where better to film them to the place that the recent trees ago were spotted as our country's leading transportation hub by Hollywood's favorite, unintentional location scout Lewis, Sholiette.

I'd  to ask you a question today about four different visions of America, told it four different street corners across the country we've arrived at it too. For Scott Richer and Julie Riggs, on our west end Baptist Church, thanks for ever. It builds and builds continually until it comes to the point that brought us to where everything is so outrageous, our emotions were so curving wildly out of control that we all we had to do and to push ourselves, to put everything ourselves into our minds, for much or something else. Asside you situation was, Scott and I had been madly obsessed with each other for years but we had always just friends. And I was in a relationship with Tom. So on this summer day in this time and our relationship and our friendship where we were just friends, I stopped by his apartment or his house, Obama and Broadway to visit. Now we had a real nice afternoon, I think we hadn't initially referred to weeks. From the side to there we always left. always make it happy. And then Scott was busy day for you that was  good fortune. -huh. A lot of days, which was fun, but it was bitter sleep. And always able to go away from being happy. That was so much fun. And meanwhile, I'm sitting there going this. This. This is horrible. how happy she be happy about what's happening here. It was almost  twisting the night See then I got in my little bed box bag left and said I was sitting on the back porch of our house It's a very touching setting Tomt, summer afternoon, my roommate Jason came out and sat down and tell that I was affected by emotion and He said something to the effect though sometimes we'd rather have a feast or famine He got something about a drought or a flood a drought or what yeah, yes, so I decided well enough of this thing and I decided to take the gamble and I got in my car, race the down Broadway. Then after new traffic, weaving in the car is trying to catch her. I'm just crazy to long. I'd love  15 minutes before that. I think, yeah, I promised myself, well, if I catch up to her before we get the central park, then I'll pull her over and I'm going to kiss her. What are you doing that for? And I did catch her right at sinful park. Right at Central Park, I'm driving in my car and I look over it. There he is. And he's , blow over, blow over. Let's go in on completely confused. So I pull over into this parking lot right on the corner into this Southern Bump district parking lot. We both got out of our cars. And we just got to start to start to start on which car lifts park this now. It was , , , in a movie or an adroit, if you have an adroit and everything spinning really quickly, and all of a sudden. and just the one spot where your standing stays still. No idea what happened there. We both felt something tremendously powerful. Our hearts were racing so fast. And all the background was just kind of from South, all the colors did really saturate. So then... No. And I don't know. Nothing happened. Did you just stood there? Well, something must have happened because we're talking about it now. So what exactly did happen is I think what I don't know there was something happened. But it just seemed to me it seemed  being there. That was me. my confirmation that there was something that they still going on inside to that hole. Everything wasn't hopeless. Every time I drive by the park, I actually went there to face twice that she's not able to know about just sitting in the park. It's a pure story ends. You'll be so boy-picked. with a lot of social assets, and about that, Scott, finally, it's important. He's got to be good at two years. The funny thing about the situation was, it wasn't the first time that we were destined to have our first case in this bit. Really? Because we were in Paris together, eight months earlier. And we're having a really great, state of really late, than the quarter of a new task. Star. So, Harris talked about it. We should have just been. But we can. Because we would be our guy. Because we would be our guy. Even after I broke up with the guy, still took so long. Who really? Yes. How come? I wanted it to be perfect. I wanted it to be something. You wanted to wait to spring time on. Oh, close up, clear. , I thought, well, when we were in Paris, I... Well, there's the other guy where Paris and there's a post-of-all in love in Paris So we can't do it here. It's so typical to be in Paris now our first kiss was in Paris The home on car you can you only have one one opportunity to have your first kiss And you miss so many They finally had first kiss and starts living Cheek. Coming up, God stead people in a mystery and what it takes to become an American. It's an operating with national. This American life in my class, each week in a program course which is theme in the variety of stories in the days program. Four corners, the attempted to bring you a portrait of life in America by telling four different stories, four different street corners, and four different parts of the journey. So far in our program, we've pretty much had it. asked for that matters card and now we have left next three bebers. My patternedity has this story, what makes community is cemetery important mean. These entrance stands on a long and quick. The West Ends of Attariots, full of old dead captains, soldiers from the war of 1812, kids that died of cholera, lives who after six or eight or ten children just gave up. There are rich people under violence. The long crowd ofacyj has walking with us out. with that so much as a wood marker. No one's been buried here since the middle of this century, so the place is fallen into the super-per. You see a lot of the marble and shell headstones, puzzle pieces on ground, understanding and crooked attention. About 10 years ago, the cemetery was popular hang out for prostitutes and junkies, but now it's just dogs and their owners. When I first moved to town a couple years ago with my girlfriend Sarah, we walked our dog in the cemetery. There was a sky there and in depth, a big blonde American Indian. From the duckwater tribe I'd think. It sort of qualified as my first-branded apartment. He told me how we grew up in Nevada and was stopped at my white parents and raised in a little redneck town where people didn't  kids. He'd moved around a lot and I pictured him as I was now. The stranger in a strange place. What would mean the cemetery? sometimes twice a day, whatever the weather. Or rather, we were both in law-playing and dogs. His was a wolf mixed in kian, but a vacant slightly medicine blend in a lot,  to wrap up the puppies. In mind, it's a simple mudding trout. His passion for chasing squirrels, follows her life-on commitment to rolling in teeth. Humor beating, always the cemetery, sometimes up to eight hours in a row. He said he worked at night, supposedly for a look of scuba diving outfit, and that's why he had so much free time and day. He told stories and the stories about his high school football exploits and blown out me the nittis college career and safety. He talked about fishing, how he gilded in the rivers of southeast Alaska, and then how he used to go up front of the house, now they weren't together anymore. And she had the house, and this here, a country. your way, walking to the Stob and people  you. He didn't seem angry at all. Now in fact, he seemed happy. every day he was happy he had been the day before. And because of it he was good at drawing people out. It connecting with various factions inside the cemetery so that everyone stood around, nodding down  this thing to chat with our bliviest man, holding forth on the collar for perfect shampoo. But can't I take her pot and flush at this? This is not the way things usually work in so-called journey. The mere fact that I knew just the things was unusual. Usually people didn't interact at me. Instead we knew each other by the handles. There was Dalmatian and father of three speckled dogs, one to whom the smoke was silent and they were very happy. We were able to get out of the camera, legally walking for trio of grey hats until the day that light full of it. They have to replace craftsmen during the blood-resistant market died. There was the man who walks and reads, He says, \"...in the lawn-chair family.\" And all his brothers, 50-something-some daily set-up that they're holding chairs. They have to cemetery gate. And the pickup artist, brought him to know him to see. And there was crazy shouting, owner of three rag tag mats, Elder Statesman of the cemetery. So when I finally talked to him, I was a crazy shouting man at all, his name was out. Those people have lived. that I've seen all the time, some of my seat gears, and I don't know their names. I recognize them, they recognize me. We talk about all sorts of things. It's just never really a curse to you to ask their name because  their dogs. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? It's my birthday party, I've always had this. I've just got my vacation to get one of these people. Talk to you a lot of the cemetery, you'll need some bread. I was , no, I was , no, I was , forgot my name was , did I never know? I was , no, I was , this was not somebody that I just knew very casually somebody I probably walked with three or four more days a week. Those were the lot more dogs than the people. It's just, who's worth no use . Even today, what strikes me as amazing about the cemetery, is that there are people here. People who show up twice a day and see other people here twice a day for years. Many of them just don't know each other's real name. Let alone with the other desperal living. Retreams of it night or lobster. hates. They just know each other's dogs name. So when they refer to one another they might say, Cersei's mom said, look, bones are full of preservatives, which is why she cooks around. Or when they bump into each other downtown, Christmas shopping they'll say, Elruis mom, nothing left to say, say, how goes it? Who's this intimacy? Or it can complete back to the scene. Sometimes it felt  both are once. You had the warmth of intimacy and the comfort of hiding behind your dog. And yet every day you saw people at their most naked talking baby talked to their hounds, kneeling to pick up poop. I asked my friend Shirley Rubin's mother about this. Thank you really get a sort of a window into people's, I don't want to say, well, into people's souls. , you watch people very intensely. walking around, throwing the ball, interacting with their dogs, or totally ignoring their dogs. And going through their own pace and everyone's allowing for their dog, ? I mean, I'm just , I'll get to the kids' dog. Here's the alley, yeah. And when I see people hitting the dog, I'm , listen, Paul mayst do that. I know who really really likes their dogs. He does, I know people who got trophy dogs. People who got scruffy, his ugly is dog. I really really love that dog. I think it was a love part that you're going back to the cemetery. And then it became my social hour, my escape. Where I'm off and I'm not. I find Jeff and Keon. The minute Jeff realized that I was a writer, he went to the library. No, over the course. but we've read everything I'd ever written. And then to my horror, I wanted to talk about it. He did this kind of thing with others too. Hmm. When the leaves began to change during my first October in the West at Cemetery, Jeff was already talking about a Christmas card he was playing. Photograph of Keanu himself. He brought it up successfully. But how Keanu was going to have a haircut in Chamiffix. have her nails clipped and how he had arranged for a photographer and how they were scouting locations. There were ups and downs in the saga as it played out over weeks. The good location that might not work out the day of the shoot if for no extra hit. The need to time everything just perfectly so the canner would leave the beauty parlor and then immediately sit for a picture of course you can come back to the cemetery and get money. In retrospect, there were little clues even then, and something strange was gone out of Jeff. While he said he owned a truck, I only ever saw him at bus stops around ten. In the Scooby-Dead, later when I called various outfits of pork, no one had ever heard of him. In the end, he had photographed take it at seers. He and Keon and the stiff and smiling pose of the civil war era has been in line. He and his familiar blue sweatshirt, hoping for Keon and his perfectly cool. He was beaming running into the Christmas card evening, literally beaming. After Christmas I left Country for several weeks when I came back sometime after a massive ice storm, there was nowhere to be found. Summary glittered with glazed headstones. Today's time to travel the story because people didn't see more. I want to talk about it, didn't seem to want to talk about eating. Everyone just bundled into themselves. In Japan, he was a very touchy subject, one that suddenly made us all feel defensive. What I learned was this, he did help problems and infections in coming. He went to the hospital at the same time that he was apparently forced out of his apartment. Money was tight. He asked someone for the cemetery to live up. Another line crossed. That had worked out. Kiana was taking to a candle by megan, Mattie's one. Now she was calling the candle regularly to see if Jeff picked her up, but he had. Week after week she called and closed clear that Jeff couldn't or wouldn't pick a piano because he was gone. That's when Kiana was adopted by some of us. Here's megan. You just started talking about the stuff that somebody didn't realize. I didn't even know this person. with Jeff, I mean, it was  you knew everything about his life. But in the end, how much of that was actually true? And, , you didn't even notice, person was , August to December and he was gone. But it seems , correct. There are completely unsubstated rumors that he'd rub the bank. Someone knew someone who's cousin that seen his photo on a Boston newscast. Maybe, but then most people were quick to accept this fact. In a weird way, I wonder if we thought that the trade, because Jeff had broken the simple rules of the cemetery, it become too intimate. Now he was gone, and it was hard to say, hi, let alone catch someone else's eye. During those dark winter months, the cemetery became kind of haunted, trustless place. In one of the endless conversations we had about a later, some people worried that you knew where we lived, someone threatened to track it down. But what for? So that he might never... ever again, they have brutal other hapless dog gnar's, other seaside towns, into chatting about dog-each and food. Sarah and I kept the Christmas card on our refrigerator. Right up until a couple months ago, actually, when it quietly fell to a new rotation of refrigerator photos. We kept it there and hoped I think that he would come back and explain where he'd been. Probably certainly couldn't have robbed the bank. And if he had, I told him. myself maybe it was because he had to. Maybe he'd been interested from a life he'd imagine for himself with a dog to keep unconditional love with friends he was guaranteed to see every day and he had a couple of bad breaks. Got sick ran out of money, lost his dog and then panic. Now time is passed, people come and go and every six months the galaxy inside these gates breaks are leaking. figures. Dogs die, people eat from nursing homes. Others move or arrive. And every day, today, people are here walking in spectral circles  their amector, circling the kawak. In general, I'd say things are back to the way they were, each map but not as me. You stand around with dumbfounded joy with 10, 20, 30 other gave me grommetalts, reveling in simplicity of stupidly entertaining dog play. This is the opportunity for each location, this is our mission man's self slash side. language at his death Dalmatia. The pickup artist still works as magic. The launch air family still sets up by the cemetery gate each day and cover their legs with wool blankets. Fact is, even without somebody  Jeff from people together, he stand on a corner with a bunch of strangers but long, eventually something happens to bring together. Sometimes, something's small. The other night I went to the cemetery at sunset. There were the same broken headstones, the same sea captains, offers. And there are all these living people too, only now me as Trout's dad. Or as the guy who's stupidly named his dog, Trout, or however they're seen. The dogs were playing hard, racing with circles, not wanting any of it to end. And that gigantic moon came up. Right, he left tantraine. It was the kind of moon that stills everything. And we stood in the circle watching it rise. For a minute or two we just stood there, going orange. Dogs didn't resist at all. Mike Patrononi was part of Maine. That course had a common American. The other story about a few of the things that are hard to understand, stand on planet and come to the space. It was exactly me. And the last of the weekend breakfast crowd filtered out of the dining. In the boost line back wall, a young woman made her ready to put it in the chat. She was tall, with reddish brown hair and shoulders. She had a tattoo or a left wrist, a delicately-ached silver and a double-bed-pan. All around the bus boys, the nurses, the dishes, flattering her lunch drinks. Lupid, I was called from the line. She turned around and frown. Standing next to her with dark stock, and on that a few black bears probably sharply had his cheek. This mild sheepishy carried a tray and probably balanced plates and glasses. Hello, hello, she said, your Zion-Dayser commission. I didn't realize you were too. Yes, said, his English too form crackling the Spanish and you glanced at the accent first. Pedro got a job and he brought me. I've been here a few months on so I should be waiters and my English is much better now than you've lost. The dishes on the tray rattle is a stroke of crash and floor. Yes she said starting up the door of the dining. So I would encourage you to give it a try and follow her out to the corner. She pulled on with sunglasses. I haven't seen you in a long time. Now it's finished. She notices it in 10 minutes which calls after 20 minutes. I haven't seen you since, well, , just sets in very cool things. But I always look for you any out of the streets, wondering how you are in the past. For four, just in a pair of young men walked around them, one carrying a sheet of pliers, the other a roll taping stamp. They stopped and put up some of the papers on the telephone call. Next, the two men, young girls, left a slurred pole now. that an upcoming dance contest that local club. Luka lowered her glasses enough to read and register the information. Go and watched. Well, you can call sometimes just a call, not for anything you participate to let me know how you are. I worry about you, I'm sorry I didn't call because she pushed the glasses back from those. It's just that girl who said I mean, we married after all. Luka left. No, no, you're a man. You knew damn well this was just a convenience for me. A business deal. I can't help but that you spun all these stories for your family. But it's not right, Helpset. I thought we would live together. I never agreed to that, that it had been a condition. I never would have married you. She was squinting her mouth as dry. You paid me for something. All I'm doing is getting my end of the bargain. And that doesn't include hanging around with you, your friends, or your family. Well, I think you need me to set this lower lip jutting out  flesh and flesh. I'm a good man, I can help you. You don't get it, I would loop a set shifting away from one hit to the other. She stood a name, scratched her hand. I don't know that you'll ever get, but it's a place to say that I don't need. We're not family, no matter how many justice you've been swissed in from. But of course we are. No! You have your people and I have mine. But yours, that's not your family. You need me to help you stay in touch with your family. With your Latin self, he said, angrily. He shoved one hand in his pants pocket and used the other to poke the air. Mexico, this wouldn't happen, and you'd have to do it with the set. There are laws in it. Looking at the hand, it next comes. We'd never have married, how we, Mexico, you wouldn't need to marry the night. American girl. At your American is an accident to jogger. You're running away from your life and self-incisited. I know who you are and I know who you are and I know who you think you are. I'm a man who's seen a little bit of the world. I mean I've got a college but I know and I know you. Oh please, just started walking away from the corner. He shook his head, sadly, and went down up to tips to the screen, covered shoes. They need to go following your steps behind. I didn't want to do this, he said. He'd give him new choice. Suddenly he grabbed and threw her against the fire cover telephone. What's the fuck? These things you're doing, she demanded, kicking and scratching at him. I didn't want to hurt you, said an abortion grant. I tried to carry this realm with me all by myself. And then you could be new choice. Yen threw up, pressing his body to hers, and forcing me to face the face from him. She could see his force. He held her on that. moment. Then seeing the men flyers across the street. He's , go, hit me and I'll kill you. I'm not going to try to step away. Letting her hands martial art style. Hey, she held an English to the two men across the street. This guy's trying to kill me. Can you call the cops? The two looked at each other's wear of them back across the street to the middle and the battle stance. Rollers cry. The things you accuse me of. throw all the things that you do and say, wipe in his eyes and practice this. Well, I finally went and did one thing. It hurt me to do it, but I'm a man who couldn't put up this in long. Hey, leave her alone. One of the men yelled from across the street, but it was lack mustard. Second man walked slowly back to the dining room at a flat advertised pump and fell from the inside. I don't want you to understand, and besides switching back to Spanish, I don't know what the fuck you're talking. But I'll tell you this much, if you keep this up, I'll file a police and government will progress what we do. And you will be shipped back. Do you understand? It didn't react, which is said. Instead, you took deep breath and got this down. Did it? I was. Did what she asked, confused. I cheated. I said, I just stared at it. Should have taken past... I was with another woman who said, since she wouldn't act  a wife, just can take her one. And I had an affair with that. And she didn't. She was stunned by the focus and sororities and was a son who said, that's true. I think that's good, though, she probably said. I think it's good that you get out and get involved. I'm sure that's true. We're not really married. We're only. We go, she smiled, she talked, I'm desperate, supported. I would close the signs, tears escaped in the months. Oh, you are called, whole woman who cried. She was cracking in this face hands and me. Why did I have to know, she called woman? She called, you did marry, called, married lesbian. Covered. tears of poems of his hands. I don't want to hear that. You shouted, no, no, no. Lupus side is sure. That this is absolutely not worth, she said. What of herself and to none? Cops are on their way, so the man become that he'd un-estrolled back across the street to his partner and serving his witness to how old and lupus are in. How old is she? Her voice softened. Pops are to shooting his promotion, his problems. So we can drop this, just go ourselves. Okay? We can't get through this. Yeah, I hear her, she said, That's why I'm telling you, Please go back to the restaurant. I'll just leave, and then perhaps get here, and you can do any body problems. We're still married, assistant. There's nothing else about it. Just one more year. So don't blow it yourself, she said. Please don't bother me. We'll try my patients. Remember that I can write back on wrong side of the group. They thought silent and would sack the asked, not even a wrist, and acts, she said. This smile would already give no, the car of men's behalf of us. Yes, she said, it necessary to be a platform, a little embarrassed. Pro-worship the sins and thoughts. But I have to take my money. She is my money. I earned it. You looked up and she refused to make that contact. You should get back to work. Perhaps it is your own moment. And I can. We can buy, see my mother, and we just call sometime the house. We never give up to you. Are you sure? We can set the lock door. The sharp skies put across the street in the sentence, Prowen watched the shiitake to me. At her moment, men churning left. Prowen turned to, and quietly wandered back to me. By the time the squad caught our lives on her, no wings. Pachio de has the cultural critic, Peshka de Tribn, and slayed me, rag.
