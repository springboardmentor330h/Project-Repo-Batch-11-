  "text": "in WBE's Chicago and Public Radio International. It's a American life. It's a life of goals. Start from the top. I needed a driver. I couldn't drive. The problem was I wanted to have my same life, my same nice little, , suburban. Getting the car driver everywhere at life. Prejib was going fine. In midlife with care. She had stuff to do. So she took a mad. the hired somebody to drive around and in Harry. Nice guy. First day it picks you up in the van, takes you to a daughter's school at the end of the school day. The waitin' line, the other parents. And Harry chum-towt and started with his whisperer, , open up the van, open up on both sides, , whispering and tidying it up. When Harry and Harry were parking the handicap space, or if that was an available. you park on the grass to save bridge in a few steps. She asked him to take her to the grocery store. Anyway, so then we get out of the grass. I know he's he'd been wanting to help me apply the elbows. And if you wanted to help, he wanted, he says to me, is we went into the grass here? Let me get the basket for you. Let me carry you, Ben. I said, no, no, I'm fine. Oh, he says, please, let me, I'm here to be of service for you. And he kind of shatter me throughout the grocery store. It's just... And so, , can you? Why does that? Why don't you go? I get mad and then this also feels  it's trying to help me. Ooh. What I think he really wanted was, , to help somebody out. When you do something for somebody else, it always seems so simple. You just want to help. But if I keep forming a relationship with that person, and it's just as complicated as anyone. relationship you can have. Or  any other relationship, if you're not attentive, whether you're the person actually wants, it's easy to wonder. Which is why doing good brothers is so difficult. Certain religions, the question of how to do good, is kind of obsession. Among my people, you're Jews. It was traditional, very big deal. In fact, one way to understand all Jewish law is a set of instructions from doing good in the world. Desit of instructions, as you'd said, so complicated, spanning so many centuries and thinkers in the 12th century, for us running my monodies. actually make a crutch, summarize it all, at least in the eight different ways the person can do good for others. He listed in order of preference for least desirable to most. Below a level of doing for others is giving grudging away and just giving less than you should but giving it cheerfully and giving after being asked, giving before being asked. And it continues on up through the most Maritory Square here, which is telling me in a blink. person that you're helping to become self-spit shit. So I don't need help anymore. Today on our program, stories of people trying to do good, why they often fail, and why they occasionally succeed. Our program today is just two acts. At one, you can't come again. Story of two people trying to restore a small town to its former slender, and how the biggest obstacle to that to be people whose lives they want to improve back to. Climbing Terriers! XON gift chat with writer Philip Bravich about his encounters with international do-gooters, that we wanted, of course, a well, a genocidal murderers, and about Rick, of course, of London. Stay with us. Heck one, you can't go home again. You guys who cottonfits, get here, then old highway 61 through Southeast Missouri. Remove настоящation, up to 18,000 remains where and And you drive into canal in Missouri. The scientist says, population 390 men will be our mother's saying, hatement ends. Then this must have gravel roads and trail humps. Businesses are main street aren't just closed. Oh, put it down decades ago. Maybe the rest of us goes to school. Maybe he's come here from all the surrounding fields. McKenney Warton is what Jackie talked about. What it was  in canal in the kids. It's  they're describing a dream, canal in general. This was a place, I'm sure  you had a hard time trying to find a place park if you had a car. We had a backpack in the showfam, and people were coming down this. Oh man, we planted a few letters up down the streets and the women be this and kids be playing with playing to two o'clock in the morning with the kids. And the shander kids were they asleep in the back seat of the car. because when we give out. When I pulled into the town, I talked to the police. Before you wrote it was an extraordinary and a muddy shirt, but on his face, no shoes in the comb, is playing in drainage. These ditches line both sides of every street in town, as there's no sewage in here. Most people live in trailers, not regular houses. Some people empty their septic tanks, straight into ditches, kids play. They are acting, and they are soft. money everywhere. And I don't forget to score your touch of face to expect, got in the rational face that even the doctors have to say Louis, but I don't know if I can hear it. This is the town Kenny and Jack can wait to get back to you. Anyway, we, , let's tell him we're so little town girl. We got married in one way. We're just, they say you're signpost. We've been gone. I guess we've gone about 40 years. And this has been a dream to combat them and build home. In Saint Louis, Kenny had been a supervisor at the Dalantthus, who were in the living of houses suburb to raise two kids, active with neighboring associations and borders. In the court, once in the back to Canaloo, they were trying to bring back some of the spirit they remembered growing up, but it's a success. Maybe start a little bit of public part, swings, trees, put up a gym, kids could play ball. Kind of straightforward innocent improvements. Start to imagine that anybody would oppose in. This is the story of why they can. Why people did turn the vaccine for it. By three years of using every skill they have, but it can't achieve, but it's not worth it. But it's something that changed in the spot. So we'll take a lot more of the two-degree restor of Earth. I'm not putting climb over the river or just walk around. I know how. Now, by being false, he'll just glass in his mouth. Rock! Fallen hurts yourself! I didn't do that! I didn't do that! I didn't do that! I didn't do that! Quickly across the street food quarters is a trailer where Susan Drake lived through five year old daughter Rachel, great-month-old son Dave and her boyfriend Brad. Thanks to their trailer, one house down is a lot that used to be in order with Perishop. Shopper down 10 years ago and nobody has cleaned up the site. The nessa burkinlish house twisted at 10th the raid, stationary auction walls. stackable tiles. In short, you're a visible place for any small tile, including Rachel and France. Susan and Brad and Rachel people. You want to open or fridge or I just stand in here? And go with standing wide open. There you go. Right there. Can I get in here? Well, it's the same right there, but if you really want to get in there, you can get in there. But that's dangerous, by the way, when you get inside there, that door shuts, you can't open it from the inside. You're stuck in there, you can die, stuff Rachel, consider yourself. We were the cars, though. We were the cars. We were the cars. We were the cars. Cars were Rachel likes to play or just repeat that. There are two dozen old pilots and Malibu's Chevy sitting on the pants, lots of grass, clients. Brad chooses this day, they visit us once. They do some child衣, Dr. refrigerator business, just won't say the same celebration schedule today. of the world. It's a card at the ground. Looks  it's not the problem. Kids, kids, kids. Rachel, meanwhile, tells him I'm about to move swing with kids' values. Is it dead, power line? The hands with top, telephone, primary band, school. Kids swing, phone quiet with loud. It's to walk through the road. It turns out that this lie should be cleaned up in most places. Not necessarily at a city of pride, but at least at a fear. Somebody who gets hurt and soo, you own. City. This property belongs to Susan's cousin. Jim. Susan and Brad said, all the town has to do is threatened. We take it. So patient. He would clean his bed. But he's never been pressured. They don't have to stay. Who's gonna spend money that don't have to spend a nobody's told him to spend any money? Nice wife. I find that. Nobody's. Nobody's crushing. We see that. This ridiculous, what? I mean, lights. Yeah. That was a whole lot. That's all it is. It's a mud hole that they ought to build up. There's nothing here. There's no bike. There's nothing for kids to do. Time to go to the shenanown and eat some of those stuff. We're not going to be a good one. We're not going to be a good one. The real story was that you kept your place right back. If car was brought down from the street you had come for hours to get used to it did itself. That's exactly what he had. She and Kenny moved back to the house in 1999. And it wasn't long before Jack started the ladies auxiliary to get me some good funeral projects. It was three days. That's it. over a dozen. For his money, they sold stuff with flea-mortons, delivered hearts, flowers, and power and power plants, who fundraiser dinners. And after a few months, they earned $2,000 in profits, and they have to start soft-buck for a neighborhood party. And at this point, the saga of the Nintendo Switch is gone wrong. Yeah, we started several projects and my wages went mad, opposition, and of course, because they just couldn't understand you. The ladies are accelerate gave up for a Christmas basket step problem. Tam we had for a competitive piece of medicine. They gave up 133 baskets. We did not get one thank you call, but we got five negative calls which there did six sets because that's all we got. We were angry for some people because we left the basket and we wanted to. and some didn't  us knocking on the subject. Oh, we got one right, he starts, say, had Nishi didn't  me and he said, I'm just kind of saying, shh, you said, I said, what was sorry, we're, we're problems, all of us. For can't you say, , we're sorry, we're sorry, one good, not for sorry, you're not, we're sorry, we're sorry, no man we won't leave in Tangheng, your door again? Or can you say you, you have a life? Meem-wong, can he try to get a grant back top of the streets? Start a things-in-motion to get a sewer system on it. Try to get junk through the yard. Huck through his neighbors, not booming the restaurant, grocery store, back to Main Street. Maybe get the hat back, and you got an ORR grant to sit up. Some of their subcontracting work out of the mail. Generates and jobs. And before that, the 65 year old retiree looks. a lot a youthful woman from Johnson, kind of self-riding from there. I just told him I was interested in clean up town and making it nice and everybody that I talked to was, well I'm not registered vote but I'm sure they'll vote you wish you're a need at and I got a more graduate vote, they go to Priscilla again. This is it. I understand why I can't pass. Visit a Charleston case, Southern. Hannah. to grow up in the share car park and sell. Charles's people, farmers, ladies, , must of the older people, big cottonists. Hand picking stopped about 15 years ago. Now I went to the machines. That's where the world messed up grown up machines. That's how the heck can come down here and talk about it. Yeah, he's a bunch of men that sit here. They're all these pack-mops. They're basically a little bit below. That way. American citizens have more jobs. Stay give. Great. The Southern is run alive, faith is in the strongholds, a worldwide trailer, additions of their own. In the living room is big tank, which size gold is, which they sell as pets and as they. It's a child's southern strikeway, because the town's one's son is, but lots of other junkies are there too. And old wagon, and cables, and panels. And the wideest sort, non-descript, rested out, pieces of machinery. There lots of them. 7 kitchen trussies in S. What people thought of you? Why he lost your lunch? You won't get true to you all the last months because he's going around trying to run this town telling everybody how to do things and how we're going to be done. He says, he said, keep your yard clean, you weren't going to have no toys, you weren't going to have no garbage, no trash, and no car junk car in this town. If he's going to do that, he'll be back where he comes. from down around Memphis. You don't come into a little time  that try to take over and run everything. This time, in this way ever since it was built, one guy hate or change. That's where he makes many enemies and couldn't get elected. Just play it smart and when long with everybody in there after you got elected try to do this thing, he might want. In a sense, he made exactly the kind of political error that professional politicians always try to avoid. He told voters that they were going to have to make change in the cells. They were going to have to sacrifice, but then have to get off their butts, the changes they've heard. But, may this is especially hard to listen to, as the fact that the candidate made a lot more money, even retired than most people in town. Many can never do that. Let's get food stamps, rest aside. So it's getting his retirement chance. Jackie, and 128,000 600-foot. with dollars at 54 cents for the quarter-solution back in 1984. Checking Kenny with the talk of the time for a while and they actually built a garage for the cars. With an electric garage door open, the first and only born internet were. These were the people who were going around to own people what to do. City people with the city ideas, the aunties were there. They were wondering, did not believe Tony was even from Canel. Add to that, the room is the photo-free town. Kenny was going to make it illegal. or more than two cars. The Kenny is going to force people to give up older model trailers. The trailers are mean street, but trailers can come. Kenny made a man get rid of a goat. He kept him his rod. Who was it, Robert? I know, he can't up here and tell him, wait, my yard's junky. So when you got clean this stuff up, so if you don't want to leave your ticket, you go to pay a fine. you, if you was out here, there's old tires, and I know you've seen them. The people plant flowers in. Me? and that guy was coming up here and tell me I've got full of luck that I had to get rid of. Come on man, that was my flyer pots, I don't get rid of what you got to take. So that's the police. So that's clutter and up your drain. I don't hear it's my ground, my property, my footer, the eye clutter. You stay out, that side of the pizza. You shut up, lay my lounge. So just hold on fellas again in the undying room. Is there any rate of maximum power on the website? So if that guy was going to duke you can pick their phone there... But if a guy was necessary, he is gonna pick them up more... Using his phone scan with a phone camera screen to drop them, people have so little. They're naturally kind of attacking the home. Talking to Charles Sutter, it's hard not to wonder if any couldn't have just presented suggest. One more people wrote, because if you ask Charles to pay what changes they to say, the list actually matches a lot of things on cancer. They need somebody to keep these roads in shape. They need a trash truck, the pick to trash up. I'm not a drugstore, you hear? I don't know if they still works. Game run for me, too. A typical mayor of a Dutch town, brings out 50, maybe 60 votes. This one turned into a referendum on the report. I've even felt so strong, nearly 200 votes. And he got 89. It's a pound. Current mayor of Charles Joyce. Thank you. Any thoughts? Thank you. Big four acres outside. Just a little bit of time. Last up in the years, every since the starting day of his life, Ravana, Ravana, Ravana. The great job is to strange, he works for companies that do disaster, tend to immerse in her heat, or pressure with her. Though, he just calls herself a culture. The vice-president of the club, is called five, six months, seven days of 12 hours, makes a lot of money. It comes out, it's months later. Area November and September, by my butt blue to TV sets. other children watching bird heard you. That's the, this is a job. It's very cute people who this one face you. It's an outside artist who's observed now with her deck. Rick has an entire theory on the townworks. Why can't he inject him? Downtown this used to be, well, this town used to thrive in party mortals fights. up to the middle mid-six and just  everything else  it was a railroad down. Railroad closed down so the cotton mills closed down, cotton mills closed down, no jobs, people left the jobs, businesses that have people running, people who are people who are going to need to tap businesses, businesses closed, all that, you have a ghost, just typical ghost answer. now what you got left here. the die hearts people that just won't move out because they don't they're afraid to go anywhere else and for to go anywhere else and you know they keep them at a poverty level  people down here they don't make any month that's my big bitch about jobs they got down here for a six seven dollars an hour or jobs on these to make 15 12 15 home that's so yeah this is  goddamn don't group I go home I make 1450 I've made a size 17 now This is a common screen filled with a sprinkle dog now here's $7 an hour in the expect beyond calls 17 days week 24 hours a day They don't want to pay up any kind of an overtime situation they just want to hand you pay check They just got this attitude  they only they're doing you a large thing I got some, , I personally got some really bad news for him, so no faith. Most of these people are in this town have been in this town. So they figure they're here. What they got, what they're doing again, they just hit the crust, upset, aggravated, look around, and how? Some people don't try to fix things, they'll make their lives bad. People give them up. And they stay with us cheap. Rick's property taxes. and the other seven powers of year. Picture that into the setting, come Kenny and Jackie Gord, people from another America, and America people on the go, sell help set in the motivational studios, Jackie used to be the professionals. Jackie and Kenny arrived in the, and it was , who is two different visions, what it means to live in this country, is can now a little small town, people apply, suffer alliance, neighbors, band gathered that civic institutions. Risk to narrow up. place for the people, they simply cannot get it together. I say once we insurers, this can be nice, be able to go out the yards, in a summer time and not a smell, somebody's sipped. Or look out across somebody's yard after rain, and I'll see black water once. Did it? It's. But they're so scared. Well I guess it's because they don't have them. , they're so scared, this is going on. , cost, mayer thing they got, they don't want them to do. And so, they came to pass. But in this town where people do not want to clean their arms, we know what it wants to be bought, democratic process work pretty much as well as we can imagine. The mayor they chose instead of kennel is in a certain sense, perfect sense of people. One of the biggest and junkiest people in town is mayor. Discibe with the senses. Will? Really keen. That sounds sh**. show it to you. We walked to it exactly. There are two houses, right? There are two houses there. All it pipe and stuff. Oh, they're on ground. That's it. Did you say pipes each one, , wrong-gid car on foot? That's your irrigation pipe. That's your, yeah. That's part. That's one line. That's good. Big loss. It's where he's all. He got all kinds of junk farm equipment, trucks, factory trailers. So, my, , who's in the yard? That was my roof, my own death. They were pretty well-known, what's going on here. Charles Joyce is such a successful politician that he does not actually remember how many times he's been real  since the early 1980s. But I visit it's just before dinner. He's a farmer in his sixties, sat on a couch and he's small-ish with you. TV pray. little TV-trade as next we discussed. I've been warned by the gossip line, and we've got Mr. Joyce at somehow obscended beautiful cypress floors, the old-genese immigrants brought down and used them for his own living room. This was nowhere near a true. If any, now those down two-porting seats still firm.

That is money they do not have, but clean up, who do not want to. Say, what's junk? To me, maybe your treasure is a, there's a couple of old here, and I'm still stalled, we haven't been able to burst in the backyard. That's all the story building me. got that bus with prototype on. Check it on blocks. And then not really bothered me. Don't hear it properly. See, one outside, we've made one out of this. And this is one of the few things that probably is the way we got. We don't have much of the unstarantry person out here. and we're not actually a thing that... I don't know more work,  here. They were not right here taking those who are just being said real close. That was only toys that they don't have. Broken toys just sitting out the yard. Yeah. They were at the yard, because that's where the pipe was in the yard. While the toys were broke, that there's a nice toys piece. But when you get really any one hand that it always does. I don't agree. I don't agree. I've been away from my youth for a few months. Are people do  it here? When night I stopped my rents when I was quite fond of the 13 year old nephew Jason there. I'd be interested to do the snider was there, Mary Wiltonberg, and we were away last month in the Southamouths. We all talked for a long time. It was fun. I'd be able to talk about my mom and I could stay there after I pack off. Jason did his impressions for us. and then gave us permission to broadcast. They fact which will surely horrify you for your submission now. Please surprise me. Be today's adventurer. Harder not sleep over. You got some sleep late. Wow, sit down my garage one day. Mmmhmm. I'm on the screen and so I walked down there and I saw that casually. And I caught a sling lid, so I picked it up. Mmmhmm. Of course, gum. I'm a little rusted. I'm a little rusted. Hi. I don't even score a score. It's going to hope. People call me. It's going to hope. I did not. Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! That that that that saw I got to say about that Rick T. Slevana about canal with town that she made a moved People here fighting modernization themselves just last night. Oh, they are not get up in that The NASCAR the question that Rick says he's been asking for eat years since they got married Why did she want to stay in canal? Ha ha ha ha ha. He's gonna ask me that honest to God. I don't know why there's nothing reason to live here except for if you've got friends or relatives. Well it's  well I live across the street of that big fort tap there every morning. I just love that porch. You're , go outside drinking coffee and I dream about when I grow old, sitting on a porch with my buddy, my buddy lives across the street. You're sitting on a porch just ... and  and it goes to the office and it goes to the office and then  not me nasty things just boring old I don't you see what she did in her hair  just  that I love that house boy songs  that but to me  that's just one of my my dreams is just a set in grow-all with my friends In a various projects to improve the knowledge, Jackie had a success in his values. Big success is necessary to came to the last 30 years. Ladies are exhilarating through a big fourth of July cookout, but actually through a crop, the booze and games, paintings of the little kids, fireworks display and everybody said is even better than sights, crunchy western events, the adults, some people even dance. Only problem was, most of the clouds were smiling, perhaps only a third now. win meaning a chance was. We'll let these auxiliary hodocostos protest with the mean heroes, the Garland Fire. Final, 80, 50 or 60 people from the In and Out, people of all ages. And that, to make us the most hard ones, is all that. It would say, the whole difference between people and them. And there's something that I'm on. After that party, Jackie finally felt tough going up in terror to start going church in Canale. Everyone then started telling me they appreciate what the 80s. I'm so excited to see what you're doing. This is also doing the career of the candidates on a career, on a good and good job. I'm talking face to face, love people were encouraging. Thought he was a shooter. I was state-of-the-art, I was feeling  my vocabulary, this is everything that's not a word. I wanted to make the communities come together. And what's the... And then we started getting friends, calls, and we thought it was that out of the box. Leave this time. and we don't want you here, you're not wanting to eat. People who ate in bottles of house, threatening phone calls, some people who avoided the monochrome. One day the car went to the school. And then, in a damn December, we were shot in, okay? The detective's out of Jeff said he said it wasn't kids that moved shot in from top school with rifle. And he came to our bedroom. Wow. Jackie showed me the bullet. We're gonna find it. Time is so strange. Jackie and Kenny are not sure what somebody would be shot at them. At that point, right? Maybe Jackie. Somebody saw that they were finally having success. Just couldn't stay in. In any case, the bullets. That's just not more. Jackie had hopes to build it back and get some of them. he waived me to turn off  tears and tears. She made out of the room to get some tissues. Hang back. Took him in and then let me turn the table back on. That's the first time. That's the first time I've heard him. I is really sad if he did this. The two of you must have talked that to each of you. Oh yes, yeah, I've said I'm through, I can't take anymore of and then I say oh well maybe this project make this, we've had three pretty rough years here, what we've been doing. Just a people business, and it's hard to accept, not a. When you're not wanting to start writing, it's really hard to give into you. Can he have never actually said to her before this moment? He was ready to move away. You need to stress no good deed goes and punish me. What? No good deed goes and punish you. It's well, probably not. But anyway, maybe we are not said we are dead, we think. We're not putting on the rules. Maybe it's more of what we were in hot days. I get it when I'm quiet, I have to just wait for something. And it'll be this way, actually. Not a good pen and pen. You have to have a vision of where it is possible. There is a ruthless change in one. Too close in the way of what works. In the danger of having a vision of course, is that you're visioned from cloud rise, that was real fair. Often when I talk to Jackie, I'm struck at her vision. I've held live for past-west. People stayed in town for 40 years, saw a change from what it was, back then, what it is now. But without the advantage of watching the daily erosion, Jackie can still see it as it was. When she talked about it, it was always a version of the past, but at the quality of the fairy tale, something barely sunny. One day I was walking through an old-banded house and the town was westside. One of the buildings the kids called the club houses. The room was spoken through the floor's corner, the boss crime bed. Jason, good to be honest. Look me there. There's lumber everywhere, insulation from the ceiling. And then there's a rope where she used to be. And they nailed the rope here, which is not everyone's walking on the wall. That was safe. We can do , whatever we can find out here's what we do. It's not much. The day after Jason and I was driving by this very house, Kenny and Jackie Fort. When Jackie looks at this house, she doesn't just see a dangerous wreck of a place that she thinks she'll be torn down right now and here and now. She has to seize what it was. Back when? -huh. Her school teacher. I will make the one. I remember her. She had a lot of dollies, white, starged, crochet, dollies,  riding the middle of her coffin table and riding the middle of that ship, came to me and she would always off and work this time. And you were a lab, and I take it at the office and then that was the main thing and she had a glass, a slipper, ordinary person. She did I used to just love to work it. Some of her have one of the light-cancers bedroom, one day we did this glass slipper and it was the shimmer. and I thought probably it's made of diamonds. Yeah, she's probably the richest lady of time. I don't know about it. It's the priority of Jackie's vision. The vision of the town that was, the town that seemed to be a trend, she was scared. But by with her sheer willfulness, her effectiveness, making things happen. This is the combination that Perner has found the path that takes for these last three years. Something now, a rifle shot, brighter to the different, what can happen to us. Second, you're a place that personally which is starting. Something that, you may have heard in the past, a group. Oh God, say to Abraham, kill me a son. Hey, say to many must be putting me on. God said no, they'd say what? God said you can do what you want if, but the next time you see me coming you better run. Well, let's hear it! He walked this killing gun, got down on highway 61. Coming up, due good news with million dollars a day and their pockets to spend, playing tickets overseas, that's the minute the public radio international, we're not programmed continues. To America live for my request, each week in a program of course was a theme being a variety of stories in that theme today's program. Do gooders why they often fail, but sometimes it's a seed. We've arrived in actual robots. program at two humanitarians. In 1994, in the African country of Wanda, who took up a minute-structed its people, to go out and fill their neighbors, her workers, friends, and several church members would have to be too sick. At least 800,000 people were murdered. Although there were several different moments but international action could conceive of the stop or slow-decenting world did nothing. How back, in fact, various points by the United States government. But after the biggest part of the genocide in ethnicity the community did finally at the full of grave which is written about all this in the spoke. We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families' stories. Finally the killing was brought to a halt by a rebel army within Rwanda and the command that had been going out over the government radio to the Huchu majority had been previously killed all the turtis joined in the killing. Now it was flee, joined in the Exodus and really close to a million and a half or two million. people fled Rwanda in the largest fastest mass-exodus in modern recorded history across the borders into Tanzania but primarily also into the what was then Zayir, the Congo, under Mubu-Tube and this enormous outbrush of people was perceived broadly as an Exodus from the genocide. In other words, we in the world beyond, it been told my goodness, there's a lot of the war of 152, when it comes to 2027, and when it comes to Messever the other murder, and  we're+,  we explore and hide all our sufferings of cutoffing studies, they're making a mess. going on inside the water and then we're told there are a lot of people fleeing and the obvious assumption was that these people must in some way be fleeing the atrocities in fact the these people were potential victims. In some sense that they were victims by virtue of displacement the image of a refugee is the image of a victim. And many of the people who were fleeing were people who were essentially civilians caught up in the turmoil and displacement of this conflict. On the other hand it very great man left them were also people who had been active as either ordinary killers as they're called in Rwanda, or as the organizers of the killers, the militia, the military, the civic leaders, the church leaders, the school teachers, and doctors, and so forth, the so-called intellectuals, who presided over the population when it was at home, and who essentially were leading this population into acts out to create a Rwanda-genicidal state. It was then that you had this incredibly large humanitarian influx into the Congo in particular and to say here, particularly into the towns of Gohmet and McCott, with the border towns as fast air lifts and enormous outpouring of international aid went to establish massive refugee camps in essentially catered to this huge refugee hotpot. And some of the organizations that were going in at that point in the thinking one point you say was a million dollars. day that was being spent. At that point it was much more than a million dollars a day. A million dollars a day was what it came to be averaged out as over a three year period. So you can imagine that at that point when they were bringing in transport planes around the clock they were literally transport planes were touched on this runway, got the back door and fleets of white land cruisers with poor out with aid workers. They were bringing in water sanitation and vast plumbing systems. They were bringing in every known kind of engineering sanitation engineer from all of the are guys are being abandoned through their home…! And this is the International Red Cross, some of the other groups. Literally, literally there were scores perhaps more than a hundred private organizations. There were many smaller Christian organizations and church-based organizations. You had Carrie Tass from six or seven different countries. You had World Vision. They all come in with their flags. It was a traffic jam. One of the things you write is a very quickly-to-power which had conducted the genocide took over the camps and died. He established it. So, well, that's the terrible thing. This, what appeared to be a humanitarian disaster was of course really a political disaster. It was the consequences of a government that had sought to exterminate much of its people and that government. Fled, and presided over the camps, the same civic structures and political structures, immediately replicated themselves and there was enormous violence in the camps very quickly. These camps were set up with an amylavor-rewan, so they were  terrorist bases right on the border, and in fact that the Huita Palace were staging raids from this base. Regularly, there was killing going on, wherever there were camps, there was a very, very high murder raids surrounded them. Basically, murder by the same militias had carried up the genocide. It was a really quiet experience. drug-marry, brilliant, public relations move, frankly, by which the forces that had committed genocide almost immediately that they finished killing, managed to convert themselves into public imagination into the victims of the task of it. By becoming refugees, by exploiting our generosity with humanitarian aid, and by basically buffalowing our imaginations to the degree that we sort of just imagine, although... for people. We're giving them help. Thank goodness we're doing something. And the terrible thing I got on our was whenever I'd go to visit these camps, I meet people who were more  me, which is to say, I'll educate it, Western, nice European and American and North American. And then women in their 20s who came over. Basically with the idea, I will do something that is simple and straightforward and good. Right, there will be suffering. I will learn how to get green water to these people, how to dull out food to these people, how to help them dig trenches to dispose of their waste in a way that's safe for them. I will do good. It will be on ambiguous. And I will get some satisfaction from that. And I will also feel  I'm not a passive witness to the horrors of the world. And in fact, what they were doing is they were catering. the horrors of the world. There's a place on a page 166 in the book, in the package of the week. In this regime, the humanitarian switch read it rather  the service staff at a C, Mafia Occupy Hotel. They were there to provide food, medicine, housewares, and aura of respectability. For the times they were panned. to, who was only because they were being set up to be cheated. If they needed to be proud beaten, I'm awkwardly surrounded them. And if they were essentially the dups, their criminal gasses, they were not unwitting about it. And with time, their service effectively made them accessories to the Houtu power syndicates. And essentially, they were keeping the whole thing going by, by, by, by, by, crowding food and, , it's not that poor to count. Through that entire period, it was this really self-evident thing that, as long as those camps existed. There was an F. for the militias in the camps by the who-to-power militias in the camps who wanted to start to ethnically cleanse regions around the camps. In case one day those camps were closed they could create a rear base. So they started massacring people in the mountains. They started massacring people in their host countries. It created tremendous turmoil. And there was a complete unwillingness to confront. And sometimes they would say, well, ,  a doctor who takes him both to treat somebody, whether he's a murderer or a good man, we too operate on the principle that one should give age to people and leave the political questions to political people. But there's a very big difference between neutrality and ignorance. And it's one thing to say, well, I'm going to feed this guy even if somebody else tells me he's criminal because my job is simply to feed people. It's another to say, I don't want to know that he's a murderer because that in some way teens my experience here. And I found that that was quite often what I heard. That was very disturbing. And then your book you also talk about ordinary Rewondens who try to help out and say people in ways that they can. And one of the people who you talk about is the manager of a hotel named Amatrak And that's the same part, recessa begina. Yeah. In Kigali, there's one basically world-class hotel in the sort of best hotel in town. The hotel they milk a lean. And it turned out to Paul, who had been put in charge of the hotel, had used all of his considerable human resources, as well as his liquor cabinet, and all of his connections to the ruling, military and political elite, to continuously buy the security of the city. his guests first longest he could until eventually they were saved by a prisoner's change. The way he'd describe him, he comes off  Humphrey Bogart in Tassel Blanca. He was a very reserved man, , he, , but one of the things he tells you is that one of his main weapons is that he always had alcohol, no matter how long he'd be the crisis it was, he saw that they had alcohol on the hotel and that was everybody wanted it, , he could, , he would serve the, the Huchu leaders, he would apparently would drive people when he needed to. How many of you described how he would give out these gifts about the Hall to people who would come by and in that way they would be almost  it was the goose with the golden egg. You didn't want to kill him because then the supply would dry up. He'd set up a whole elaborate commerce. So the leaders would come to the hotel and he'd give them a little bit to drink and his condition was, , you leave my hotel alone. And he'd go to the things he wanted. He also used alcohol to buy food so that his people would start the water and then cut to the hotel. and the gas were forced to drink the swimming pool. But he managed to keep them going. He discovered a number of times when the phone rings, I'll take one of the gore of phone rings and wakes him up. And the lieutenant says to him, , have everyone out of the hotel on 30 minutes to be grounded up. Yeah, he was, this was about 630 in the morning one day. And he's been told to relinquish all of the gas. And it's hotel on many ways, it's principal, well, it's that of a, of a, of a. man who believed in the theatrical hospitality. Where are my guests? I must protect you. You told this lieutenant look. Give me half an hour to get up and get washed up. I'll deal with you then. And in a half hour, one thing that he had was one of his weapons was a phone line. And he used it to call all of the world. And he immediately called to Europe, he called to the French Foreign Ministry. Now, France was the primary political patron of the genocide of Regime at that time. He called the Ernie Stoke. People there, he called Beld. with in about 25 minutes one of the top commanders of the military in other with this lieutenant superior and also somebody from the U.N. showed up at the hotel and they came in the assurances that his guests would be okay no foreign lives were risked this wasn't the massive military intervention of lives we say a lot of times the kind of the kind measure it will just the smallest human sort of response. There's this is story that you write about where this Protonmanager Paul in the middle of May sort of the worst of days He is out when Narens trying to get alcohol for hotel and he comes back to the hotel and he and sees that the end of a Homway have broken the thoughts broken in and they're trying to the working person family the going to his own personal apartment And and explain how he how he to chose them what happened? Well, he realized that these who's a pretty uneducated I wasn't that and he ran into some of them on the stairs and he was dressed in t-shirt jeans or something. And they probably realized that they must assume that a manager would be a man the necktie or a suit. So when they said if you see the manager, he said, oh yeah the manager, he just went that way. And it was really almost  a classic Hollywood gag. He said, , he just went upstairs. He ran downstairs and he's running downstairs. He runs into another group. and he tells them the manager must have gone the other way. So they're all, he sends them all off spiral in different directions. And that's what saves you off. Yeah, the most basic immediate way to do it, but the sense, I think the key to Paul in some ways was, it was his instinct that everything is negotiation. It struck me how in some very basic way, he simply refused to relinquish free well. and we link with judgment, which I think is the part that ties into these other humanitarian to think that in the name of neutrality and humanitarianists have to link with judgment. He thought that it was because of judgment that he could be at least mad. It's interesting that people who tend to come through well and book  people who are , they're pragmatists, they're not idealists. Many of the dooders I met, many of the people I felt to you in one way or another, not represented by any code and fate as an automatic politician. This ethic, that is risky. By itself, what the change your mind is from Ray, this was pull-up, conducted themselves well in these extraordinary times of experimenting. We're both pragmatic and shockable. They still remained sort of indignant at law doing. They were not deeply cynical. And they thought that making distinctions really matter. They were people. people who simply insist on going on is of the world. We're upright and normal. And in that way, they help to make sure that it would be. As you watch, as you watch the United States mobile as itself, human's bombings of course of all, what are you thinking as you see that, given the US in action during genocide and the war. I think that's- Sadly, the situation in Kosovo reflects the kind of institutionalization and vastedization of the concept of humanitarian action that we saw in a very different form in the response to the refugee camps after the war on the genocide. We are claiming that we are bombing Yugoslavia as a humanitarian action, but it's not a war, we're fighting against harming. we're trying to destroy an army. We are, if our first objective was really as we claim in the first week of this war to protect people of Kosovo, it's clear that we've actually put them in greater jeopardy at first that their protection isn't the issue. And the language of humanitarianism has increasingly become a mask-raid for a variety of different forms of action or inaction in the international community to disguise political conflicts. As if our only concern. with for the loss of human life. And in that way, we end up with a series of muddled discourses and muddled motives that make it sound , if we're doing it, it must be good. And often make it very hard for us to keep track of what impact we are doing. The other thing that we'll just test to look at is how completely calculating the characters that we've got to work these days are. The reason I think I was going to say is one of the things that comes through in the book is that the Huchun Malusha, who in the camps were very cany about exploiting Western attitudes, exploits them. Absolutely. If I were right now trying to run a good insurrection somewhere in the world, the first thing I would do is I would appoint a commander or minister or general and charge of humanitarian manipulation. Look at how it was used in the Yugoslop conflict. during the Bosing War. You repeatedly saw, safe havens being created, Jen will's using them to curtail people and then going in and slaughtering them knowing that the UN wouldn't defend them. And then in many ways, I think, this isn't always the humanitarian fault. I think that the political decision makers, the policymakers, leaders who can doctor our foreign policy. UN often use you manage area in a, to hide behind the use of as a screen to mask the alone in decision and their own unwell in this act. And it's essentially a way of making the gestures and concern without really seeking to resolve in any meaningful way. Castery. So the great great book is cut.
