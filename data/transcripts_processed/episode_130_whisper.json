Many months, it was tired, so I started living in the same place. It turned into a swing there in justice. Thanks. For his ancestors and his dog. in the mind and in the eyes of black Americans it's not a horrible thing to say because it's what it sounds  is I just said I'm grateful for my life which is not the case of what it says to me is that grateful for grateful for being alive and if I haven't grown in black Americans and I don't know if I've got a tree in place to be able to have to be in the same You think this is certain amount of pressure on black Americans to embrace Africa as a home? Yeah, and it's all around. You're supposed to have black persons told us black people are smart, and embrace Africa as your home, even though most of them are most black Americans.

And I said well no, he said but  now that you mentioned it my parents were both Jewish then they both became Catholic and when I said that he looked at me  I was free There's some of these those very relaxed spam. And we were hanging out in this place where I had no idea why I was there, what I was doing there. And I started playing piano, playing play and they sang, I play, they sang. And they said, well, you should play the piano  you're Jewish. And I said, is that a good thing you're bad? So, where I sit? , that's a good thing. And I felt this connection with Irving's family . I kind of never felt before. It was a level of comfort that was very odd. I mean, for me to be a kind of weird, shite teenager in a place that I was uncomfortable with with people I'd never met, to be relaxed enough to hang out all night and play the piano with them, sing songs that were essentially silly. Yeah, there was kind of this level of relaxation that went beyond. It's  what you want your family to be. I think there was something that I'm scared to call it genetic and it's obviously something more than some kind of cultural fingerprint. But there was something in the way that Irving kind of looked at the world and people in it. And it was a manner about him that... that relaxed my genes a little bit. , and it's one of those inexplicable things that is very real. , it's  love, I guess, right? You can't define it and you can't bottle it and you can't turn it into equation, but  how much it either hurts or makes you feel good. And this was exactly ... This is precisely the sort of not easy to explain to. the change to the size and the change to students later he will baton it is the turning point to let him to converting to Judaism which means he is trying to next to him. A Hungarian Germans who was passing through the stairs close about this one and when I went to the table for the current Chicago video and his workbook games cannot play him on. The stories about two people had exactly the same kind of irrational moment of recognition the student government's means. The sympathies cited it but they had more empowerment in each other. and either one of them has any names. Story begins with woman named Ida who was born in Poland during the Second World to reduce her. When the Nazis invaded Poland and started shipping Jews off the classification camps, she was separated from the family, including from her twin brother, a model. Christian family took her in and attended that she was there a child, and it's a last report, when a father attracted down the street room. The search for the rest of her family, but they never found her. And long after she moved to the United States, she called the.. I didn't get over the feeling that her twin brother was still alive. After, someone. She found that she was always thinking, imagining what she would say to him, which is all I'm saying. She was kind of  a potion. Whenever I went to another city or another country, the first thing I would do is pick up the telafondic and search for his name. Faluk had no luck. They were Faluk, but they were not Jewish or another country they were maybe Italian or whatever either they went. I looked in the fall of the moon. I was looking for a family almost in the fall of the night. By the search engine, there was man in Paulham named Jersey Dolabstein, who grew up in a Christian family. He never felt right in his family. This is parents never shed any affection you gave to the rather church. I got a story from Gary and James, I was thinking, what do I think? Because I saw other kids they are kissing playpad. and they work in some way together. I never. My responsibility was only clean yards around the club. Clean shows for every party. See, you're really practicing? My polish parents took me there. My interpreter made this story where best. And the time jersey was 12. His polish parents decided to send him to an orphanage. His German education galleryronics. because they didn't have enough money to keep me home, but Jersey noticed they didn't send their other children away, and he concluded that he must be adopted, his post-family denied it for years, and finally admitted it. So, as a teenager, Jersey started to work for his real family, contacted a Jewish organization following him, but they turned him away, they told me he wasn't Jewish. And what finally ended his search, and brought these two people together, Jersey and Twitter. Instagram. One Twitter that happened to be published in there. One. day because 1995 my girlfriend sent me this article from Connecticut from Jewish letter and she inscribed on top of it that you might find it very interesting and in the article there was description of Jewish Holocaust children survivors and the picture of a building man who kind of took me into a little when I looked at him because he looked  my grandfather. So I was in shock few months and finally one day I decided I must listen about it. I wrote today a reporter of that Jewish legend in when I found her I asked about this an individual in the following. What she said actually he does not remember much from this chat. I don't remember anything from work. Need to write a blank song. Write a thousand pages. And I thought many times that the reason I do not kill from my brothers, Khababuki does not come in. Oh. Oh. And I decided I'm going to get in touch with you. So I'm doing it. 19.95 times. In the said, why do you think I am your brother? You play with a mother. When were you born? I was born in 1939. So kids are not human at my sister. I was born October 1542. How do ? For sure. Because my Christian birth certificate says, So I took a breath, night-balling, guess what? I pushed in towards certificate. it says the same thing that I was born in 1930 too. So there are discrepancies here because we had false papers. So I told very very strong about it and I said, my dad, how am I going to convince him that this is my graph? Because you're sure my instinct all in my everything. I was already sure. And, I ask him, will you remember anything from the test empty? He says, I also first time that I did not remember, but now I know that I remember one thing. When I was taking my Polish poster clearance after the war I was praying. something that they reminded me all the time. I was saying that help. Amen, Daddy. in Mr. Lyon. In I said,  who is Mr. Lyon? So, , so that's the name of our heart. You are praying for your heart. You're denying this thing. , I was married. I married my wife in 1960. And, well, I saw this. Why? itself Bitch, I decide. G I don't know why, in iphone's system. She sent me the chat right now, missing here. My wife, looks familiar, very familiar. And I didn't, , wake up,  wake up, I remember this. Since that time when we both established the various possibilities are twins, I cried every day for any little thing for a sense including past grade 4 The intimacy I wanted to hear from all the time I wanted to talk to him He seemed We had  a Teller Kind of in fact, yeah right whenever I thought about him to work on And In the beginning he called me once in two weeks and he called me every week and toward the end we called me five seconds It was not enough Still there was no concrete evidence they were brought in system and nothing in the official paper trust just they were very Riled shelter called them Mead magic leaves So final date that we established that I'm going to go to Parliament April 28, in 2005 and we met in the worst airport. The first time, and I mean, it was  a nightmare from all the people that stood there. I knew which one is next to. On my brother also brought some people from Polish television to record this moment of us meeting. So there were cameras, and we felt  celebrities. Wasn't him, private seat. Wasn't. Was that too bad? Was a little strange but I just see my brother, nobody else, just in the middle of what happened. And people were standing around and crying, not knowing actually why we are crying. The first night, our life together, we slept in one room. in one woman who is tempted to see say so. I asked her when  whether or they this with the sun because for two, for two days I don't know whether because I never cared from my position. We were seeing a lot about two kittens,   twins. How do a special stay in Poland just two weeks? It's weeks between Poland. They just could stand in between seven of them. In Jersey, the set changes in Adam Powell. The name I'm talking, he had been born. He was born, Stanley, and Stanley, and he was just born. It's  30 years, and they were struggling. It started to come in, and then we started to get... Now this was an extendable for me. I heard her hand, you walked on the street with her and I looked up all that in the first, I had not time for my wife. me and my sister we have, , so much information to you said in Cheeves  chance. We might write for sleep. That's done quiet! to go to work without the system, , hand in hand. And in 10 because people started to talk with another woman, nobody knows this year. And I don't fight with a sister because you lose. The family did not respond the way he had said. The night came, I was the proof. that he used to, and they did not want anybody involved, , they called us not to advertise the world. When I was about to leave Paul and people needed to be , to meet my family and I wanted to meet my family. So he came to us at tourist, they've used up a few months, and once again. with me to shithag on. Every time we told about the separation it's harder to talk and, or unfortunately, he's family that pull it, it's why he's children. They start calling in the staff, talking to him, his wife wouldn't come to the telephone when he told her. Who said Allah Butte? I still didn't have a feeling of warmth. It's very good going to ask me, my family was surprised, felt  they were using me, what's happening to me, all parts somewhere else. They were not ready. I was strange, , and today they cry, because they understand how we... in which way I was a brother. Because they were hard even my daughter called me that I am neglecting her grandchildren. Her children because of my brother. verändert olan they shall unto me movie about our, mute loyalty to word my life, and be a different opinion I am plaisir. because I leave my family now. They want to let the family the bad guy. They take them sick. They maybe was prepared to  that. Or this doll is trapped in a shit. He's just a filthy little doll. This is a true Jew. That's why he left his wife. They didn't make him welcome anymore. That's the first I heard after a movie of British. Adam said, Stan and Malcolm, he parted for us. He's struggling his marriage for years and he moved in the time of two years, and he'd done the street food, he took English classes. Getting a green card and stiff at home. I'd wrote letters to kinds of people in Russian for sure, so anybody should think that. And this is the fight about for me about almost years. This was really fighting. She lost two times a year. Then, with water. But I couldn't concentrate anymore and anything. Just, , I wanted him to stay and... I felt very, , to be changed in  another... I had this... I mean, everybody would call each other and now that he lives in his own apartment, he's still seeing each other. almost everyday. It's very strange back to the... She cut me and get it and say, I love it. Yes, it's nice. Two different handsys? Yeah! I'd  to add them. I'll record an avant-garde story after story  this. Coincidence is the proof that in some way that they must be brought in this story. Even in a hard proof sense. The family's brother actually did it. DNA test, but they refuse. Then they don't need food. Just no. There's an uncanny quality in the fallen world, and there's an uncanny quality in the fallen world. And it's some level. What is this? What makes no people at home? Back at the physical. You mentioned that you're two people feeling close to each other. Weird cookies. So if you happen to have a DNA test tomorrow, which route would prove that you're not systeming, how would you feel after those tests? Let me know. And DNA test was already thrown in our face as many times, which in the beginning have said there's not any more, we don't want it to prove to any type. anything we just put each up and that's enough for us. And Ray, it seemed that you were absolutely sure all you wanted very badly, very much to believe. I saw the first time on every airport my doubts go out, go out, go out, go out. You need it. You don't really take up the way, Chara. You said that. copy and on side of side and I'm copy of another side. When I was in toilet, I decided I did not do an implant. And I told to miss out. If you need me to tell you close below, it's better. I believe in God. I don't need DNA. Yes. I believe in God. I don't need DNA. Yes. I believe in God. I don't need DNA. Yes. because I believe what happened to us is it has the hand of a higher power. People who are not touched by Holocaust, they don't understand Holocaust survivors, whatever little thing means to us. To some it might be an important nothing to think about twice. and to ask are very important things because they look for every little piece of evidence. I already sister in brother when we call up a sewer biobbs. And the same test, we understand each other very well not only me and Adam but all the people who are in our group of hidden children and call up a sewer and survivors.
