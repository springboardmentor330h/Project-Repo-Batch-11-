Wait, no, you just know as the city person who is urban homeowner. , the farm person you haven't used is just thinking you can hire a tiny farm in town, you are so. A lot of these conversations have to do with animals and their deaths. Take this step. The woman who runs the website for our radio show was with myster. There's a piano exhibition, right? by the American poultry association in Columbus, Ohio, and here's to you, she's standing in a room with 12,000 chickens. And she gets into this conversation with an American York girl. I've only been in poultry in Waterpile for a year. I'm learning to waterpile. This is to make the overs from Bliss, New York, who is at the convention to show some of Iran birds. So, city fronts? The groups that do anything to stay in the sea? Do you have some huge chickens itself? No, because they have a lot of people show their lives. Maybe show it, kids or cows, or rabbits, just  that. A lot of people are school-shown, everything. You make one of Elizabeth's talk for a while. And then Elizabeth tried. Very, very gentle. Yes, the question that was on her mind. Do you, , this is a, , hard question. Yeah, ask. Do you remember? Yeah, yeah. And this makes me really sad when I need you to do raises chickens for  a whole full check. Yeah, we hatch him out and then... Yep. We get a break from the anime. We eat them with a lot. We do raise a lot for feeding. And so, so when you're just, when you're going to put it up this chicken, , the you raise the chicken, you feel a little bit guilty, you're eating this pickle. No, so... Do it, do you ever eat the chicken soup, shall? If the Nugger for show with the losers, yeah! Miko is on trouble with this. For both has bad feathers, a lot of sighted comb. It might be a nice bird, but it's not going to win competitions, you eat it. That's . Those of us who do not live on farms, we divide animals off those who go up and those we eat. If you make those world, there's not such a hard line separating. to get to know a bird on up close in one-one basis, and still eat it. An animal's transition from bloody to dinner. This great deal less problematic than this for a city folks. Welcome to WB EZ Chicago, Public Radio International. It's a American life on my right glass. And every year, during the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. The highest poultry consumption time of the year in the United States. We bring you a program about poultry, or annual poultry slam. Stories of chickens, turkey, ducks, birds of all kinds, and our relationships with them. In past years, we have brought you an opera about the life of chicken, little. We brought you the story of a hand puppet duck that would not lead people's lives. And actually we brought you real stories of actually growing up with turkey and chickens and other birds. And in putting it at this year. show. Very few particular ideas and questions get coming up in story after story, without us ever intended for it to happen this life. A lot this year's show has turned to a kind of record random about where you draw the clock between friends and food. At one of today's program, still light with chicken, food writer Jonathan Gold's house was what it's  to hand fry a chicken with a live chicken watching you in a entire time. Back to last meal. When Francois Mieteraw knew he was about to die, he decided that the last food processed lips would be poultry. Tiny bird that is actually illegal to eat in France, a bird that buy tradition is eaten with a napkin covering your head. Michael Padre did not even set up for France to try to contraband Cape Han himself. That's what we report. That great. People who love chickens and hate this American wife. Last year. Omen and Karen Davis started a national letter-writing campaign to try to get this American light to stop the very program you are listening to at this very moment. The annual poultry slam. In this portion of our show she explains, what it is that we just do not understand about poultry. That why the whole idea of this poultry show was wrong headed from the start. At four, meaning of a bird, David Rackoff explains how this light was changed in a single evening. 5000 chickens. Say what this is. That one still life was chicken. It was an accident to Jonathan ended up living chicken. He was not living the kind of lifestyle that one usually associates the chicken. This was during the period when I considered myself to be a performance artist. It was naked performance artist in the city. These days, Jonathan Goldis, Food Rider and Los Angeles. So I'll have him 15 years ago. He was going to get a performance. He added PS system which could have be represented amount of no-8 feedbacks and high decibels. He had the two full bottles, Glade, American Beauty, Arrow fresher, which he would spray in their entirety in the eastern states. And he had a live chicken, which he bought today before the performance, one of those Chinese poultry markets in Los Angeles. And come today at the show, an audience gatherers in the darkened warehouse in West LA. I did not think there was a lot of performance. I'm sorry for this was sort of really difficult of this stuff that was pouring in more of it. And I showed up and I was making it and I was carrying a machete in that line. And I stood in the middle of this pile of super market check. , the boiler's in the pot. And the chicken that I bought was Tethered to a three-foot rope around me. And I had to open down blindly with the shed. toward the chicken or just in general. Well, I was blindfolded, so I didn't often was toward the chicken or not. And I had fully intended that in fact I would kill each other. But chickens aren't that stupid. And this chicken wanted no part of the shit, stayed at the end of the broken tire time. Then they're kicking hands after. 10 minutes, let's completely exhaust the right Delta V and everybody's left. I don't know if you've stuck around after our performance, but the few minutes after our performance are the some of the most depressing in the world. Pass up. You've done your wad, you've done your sort of bit for art, you should see the worker but you're sitting there, you're... covered with chicken fluency in my day and it stinks to high health. Everybody's car and you got to clean up and donated. It's really not a pretty good. So Jonathan cleaned up and when he was done he had a chick and he didn't feel he could put his animal tail back into the bathroom, ant Unbelievable并 So Richard, преступiac brought him together, But  he could not get stuck. This is what the Sims of the Kitten shows up. Back to work. Scratch. Well, need. So we took the chicken. And in doing that, he stumbled across that in and off. That separates food items in the one. From pets. That divides the animals with the animals. So I get home and I have this chicken and I don't know what to do with it. So I spread out some juice. on top of my refrigerator. And I put the chicken on, I get a can of green giant red niblets from under the counter and I open it and I put it in a little bowl and check if it's a little water and the chicken's on top of my refrigerator. Because I think chicken's eat corn, you had red dots and those that was the available one. I wish I had thought better of the nipple tiny one because... Because in fact, if you're buying three or four cans of niblets a day, which is what you can pay in your existing on almost nothing, which I was, then you're nibbled bill to that be,  some, , two figure percentage of the public. I really got to imagine, looking at $50 a week, and for $10,000, I was going to go spend a month. It's just hard just to find an extent  that. So, after the removal of 15 years, I think I can probably safely admit the analysis. One of the reasons that I stuck with the ablution is that I  saying the word in the book so much. And in this case, the excuse to use the word  the niblet in general conversation several times a day. It just doesn't come up. And the chicken stayed there and talked to my refrigerator for a long time, months, months. Is it  a one-room apartment? A two-room apartment. I had a kitchen and a bed, so I didn't have to look at the chicken when I was sleeping. Though I didn't have to look at it when I was coming. Did you have a cook chicken? Of course a cook chicken. Did you feel intensely in this while? No, I felt not particularly loyal to this chicken. I don't know if you've ever had chicken, but it's not , I mean, you don't have chickens. Chicken is not really  you to pet them and you don't fold them. There's really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life. I don't think. But yet, you kept it. I kept it because I couldn't bear it doing anything else. It's not  I couldn't carry it out on to a peekable heart and said, be free, a little chicken, be free. Did you give the chicken a name? I never knew. When I referred to the chicken public I was followed by him. How did you not mean it? It was a creature you had in my house. Chicken always didn't ever occur to me that I might have chicken long since month. Or the chicken always seemed  something that I would have for just a couple of days. And then what did you think? I guess not thought. A. I thought I was a chicken expire and B. I have to admit that there was a possibility that someday I would act in the kitchen. I went from large to large, hundreds in the kitchen. But thinking maybe this would be the rest of the poor my neighborhood bed chicken weeks after. Lastly, I have to say that the most delicious chicken that you could ever eat, because of this course. You can't find it with such a proper money from. I'm not sure that a risk being existed that would have lived up to the fact that this animal who you have come to know on fairly each of the charms and who you're brazen to a certain amount of motion. A chicken, if I might say, who has seen you naked? The chicken did see me naked, damn it. ival bank holders mini.com to be just food. And as soon as it becomes a living thing, especially for city people. what I used to the conversion of living things into our food. It's hard to handle without thinking it has to be bigger than food. , without wanting to make it ritualized or something bigger than food. It's accurate. Can I tell you a short, small story? Yep, of course. a few weeks ago I was in this Korean restaurant, and I really couldn't count the lessons. It was this place called the Living Fish Center, but I always wanted to go, because the name was so splendid. Living for you said, I imagine those things were  vast, the very important, the important thing. And I go in there, of course, it's just  the crime crime. I mean, it's not that clean. I don't know. know their tanks and stuff, they know what the button works. So I ordered a fish suit because it looks  they have a small fish suit. And it comes in and it's really strong spell that. And I try squid fried with bean sauce and I mean it was wasn't that happen. And I'm not gonna give up and pay the chat and go home. We'll be asked later. with stuff and suddenly cursed me with respect to the restaurant. And I waited wait for so long and I told her I'd  to pop. And she is possibly she didn't expect me to ask for her. I repeat when she said she tried to do something to tell us the sushi show. And he goes to one side of the restaurant and climb from his chair for dinner golden chair and reaches into this. one to take in front of his blood soon. And he wiggles his fingers in one. When he wiggles fingers, the pawns just become in rage. And they start, they're nippy at his fingers, start packing. And he takes out a couple of blood in his ones. Bring him back to his town. Without washing his hands, mine just makes emotions over it. And a couple of seconds later, the wait just comes over with the pawns. on the suit down the ice. What he done is he taken off the exit spell. Essentially, he had wasn't packed in that little part of the tale that is always unpawned and still there. But the middle part is leaking. a grub. And I think the problem was my chopstick. And it was not dead on the extreme July. And it was wiggling its legs. Which was when he had been pulled to get off his have none of my stuff. And I was looking back and seeing me as after the predator of the creations in the eating. And that was a really traditional because as much as as much stuff as I eat and as low low as I eat on the food chain and as many ponds as I have just passed my life. I have never before killed a living being. And it's in the pond, Europe. and he did not  me. And I wasn't quite sure what to do, but I have put it down the pond with God anyway. I didn't have to live without a shower, somebody else in the meantime was. So I did it into, I did a body-up routine, and the conscious relaxed in this way that was needed here. And... The taste of the prawn, the taste of the meat of it was extraordinary. I mean it was sweet, it was  a bite portion of the cord. It was the most wife in the earth. But again, it was freaking. It was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption, which is killing a little creature in the game. When you, when you bid into the prawn, you actually bite off the tail and it's good. and it had, it's head and it's eyes now. No, I did often part, and I held it, and I held it. So you had head, and I wanted to tell them that it's in. Run. And I thought that I, I thought that I filled it. In fact, when I put it down, it was still had someone's life in it that it grabbed pieces of Sam's shing and wouldn't let go of it. And I think everyone do that damn. Did you thought there was something about the experience that made it more... This word is a little corner of the name, Can't find some more that you think of. That made it more sacred. That took it out of the mundaneness, the way that we eat, which most of us is eating without actually tasting and experiencing. And tasting and experiencing. and thinking about what we're eating and what on the earth it is that we're killing. So, surah. Do you think in some way that it's more acceptable to be in animal if you are more away to the fact that it isn't animal and what's happening to it? But do you think it really doesn't matter? I think it matters a great deal. I mean one of the greatest metaphors in the Western Civil of the... is that Christ gave His life so that others might live. And I don't want to be saccharidious and I don't want to, , a little that myth in any way, but that take us give you the life so that we might eat, check us give you the life. And I think the least that we could do is to think about that. To think about that, yeah. Not necessarily. be sat for it, but to celebrate to be aware of the being that it was, that it wasn't just this, it, , by the way, , approaching somehow managed to find a friend who are playing. itudin, Turinad. Hamilton Gold rights Rec reason Chuth's cotton counterintelligence. Similarly, unique it is outside the restaurant, the Los Angeles community. Back to last meal. Consider please, culture consumers, rural poultry in French on the 12th last meal. We do annual call with French, France, 1996. Country degree and Edinmatic, French, press use to call up the States. Once actually staged its own assassination of the top poles. Obsessed with history and displacement. Back to last meal. Peter Nitty wrote about me to answer last meal with Max and S. choir. He's around that time. So our story begins just weeks before we start. Great for Christmas, we're going to get to communion with the Pharaohs. , he was streaming in the L side of the head, and he had to go there one last time. Did you see what he took to communion with Pharaohs? Yeah. Really with Pharaohs? Well, he felt his spiritual connection to... these leaders and he studied the lives and in particular how many of these people died, what their last gestures were. He felt that his last gesture would have to be recorded, he could regret. And while he was there he decided he was calling amazing last many. What he did was call back friends, and made sure that they had this many that he decided with the yet, which was this amazing piece of oyster, infloggerar, in pop and finally, this whole song called the little, which symbolizes the French soul. And it was this completely forbidden thing to eat or it's illegal in France to do so. And because it's an indigent speech. Yeah, and people who have third order one, chefs had served it in France, and then fine. And I think in one case, chefs and peasants, did you look at all the internet and why the order one would come to represent the solar France? It was... The food of chains in France and once it was caught in this tiny trance, they would in very old times of, I actually hooked it eyes, bird with lid and complete darkness and just eat, torn flowers, dead. Then when it was fattened, they would drown it and kind of hone it. And there was this ritual associated with preparation for this as well as eating. Actually in my cruise and fielding, I've heard a lot of here and supplies, production, adultery and jinnies. And one of the things that ultimately is that, who eat it with a hat over their phone. People put large cloth in the app and have their head and apparently with the napkin does. is it keeps the aroma inside this tent so that then what you're eating. And French say that it also keeps God from seeing eating little birdie. Meaning what? Meaning that it's sinful. It's the birdie so innocent and the pleasure is so great. And the pleasure is so great. That it's a sin. And Nick Rarmony had his last meal. He knew he was dying. And he could need to survive for quite a while after the last meal. He lived eight days. He didn't eat drank from his days. He just decided he wanted the last meal that he didn't eat before. Yeah, it's pretty, I mean, that was the most incredible thing he said. He's... Have a... huge dinner and then consciously decided that would be his last meal and then he's ready to himself for that. So you were meant to go to France to try to taste this bird, have this meal in fact to try to recreate meat alongside the meal. And it started with a hundred phone calls just to try to locate somebody. with an entertainment mission. And after literally, onts, there was one chef in Porto who said that he would do a truck of milk. And so you have this massive meal ending with her. It's, and what do we know about when meat rock? Well, we know that during the meal, we slipped in our consciousness in between the courses. And he would eat the evidence. And then he would sort of pass out and he sat at a table separate. The table will ask guests, guests, there are about 30 people there. Stand at family and friends. And Mittiron would rise up with each new course, but he really wasn't talking to me, he was really focused and trying to finish the music. Finish the music. and taste apparently every note in the ears. When you had a dream note, do you feel you were able to achieve that level of awareness for your taste? , since it's high, it's ended too, it's fine. I thought it was the most incredible note, because I'm very focused. everything we need to know. And also because when you're cute, the art one, there's no easy way to eat art one. You are forced to taste every bite. And it goes from being completely sublime to being excruciated. Describe what it's  to be a sad bird. You just have to is the size a smaller someone. It is. It's about the size of your thumb and it sits enough to serve it in white castle red. The napkin over your head and duck down and part it. Castle red. So you are in this space that is completely white. The white napkin and white clay white castle red and that's bird on its back. Let's go and put into mouth. You cool it by breathing in and out and this is the However, every part, yes. In our case, the chef insisted that we quite often had on point. I think in Midarans case, he agreed to. So you'd write up ahead, we'd have a comment. And then you can call it anything to chew. That is... That first bite was incredibly difficult to describe. It was terrifying. It was terrifying. It was not just the idea of it. But the first bite of the bird changed that. It was incredibly and almost immediately delicious. And all these juices falling out of it, and tear mouth, and it's going to be going. and then you begin to taste the meat, the little tender bits. And then I think you begin to taste the rotten bits. You come from a bit of sweet, as the tenderness turns. bitter in there. And then what you keep showing are one until you have to do it completely in your first discovery all at once. And there's no other way really to consume. And as you as you continue to chew, it gets harder and harder because you're working the bones. So meet in Jesus' faith in certain arch. to these phones. That is when we had the ballad to a bit of an existential crisis. what the hell am I doing? And then also at the really thing I'm going to throw up. And how am I going to swallow it? And how am I going to swallow it? I mean, you really, many people who've never had or had Orton on the floor and that's fitting it out on the plate. And then back it, hit her on the last meal. number, that's the people in the room, did spit out their order. That seems  you incredibly bad form. You're spitting out the solar frames. Yeah, you're incredibly gosh. You're all that stuff. Do this in space, can you? Yeah, that function is you. You need chicken for a long time. Why? Because I think I thought it. Why do you think it's you? and didn't feel  it was right to eat a bird without a sacred quality that would have been good. Yeah, I think it has everything to do with feeling in some ways  I had actually eaten a last meal and for me to put anything else inside of my body with me that it can have to be somehow and it's not  I ate. And suddenly a vegetarian. Finally, whatever, because of those hungry, without thinking about, for instance, the life that was on the side. What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? Was it really not tasty? Oh. Yeah, it takes a lot of energy, concentration, takes the big, all of these things that become so scary. When, when, when, really, taste the meal, takes concentration, and silence, and, same time, understand how that milk tuned to your table. Where you describe the sounds of yourself, you were really awake. To what the world. is giving us and it will be hard to meet me all every single time. Yeah, I think we would, I felt it with age really quickly. Seeing with age, we would be doing some of us thinking it's much, the mental work. Yeah, there's a new, yeah. Yeah, the , the time elapsed version of your life, if you were just  free, spiritually, just play, unfortunately. eroticly, doesn't, better be new. You saying that we didn't know self-snoted that we are. I think I think we do two degrees. But I think we're, but we're, as they were radical about what we're saying, you're saying, maybe that isn't such horrible thing, maybe that actually that has to wear. I mean, I wish it weren't, but I don't think we're, I don't think we're making up time. And we have to make up time, please. things better not. It's a taste of the other. Michael Pettinetti, pork. Coming up, the woman who thinks this American life is bad for any higher species. What a perfect magnitude does not do what you want it to do. That's a minute. In that sort of video, it can really asked you to do this a quickly with NAS version. This is Mary Klyt, my class. I'm going to plug in the courses. Dean, I'm writing a story. Today, during the week, thanks for giving me a Christmas. You're whole treat in social sense, great experience. We bring you our annual whole treat, slam. Stories, chickens, turkeys, ducks, paddle off. And we're a little bit of a shit. We've come to act three of our program, act three. People who love birds, eat this very much. Well, hope you might hear. Let's take a bite and say it's about 50 letters. Let's see if you can see from around the country. Here's one from now on for some work in Dins. Dear Miss Glass, I was profoundly shocked to learn that two years in a row during Thanksgiving and Christmas season, we've used old tree slam program, which grew with meat and jokes and vegetables and vegetables. Please. Little. See you in the next one. Dear Miss Glass. And we shot 20 years in a row. I am programmed. The word is, , the wordings identify most of the web. The first wave from male, organized by women in the parent days, has found her who coordinated the web. If I did it onto the program, track whatever misinformation she thought we were spreading, she intervened by me. That's all. And poetry. In. Okay, birds. Go! Three morning parents, let's pick up birds at 3rd garage house, the standard of night as protection is present. It's okay, come on! Bird birds? Run out! It's a lovely, friendly ass. It seems  a bug at all. Nearly all these birds, refugees, on the commercial poultry. Cancer can serve birds on it. rocks, that's a high state. So that animal's so, it's got a green. She gets birds with school patching brush. And now she's got a big penskin backyard. Pull it off. These two roosters at a time first were used by the meat and the screen. So you can see they're extremely large. Very overweight, they're crippled. You're typical. Sick. Well, one city doesn't get up. They have skeletal properties. They're entire skeletal scale. to the system, so it's not able to accommodate the rapidly growing body that's close to the ground, the skeletal system and the ground. So they are very susceptible to be crippled and too having a wide range of skeletal diseases. In nature it takes to 10-6 months to go to the home to church, but it was selected reading and especially fun with the... the culturally-industry now raises birth, full size just to 6 weeks. Then the butcher. What herandates to do it is convert a life that cannot to be a free rock. Putting on all the sets of weights and fasts and young trains the heart and lung, she says, typically the bodies give out just two years old. There's verses traditional and mirrors. When she finds she cares for these birds in the loving way. That's how the crowded chicken passes they were going into. They said they defied the stereotypes, most people have that. That's stupid, dirty, cold, and angry. One of the first birds can be had fallen off the truck. He was from a free to operation. had a steerly DB to upper beat and he was covered with film, the invention became very snowy white. He was very scared of people and he was  anybody who's lived in a, as a, as a creature with no identity and a mass situation, he had no sense of who he was or where he was. But this changed after he had been with me and my husband for about three or four months, very, very affection. He liked to be held, the sputters in it very deeply and I think he came up. very sweet and fresh bird and he, with common I would call him up to that steps. Here's one area with parent days, the elite enterprise and I and my videos that can have some fun. In the earlier poultry slams, the record cards were first stupid, seven million personnel. And last year's show was one point, I myself required. Chickens had a personality, personality since they're eating gas. While this may be stupid, the chicken types are if you raise them the how to do a commercial production. She didn't raise properly, but it can be kind of sweet. This hen is familiar with us. She was playing great full time. And she... Karen shouldn't have left. We'll have to next her. And we'll be together. And we'll have to go to the forest and then we'll start. Get her up. The forest. So we'll shop. It says meat eatery's  me usually don't  it. She doesn't have a certain heart. Because then he's hard to eat. They're very homey birds. That's another thing is if you go out and share out here and you're sitting out here reading a book or working on something or you're sat down on the steps. They're all quite around you. They  to be with you. They  to sit with you. They  to bring themselves next to you. You've dealt with you for hours. It was one of the first things that drew me to them. We're on the yard after hour and then when it's side. and when we got to discuss in the American life, after it meet got the big show. Karen Davis sees her annual poultry slam, because one long piece of insensitive meaty chicken propaganda. I thought it was a discussion show, and it was just a typical tradition of, , let's make certain jokes about poultry and do it in a variety of voices, and it's just a means for your show. It is very responsible, very responsible to present lies to really just take a collage of host-alattitudes and complacent, smirking voices and put them all together and feel that we are doing something worthwhile. I understand the show is something that this is about American, this America,  we see and it is so, it is really about us, not about us. them, but they're submerged to get the bad rap. If you've heard much of today's program, you must try and get it off. You've got a pretty good sense of tone of previous films. You need a story that actually tries to document cruelty to health, for instance, one woman's rather grim memoir, running a 30-point. Even this, you're not a prince, oh, it's good. I put it out that after stories and previous years, I'd not think about you. check it. When we started that and I bet, when we was better radius, we were called chicken now. When we was not that chicken little, staged entirely with pink eyes. Harry would have known that. I remember this woman speaking about... the chicken is operative or what you can of course was just a joke about the chicken little being operative,  that itself gets disparaging it's not the worst kind of you can do but the woman's whole voice the very tone of her voice the attitude the way she talked about chickens was not in a spirit of good will it's just what's it's an ill-willed presentation. I think that's very a passion towards the characters in our work. She made some hospital comments about chickens again at no connection with them. chicken's even our makeshift, no any chickens or sell. She's just doing what so many people do. She's just popping off the top of her head. chickens are easy to, , again, make into characters so you can laugh, smirk over her. I don't think she's not letting me get some. There's a lot of meat. She loves her chicken. She's letting me look all the way. She's pretty  she loves. In fact, on that show, the chickens had no personalities and didn't know who they were. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was one of those kinds of statements. That was just one moment. In a certain way. Have a listen. to do the chickens and much more to do with what it means to create some emotional grand abs, these are small, stinkmunks. Apparently there's a night argued for a long time that whether it is anything that everyone could all sound slandered in this truth. And in the end, simply do not lose. Ask for why there's this genocide, maze of chains fell. That's an television footage for the terrorist who can splash with a team. And it's a weak, many more people than we do when I read yourself. Bye, friends. Do you feel  by stopping us? That that's going to change the situation. That that's going to have to be kept remember for its children's treatment. It could. You're part of the problem. As long as you do the show called a poultry slam. You're part of the problem. You're one of the reasons. You're one of the many components of the abuse. You're part of the problem. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. Back for meaning of Chai. For most of us, perhaps little to no content with living greed and chance. In fact, is the chickens name what we decided to do. May this story today track off which begins far, far away from the inches. Friday nights of my childhood when we have lessons for spend to make new meanings in social times. My brother is just an element. Meeting is the right response. Thanks for coming. We're not even spent many of our huge involves three. Life indeed will achieve some people. Picking all of this are in this huge grapes. The spread on our brows are shining remind from the number of the glimpses. In the evenings we were gathered together in pants around the fire. Sing crossbeats to those national gums on the sand, if ones older siblings were in the education. Lose our routine. Years later we would run out of wood, pronged to guard everywherething in the resonate. This would all change from once to share 5,000 seconds.
