  "text": "This story of voyeurism, innocent voyeurism, starts off simply not. Pete was supposed to meet a friend which got off from work. He arrived to Iowa, so I was early. So to kill two hours, I was just wandering around in the alleys, digging through the dumpsters around there, seeing what there was in them. And as much as I  to look through dumpsters, I, there's not a whole lot to them. Excited about finding. Not real big on easy, good at dumpsters. So the one thing that really gets mixed excited is finding other people's nails. I love feeding other people's nails. I actively look for it on the streets and in people's scar witches, in dumpsters, at post office. On this particular day, he found a big bag of wedgers, maybe a hundred pieces of mail written over yearning. He's excited. This is my hours of reading. They were in no chronological order, so I just had to open the first one that I could grab and bread one after another that way. And which was kind of confusing at first because I jumped right into the middle of what appeared to be a relationship between them woman and a man. But it's slow. I slowly put it together as a puzzle. He's pictured and merged as he puts puzzle together. Women lived in another country, the guy with the United States, and while visiting her country, staying in a hotel there, he suffered the swimming once. She wanted to see him again, idealized him, wanted to come visit him. None of these trips ever seemed to happen. He only had the gutter's the cheered written per set of the story. But sometimes in her letters she replied to the things that he said. And over the course of the correspondence also the things happened. Swimming went jail and then ride it. about the guy and then finally admitted the whole thing. She lied about a daughter. She actually said that a daughter of hers had died. And then finally admitted that I was just lying about that. And over the course of these letters, this woman solely puts her right in order. She goes to school, she gets in the job, often taking the advice from the guy. I think it's just she never had somebody to even take my daughter's at the冠 BeastWorld yesterday. problems too. And early nobody who was stable. And so yeah he says it's going to be the tonic and she said oh that's fine that's fine. When you read between lines she just wants to see him and maybe once they reunited in this part, I'm fine again. As you read people start to feel protected and dishonored. The guy seemed to be sending messages. The guy I've seen with him, Er aller y shuts. is making things remote with sear but then it always closh and plants that they had to actually get together. And this is the thing about reading other people's manual. As you read, you cannot help but read between the lines. Anybody with any part, any half sense of entity, fills in the details that are missing. You're turning to this world that's part, fiction writer, and part detector. I had to keep in mind that he had just thrown these letters out. It's a matter of how important. She may say that he is to her. Some point he puts behind the sliders now or in the dumpster. Welcome to the Beezish Khaagon Public Radio International. It is this American life, my regards. It is we going to program of course, we choose some theme. Bring you back to mental stories with your fiction. Radio S says anything you can think of on that theme. It is program. Other people's mail, stories of people reading stuff do not spend the same in the first place and how it moves the hearts. And what happens after that. Act one of our program today, dead letters, which lions walks through a card junkyard and finds in the crumpled up racks, letters and notes of the people who once lived in these cars. Act two, thief. Cobbock's girl steals other people's mail, months since and reads an excerpt from her short story. Act three, save yours. Of is it to the only post-apps employees or about to actually leave your mail? These are the people who deal with letters who suppresses or unreadable or incorrect or non-existent. They open up the mail to try to get it to where it's supposed to go. Act 4 for yours. Which are on a Sarah Vow. It's fine. With me. Let's take a look at this. Act 1. Dead letters. For Richard Lyons' in the band, Negative Lab, which is known for using a lot of pounds sound in their recordings. And a couple years ago, he put together these zero-acts, but just a couple copies of it for a few prints. And there was native these objects here, if them. But there's notes. It really is some crample document. When you open to any of the page, you see it's on the right side of the photo of some smashed up demolished car. And on the left there's a letter or a shopping list or some note found inside that total event. He reads, tell the story here, obvious names and certain identifying details. The inspiration for my project came about in the spring of 1994, while visiting a local automobile wrecking establishment in Contracosta County, California. While searching for a bend-expring for negative lands company mascot, a 1976 Mercury Monarch E.A., I made a shocking discovery. I stumbled upon a metallic root beer in 19th century. 71 Dodge Demon that I'd previously owned and meticulously maintained until selling it two years earlier. To my horror, the car had been broad-sided with great force, the occupants had been neatly extracted with the jaws of life, through a perfect cut over the edge of the roof line. Upon further inspection it became obvious that the car had not only been wrecked, but trashed over a period of time before him. Curiosity led me to search its interior for clues on what methods of torture. could have brought my one's beautiful car bombs to this end-skate, and what I found was fascinating. The melted plastic seeds and orange carpet were littered with an assortment of paper scraps, documenting the life of a 17-year-old single mother and her its altruist relationship with an abusive 38-year-old boyfriend. The car smelled of sewage water, and empty Pepsi containers attracted bees, but I continued to collect and cool  everything I could find. Love notes, hate lives, personal records, receipts, photographs. Dear us, Jack, if you love me as much as you say you do, we please spend time with me in the baby. You said you take care of me, I don't know what I should do to make me keep you promise. I love you, Jack, and I hope you will forgive me for not being able to do some things but about. But I want you to at least be here for all of us, I hope you can see my point. Do you please come back? Love. of hair and men. Several days passed before I fully realized the extraordinary effect this experience had on. It couldn't help wondering if she'd been killed or badly injured. And what about her infant's son? Was she even in the car? Perhaps her drunken bow when a fit of uncontrollable rage had taken the demon on its It's a very beautiful joy ride. It check doesn't want to be with the earmatch, you can do whatever you want. I don't care if you want to do crank and everything else to get high. I can find someone who will be better for me and I know will be around at least sometimes care about me and us both. I recall observing similar remains and other discarded vehicles. And upon further consideration, I picked up my camera, let's see what else. was out there. The older cars were the most interesting. Unpaid parking tickets, failure to appear notices, an open mail from collection agencies, lottery receipts, losing game cards for fast food restaurants. Then there were the letters. I found one letter in a 1977-buelic regal, through Fitbit, completely torn off, and the body was twisted and had. My love to. Hi, how are you doing? I can get to be this hellhole. I love you with all my heart and it's you very, very bad. I got four months, that's 102 days here at jail. Joe, if you love me  to say, when you wait and replace, whatever you do , don't need me to come see me outside of it, visiting out as two to four p.m. I heard you were here to see me, but I never seen you, it happened to you. When I love my life, I won't be here too long. I'm hurt because I never seen you in court with me, a cow and seduice here. I'm fine to get a three. way far so I can call you. If you can find someone with a three way phone please get the phone number let me know. Well, Joe this is just a little letter to let  what's going on. When I get more paper I'll write you more longer letters. I'd love you Joe with all my heart and see you again. Forever your love Debbie. death Joe genuine said you don't want talk to me so we are through each other and I'm getting a portrait. I don't want your baby so we can go along. Love Deb. I photograph every car I searched, I'll be information in the form of a zerox book. Transcribing the text exactly as it was written in the positioning index of the photo. I pulled a list from a crush in 1886. seven bulks  box, idle, what I need. Houch, love sea, chair, coffee table, dinner table, TV, radio. I found a writing assignment by a local community college to did a total Chevy van. Apparently, he had learned his lesson. James D. Englishw. 22, November 22, 1993. 1. A car accident two years ago taught me the dangers of drinking and driving. A car accident. It's bad. 2. Who? Him and his buddies. What? Go drunk. When? 1130 p.m. Street. Where? Route 11. Why? Yo stupid island view. 3. Yes? The answer is all questions. 4. Body carlo supersports. 9.4 Eastern. Route 11. 5. Yes. It all leads up to driving drive. 9. I came upon a 1979 Cadillac with brawl. whose front end was so mangled that the engine was pushed through the fire wall and up into the wind sheet. In it was another student paper. And this one was probably past quietly in class. Natalie Baby, so how are you sweet? You look so cute. Say next time you talk to Mars, tell her I hope she feels better. Why is she so sick? Well, how's your baby? I can tell it's going to be so cute just because you look so cute. Happy 25 week anniversary. Yeah. So what's your name, too? Since you forgot to write me, I wrote you, cool huh? Well babe, pretty neat note huh? Not. I gotta go, but you better write back to me. See ya, Audrey. Tell Baby Ison, hi. I found a letter in 1978, Toyota Sella Corritain. Car was so badly crushed on the left side that the driver's door took up the entire front seat Still, hello, how are you? I'm okay, but we could go. I got burned on my right hand. We had a grease fire and kitchen and I was Seed second to two burns on my hand. We were gonna make tacos. We left a few seconds and went up and flames. That's why my writing's not that good. It's really not as bad as it sounds. I can't remember if I told you but I had a miscarriage to lie eight times. I was almost been a month and I'm doing a lot better. I was in the hospital six hours. I thought I had three IRs, but my X roommate and the shell said I had five. I'm kind of glad I lost it since I wasn't in love with the guy. I told him I was pregnant and he really seemed  he didn't care. Also, okay, I didn't love the guy.

Whether it can be consequences to reading other people's mail, friend of mine told me this story about his first job. In the show, he was a reporter at a small newspaper in the small town. And then a basic office computer system. One day on a whim, tried to log in as the owner of newspaper. For the password, he just typed in the name of the guy's grandson. He worked. Suddenly it accessed the every file on newspapers. in the future. Story of counting record if you email. My friend says it was miserable. Most of the mail was pressing a banal note with reading. The main thing that he learned was that at the beginning of the year nearly everyone in the office had gotten a bigger raise than he had. According to stories he thought was terrible. Terrible. He had made much more than he did. When you open up if you're a people's mail, things can happen. Unless you're careful. But with that in mind, we turned to Mona Simpson. She's the author with numerous books. This is an excerpt. I'm sure it's story she would be here as well. God wants. I steal. I've stolen books and money and even letters. Letters are great. I work in the mail room, my dormitory, Saturday mornings. I saw it mail, but the letters in this long mail copy box. Inside the mail boxes. It's cool there when I stick in my home. I've stolen cash. These criss-crackling brand new $20 bills. I've stolen the dollar bills. I've stolen the brand money. sealed up in sheets wax paper. Once I got a 50. I've stolen presents too. I got a sweater under football. Mostly what I take up cookies, no evidence to edit book. I can spot the coffee cans and chocolate chip. You can smell it right through the wrapping. Cool smell,  inside the pantry. Sometimes they eat straight through the can, do it mushroom. Tapering with the United States males at Echo Crime below. Listen, let me tell you, oh no. I got a summits in my mailbox to go to the Olympic office next Wednesday. Sure, I'm speaking with you. The university cops want to talk to me. Great. They think the suspect is the word they use. That one of us is throwing out nails instead of sorting. Us is the others, I'm not the only sort of. Just work Saturdays. male comes in her 60s a week in the morning. They'll never guess it's me. They say this in the letter, they think it's out of laziness, wanting to hurry up and get done, not spend the time. But I don't, or I'm really patient outside of the mornings. I leave my dorm early while Lauren still asleep at open the mail room. It's this heavy door and I have my own key. And I get there two bags already on the tape, sagging, waiting for me. two old ladies, one's packages, one's mail. There's a small key open the bank doors, the little boxes from the inside. Here's a glass part of every mail slot, I can see. The Astriture field across the street over the parking lot in the slight green. I watched the sky go from glass to grey to blue while I'm there. Some days just stay foggy, close to the best. Once you open a letter, you can't just put mailbox. It's first to be a sazy. So I stashed in my pack of phone mail, just people I know, Susan Brown, I open and you are seeing Larry helping me. All the popular kids from my high school. These are kids who go by sister-daughter to patients. They all see you, they went to the pub and went to get you. At morning nutrition, nutrition is your great content about the donuts and stuff in California State Law you have to have. I used to meet outside of the far end of the math problem or all of our food. Some of the smoke, I've seen the look at each other, the serve, and in the morning. One touch the inside of another's wrist, a grown-up's travel. And now I know everything I thought there's three years worse tears in my life to do that to you. But once here get letters, carries Santa Cruz, Lilies and San Diego, happens at Harvard best at Stanford. And  from families their letters talk about problems, their each others leave lives. You always knew bookly from the high school. They weren't just kids red fun, they cared, they cared about things. They all worried about really now. They're in an annual fun, down to talking to St. Steve. I saw Glenn, the day I actually looked at him. I took a walk from campus and I'd be walking from the wall to the wall. And then I see Glenn coming down with a little nobody need from him. Writing one of those long morses sitting on the grass behind the side of the smile. Let me just smile. If I was to describe the hideous hair, I have to tell my priest on. He was wearing his bright orange vest and I thought, false. I saw him that night again, and I don't have to turn you. This is the first time I've been in love. I worry. I'm a bad person, the Glenn, the perfect guy, and means to me at least. And he takes you love speed, I've got a key from him to finding out. I'll die before I'll tell him. Glenn, okay Glenn. He looks  Mick Jagger with his sweep, ten times sweet. Let's... He's about 10 years old. His father's doctor overtly cement and logical searching. First time we got together a whole bunch of us from the blinds we did we do it. Friends we make collect beer cans and they haven't stacked up. Watching TV and finally everybody else leaves. There's nothing on but those gray lines and blinds we've already fed and asked me if I'd rub his back. I couldn't believe this was happening to you. I knew I didn't have to do anything. I'll just... I was sitting on his rear end rubbing his back when he was shooting on the wheels. All of a sudden I was worried about my breath and what I smelled them. My face was down in the mirror. I tried to sniff myself and I couldn't tell him. It'd it riddle right in. I don't open Glenn's letters, but I touched them. I hold them, smell them. None his nails has any smell. He doesn't get many letters. His parents live across the Bayon World County, and it might. He gets letters from his grandmother in Michigan, playing with her writing and writing and writing in her books. The sticker was for the Chinese last printed on. World Route number three comes to see about it more and more. And he gets letters from Diane, die, recalling. I schoolgirlfriend. As a pushy mother wanted these scientists that she already got a suit and wanted. I got late plus, not a bread. You never slept with him, though. She wouldn't. She still would bird to down the sand, yeah, but with Louis, maybe they even know each other. When a die will pop your kids in their high school, red would hide. No, I'm when, because a bread, his name is Goodman, come here. That's fine. Not because of me, I just know okay, I'm not going to start fooling myself now, please. For letters I hold up to the light, it got fluorescent light to me. She's supposed to be blonde, , pretty quiet, soft time. And the envelopes, she writes on the sheer blue-pulled envelopes they get transparent, and I can see them writing on the leaf that not enough to be what it says. It's  those hot lines making it a real surprise. I run my tunnel on the place where his grandmother seemed to let the sharp sweep WT's once I cut my tongue. That's where keeps you going to the bottom of bed. I'm always wondering if there'll be a letter for grand. He doesn't get one, he will be. It's  a treasure, a package at the house. But I'd never open friends name. I kiss all four corners where his fingers were touched for a pretty new spot. I brought home cookies for Lord of the... just a present. Will eat him or go ahead and eat him. I'll throw him out, go on here. The chocolate chip with the cons, this was one big mother. I loved it, I got his coffee too. I bought it. Yeah, okay, so I'm in trouble. Wednesday at 10.30 I got the notice of school school period. I had a class, and one seed, pre-med staple, you put a couple of things. I never missed it before. I told Glenn I had a doctor support me. Okay, so I skipped it anyway, and I walked into the room where there's these two other guys, all work we may only do what I do sorting. And we all sit there on chairs on this green carpet. I was staring at everybody's shoes. And there's a cop, University cop, I don't know what's the difference. You had the sagging pear shape body. I got my dad would have she with that, he's not his thing. He walks slowly on the carpeting, his figure soaked in his belt loops. I was watching his hips. Anyway, he's accusing us all, he's trying to get one of us to admit we did it. No way. I hope one of you will come to me until the truth. And I don't want to know anything about this? Come on now. I shake my head no, stare down at the pairs of shoes. He says nothing. do anything to the person who did it right, want to make it that. They say they just want to know but they'll take it back to Susan Tellman. I don't care why I don't believe him. I know one thing for sure and that's they're not going to do anything to me as long as I say no I didn't do it. That's what I said no I didn't do it. I don't know anything about it. I just can't imagine whether Susan Tellman just did it wrong. Our letters got into Garb's community awful. I just don't know. This tall skinny guy with a blunt mustache while he's It's kind of  a rabbit. It's intended us. This is another sort of works Monday, Wednesday, Wednesday. We all do our jobs, he says. None of us would do that. Rabbit guy looks at me, the other girl who's support. So we're going to stick together. The other girl, dark-born, she really looked, not... I love that rabbit guy that said. I don't too. I'm going to cut the rabbit down. Why it hits the coffee with milk cups. I'm just going to keep saying no, not me to do it. And I just want to do it. And that's all. I want to do it anymore. So this is Glenn's last chance for homemade chickens. I'm sure it's not for the baking. I signed the Forbes that I didn't do it. I'm not even wrong. I'm safe. It turned out okay after all it always does. I always think something terrible has been happening. It doesn't. I'm walking. I was walking just a little while ago to stay down top of the ground and these two policemen after one night night, other policemen probably were on direction. I started sweating a lot. I was sure until the past is, I was sure it was all over day with air from me. I always think that. But at the same time. I know it's just my motivation. I'll be in the fourth quarter of the student I'll be my school of just walking down the street for a quarter. Capitalist Monus Simpson, reading meggs, from the story once. Coming up, post on four years reading your mail and then you'll go to the studio. Yes, you. That's a minute. Publicity International. Wonderful. Well it's this American life, my reclass, the treatment of problems caused with something very wide variety of ridles. for the Office of the National Producer's Tico Wack at that theme. Today's show, other people's mail, they'll grab your heart, but we want it to not. We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, Savior's. If you worked with US Post Office, opening and reading other people's mail was actually one of the worst things you could do. You can be fired, investigated, prison, and less. You work in a mail with recovery center. There are three mail recovery centers in the midst. Painter, Sacramento cell. Now that cannot be delivered to any other means ends up there, there is open for a good cause to work for clues to get it to you. How tough visited these male savers is he called? There are a lot of risks that I can't see them in the morning. Someone left the address on the left, someone moved and then anybody down. Someone's on the left, that wet. But whatever reason, and it's all out of it, there are 150,000 risks in the mail that arrive for each day. I'm free each day. In the 75 people work here, obviously we have the same job. So we're nothing else. We're looking at that. And see if they can figure out where it's supposed to go. And they see pretty strange things. The rest of us don't. Soon, but post-on cross section. And then we'll send them to the Water Mercomaries. A clerkman learned a co-sad. Talk about some of those live up. Sometimes it'll be mice, dead mice, naturally dead. at mice or bugs that are sending somebody to tell them to bug off and they'll throw in a real bug that used to be alive. Things  that, when you're scanning, you just open it and you jump because you don't know what it is and then you dump it out and you find it. Dog poop, we hope it's dog poop. SIGGER at bugs, they'll empty their ash trays into an envelope and send them to somebody. And is that that's him? Package and certain letters. It's in letters. It's amazing now, put things in the letters that should never be there. Never, ever should be in a letter, but they'll put it in there. Tap it shut and throw it in the mailbox and we end up with it. The goal is always to return to the lost mail. It's possible. It's nice to see you. There's a check in the envelope, there's an address on the check. Send it back. Sometimes the person's moved and left in a forwarding address. In that case, there are clerks who scan through these huge computer databases of names and addresses. sometimes they can find a good address that one. Sometimes they have to resort to real detective work. Ken Gunk who's been working here for us. Came across the Christmas park and a bunch of photographs. One of the photographs is a I know it's a person that he sent the letter at the top she was showing off her house and her Christmas tree presence. She was standing by a fireplace and there's a whole bunch of her Christmas letters. A lot of mantle there. So what I did is I took the magnifying glass and we had a friend we were able to all cheese together for address, it was five or six different Christmas cards that she got on the mantis and I moved it ice string but couldn't get her name but we got her address, street address , I see it, but up to the end of the night we sent her back to the best algumas, but tracked almost out and searching their first Facebook even found speaker making all this effort. Only 10% of the packages, 30% of the letters through the process successfully sent out. But some items are just no way to get the code as much. We know how to slow return out. It's nothing more. But then there are other items that maybe could be, if you were willing to kind of have a pretty difficult time called questions. The question is, what is it? And that's when you are just starting what's worth saying. That's all. Greg Hawthorne is the happy secret button. This is not actually a deal. So maybe a little predictably when I ask the height of the side, that's sent back, it doesn't even go back to work. We have a call of the film covering man's role as one of six. All regulations are in there. This is that we've had the same regulations for years. Somebody somewhere down the road, you can't please. That's what we go about. What that's among somewhere inside was essentially what out of our food is about? These are the regulations that checks they always understand that legal papers stops with your kids The personal letters they have in this world is that if there's something more to know or something that can seem back But everything else is supposed when we receive 150,000 lives a day We don't have time to set the freedom so personal letters are basically straight. That's great. But when I talk to the people in my city, they're doing a hard time story. This is easy. There are policies that, , what are women's side, but we may have an accepted, we see a foreign male for instance, a medicine department, a wedding and a tissue. We're able to return time. Something  that, policy says no, don't you think that gravity might judge the human world and no muscles or no muscles or no muscles. The reason for this difference with humans is pretty simple. It's not the greatest of the Bible book square, it's a rule that is soft. It's not the greatest management in humans. It's the greatest freedom of the world. An aunt that can learn and not gain perfection before night they go. Stay tuned for more videos. And that changes the face to face and the parts of our lives is about the point. What is important is one human being is maybe not important to not a human being. This is what it is. And I'm giving an example of this is something I do, it's probably not a lot of people. For example, people say I'm a little angel, , in a positive sense. Real positive thing that they're saying to someone. someone who is in real bad, having a really bad life for them. They're very depressed. They're on the verge of suicide and you can kind of scan that you see that there wasn't maybe enough postage on it, there wasn't enough whatever I send it for, to the person that they're trying to send it to. And it may seem unimportant to someone else and perhaps the postal service wouldn't think it was maybe important, but I feel it is. I feel it's within our realm. to make that sense. The clerks here see it's a strange experience to see all of the thoughts. Strange not always happened. One day after work, many of us said our Americans had a big detail on us and we spoke from our older one that is experienced. See a lot, it's not just  you see news. See that in the news I see that at work all the time. This goes on and that is on. It's people's lives to see it. the letters, whose half the ceiling. And then he actually had to fight for those dots, and he took the job from the other curves. She first came from the middle of the temple, and she took the job of the carpentine, and the previous jobs. But after five years, she was told that she couldn't work. I said that because of her injuries, she wasn't able to do the job. I was suspected that she didn't think that this was possible for us. She got the grievance, and after a few months in my first she weren't job done. I think she got the job done. here. She's the one who seems to be the most important thing that she sees. I'm not just because everything is yet to go to bed. Stay. But it's not. It bothers me to see a lot of people that are so much problems that they've said to me, sad letters to someone who does get to them. I've seen a couple of letters that we  long last love trying to content. It was sad. couldn't find something that were unanders descended on to that. And then there are people in the world that are very, very, very, very, very, very, very little. And then I think, I feel  it wish she could reach out and take all the names of all these people, which we not allowed to do, right down the maze and addresses and go out and try to help them out. , just take up the collection for them for some. I should say at this point, all of the classes. especially that emphasizing not just that you do a problem now, reading through people's personal mental free classes. They open first class and they have to look for items in fact. Things that are worth more than $10,  we used to catch, or use, and focus. And then they scan the letters. They don't read them, and they don't talk to the scan, they don't look for an address, or name any information that might help you to the letter to where it's supposed to go. I believe everyone told me this, I don't think anyone at the Miller College Center reads a mail for any time, for your first and third. Bye bye! I also set back everything to set. The reality is more complicated. Congratulations. And we've just a letter from a child, mother, a pussy, or a food name, ready to stay alive. The human material in front of us, had a lot of empty publics came over, a more slow, easy to perhaps absolute mess. Someone telling someone, it's over. I don't care for you anymore. Or, she's so and so died. Or, I'm so and so got killed last year. Or, you're daughters. dying of cancer, people writing, although they may be a burst certificate or something inside and they're writing to someone. Here's your daughter's burst certificate. You can take care of the kids I'm leaving or people break it. That feeling of personal connection to the first step, , the people's there sometimes are painful. And it's also precisely what makes no everyone the most sad after jobs and customers. I didn't quite know as a house up. after the job it is that to us spoke one morning to adjourn germs. He doesn't want to talk to us anymore. He works for the union in St. Paul and represents us. But before you got to do a job spent 12 years working as a person, so to speak. As you told me that about half the people who work in the process work out of silent, and where has it? Where they operate the giant machines to show the delicious machines? I don't machine that we work in, and we call it no-assels and we don't want to send a small to position but it's showing machine. There's actually  12 consoles. Take a crew of the bands and variables. Take a crew off camera. 18 people that we run it. They would be sitting in our 12 councils and come on people that were voting. People that run boxed machine suit. We had the one to see a letter that was on machine and also grabbed the name, and then I was shot based on great fun of us. On at a time, in the stop in front of us, we had four chances of something to put the mail, read the zip code on the address. Decide where it was to go and on the mail it took off. Music is on the new machine, it's just... And into key, to series of files, slash folder and которую files are what makes machine opening sustain butt Society. We out of these these pairs are what's up. And I want to talk to you about back in the years. But the people who were... to work at the same moment on top of the Senate, may, fact, suit to go back to the Mills-Petraps in the state. When I was, everybody was talking about this proposal that was shown at the Senate and just to the point. No one's sure now whether it's really a good happen. The information is hard to come by for people that work there. But next October, the post-office Board of Governors is going to need to discuss the Senate's future and we might as well have to sign a shout-of-death. A lot of the people that's working the same of the council, saw this as a Senate and move to the House of çafties on the Christians. A few years ago there was seven young Christians in this manner. That is, and there's talking of closing the doors . The reason is that the people in charge of the Christians have a Christian who comes to the more and more on trust and that is out of action. Every part of the Christians from the letter sorting to the delivery, you can know that there's becoming more out of the themselves that they're posting, you'll ask them, you'll ask them, you'll ask them, I think it was you that said better than you said that if the people have top new new ones going on If you knew what sort of work people were doing here They wouldn't be trying to close that what is it that they don't know if they're in Washington and they're Fire away from this facility some of them have never worked in a work floor the these people that are in charge of the coastmaster general I don't believe is everything post So they don't have it any concept of what goes on in the system. The sad part is, even if those people came here physically, they just, I hate to say it, my opinion, I don't think. And that is sad for the customer, it's sad for me to take pride in your work, want to be with right for the customer. And these people are making decisions so magical. The great thing about the melons is this, you've got the fast machine called the medicine. So just a little more, more on the less necessary. And then here in this little out of the way, where there's the max of the medicine. You've got 75 people who are doing what takes place on this for help. It's a blessing. It's  the night. One of the weird things by talking to people in my school, about the possibility of these jobs, was that there were a seven-body, but they also found this on. It's  a new, they were at a step, and then go go, super-adminton business. It's  you felt that in any ways, but I've reached the jobs, not even found that. And all of the male would cover this in my school, so it was less than 100 people, patting. But there's no background. And what's more, they are the spirit. One of these people is the sexiest. And then suddenly they got an insurance function. They're about time. One of them is a great cartoon, should be said. You want them to have to be appreciated. Take a time to find their computer systems. You can start at faith. If you wonder if your computer is not the sexiest, then it's not the sexiest. Oh, the stewarder, did you forget just how to write? But they may not address and they will lose. I wish I was with you tonight. At four golden row. Hold it right there, buddy. There is something indecent about the entire premise of this week's show. This is Seraphab. Now, contributing editor to this medical line. The title says it all, other people's mail. There's an apostrophe stuck onto that word people. Now, I know that it's small and you could miss it pretty easily, but there's a world of meaning packed into that teensy little mark. It can oats the possessive case. And maybe I'm being too literal, but the apostrophe draws a line between your stuff and someone else's. Alternative titles I've considered for this, the other people's mail show are... Then you're beeswax or I got one word for you, a stopo or hey you get out of my trash. I don't mean to sound so bright, just sure what human being can resist reading over her neighbor's shoulder in the subway or looking in someone's window if it's all lit up. But I'd  to think that in a democracy, in this American life-mister glass, the words personal and private still means something. Still, I have a job to do, and my job is not to prejudge but to evaluate fair and square. So I went to Boston as a sign to visit Phil Milsky. He works as a graphic designer and lives in a normal apartment filled with an abnormal number of shelves. He's a serious collector of other people's stuff. Not just their mail, crumpled notes he finds on the street, pieces of gum, chewed by minor celebrities. and grocery shopping lists which he scoops off the supermarket floor and tastes in the scrapbooks. Here's one of my very favorites, a type shopping list. And best year at the Hav Cheese twice in a row, they really want cheese, garbage bags, beans, cheese, cheese, lice all, rug cleaner, sponge and bread. They forget to capitalize lice off, , sentence or proper name. There are 15 of them called and they, but they would be the number one option among them, but it seems much lower than the Uber. I don't capitalize anything, so maybe the, they just would do, is he to hit the caps lock, see, it's a manual type right. So I can forgive them, not father, the catless caps locks are hit, and it's meant. This wire is him goes, the shopping lists are harmless. All Phil's doing is trying to patch glimpse of another human being in the most mundane series of nouns. There is an element of strangeness that this reveals, I think. that you're really getting down into a person's real inner psyche when they drop a shopping list and there's something very raw about the way people write their things. That's part. They'll also collect those little pieces of paper you do on in art supply stores to try out the pins and he claims that they too tell him something about the inner life of random strangers. But this question is all together more magical. Even though these scribblings were created by people trying to decide to win. or pilot precise, they're done in very striking colors, many of them look  fairly acceptable abstract art. Some of them really do kind of reveal a person subconscious because when you're just testing the mark, you're not really thinking about what you're writing and so perhaps some truth might emerge that you're not really trolling. This person needs some nice drawings of pirates or something using deep-fated qualities. and some partners. They're very colorful. They're really pretty just look at person-to-a-lot music. We're kind of skating on the edge or something that some people devote their professional lives to when I'm flipping through this book. I mean especially the absolute, you said the abstract ones are the most beautiful and so be pretty. Oh there's condensed key and there's psychography and there's got to college and there. selling Franken-dollar or whatever and  but it's not I mean how is looking at these change the way that you look at no real art? I'm not sure that I do look at reward I mean I'm a sucker for these plashing marriage colors  you hypnotizing a chick it's just not that hard to get get art that appeals to me just put a lot of nice colors and learn and I'll be there if I could I might just get up I'm always been more interested in the things you need card catalogs to find than the stuff you just come across, really knowing on the street. I  James Baldwin and Pablo Paso and Sornifu. Is that it? I mean, you really think you just have what was standards or, I mean, what do you see as the common theme of the things you play? I think what interests me that. And this is almost in direct contrast to class culture and art that you refer to. I enjoy the snapshot of a moment of an average person's real life. I find it more interesting and more revealing than classical art or self-conscious art art created as art. It's hard. I just find the average person's work more interesting. Maybe it's a matter of as a person of limited ability myself, I relate to that more. What bothers you about excellence? It's intimidating. I can't relate to it. It's beyond my abilities and it makes me because you down, I want to be able to do great things. But... I've never really been able to.
