  "text": "It was Emmy who explained it best, years ago. How do  what about to have your second child? They must have been nine months pregnant already. And the daughter Maya was getting nervous about having a new sister. And Emmy said, I totally understand. She said, if Kali would have come home, it's a honey. When we bring her a second husband, it's gonna be a little younger than you. A little cuter. It's gonna be spending most of my time. Honey, don't worry. You just as much. And he said, I would see him back in the second. Siggling rivalry. Jack and Lisa had their second child. Their first daughter, Tarpa, was two and a half. They seemed totally cheerful about the new baby. Then about three weeks after the new baby was born, Tarpa was a daycare. And one of the women at daycare asked her, says, you will sister doing. She looked straight in the iron said, she stared. Welcome to WP EZ Chicago and a couple of great internationalists this American life on my regular last today on our program, Siblings rivalry, stories of people thrown together by fate to squabble in this gay boy. Back one, he is heavy, he is my brother. True tales of sibling horror, back two, trauma of the gifted child. and her sister, what happens when you're sibling is more talented than you ever dream of being. At three, destiny, a mom, records her own daughters, fighting, and what she runs in the process, at four, fraternity is destiny, story of a hundred brothers and their fates together. See you with this. Back one, he is heavy. He's my brother. What is it about our own brothers and sisters that we treat them worse than we would ever treat anybody in our entire lives? Anyone. And if you doubt this is true, if you doubt it for a second, we offer these case exams. The very meanest thing would be locking my brother to a flag call. He was changed to the flag call for sick. hours. He made me at grass. He used to play records and I knew she couldn't stand. I played them over and over again. She gets so frustrated that she threw a butter knife at me. He made me drink out of the toilet. She took my doll her name with Bini and she blew it down with Cinderella. So my brother comes up to me and he's , what's your favorite thing in the entire world? And at the time, my favorite thing in the whole world was this teeny little shell, this little tiger back to shell that my grandfather did. me for Christmas. So, , I go down to lunch, I have a tune of your sandwich, I come back upstairs, go to my room, there's no shell. And I hear my brother calling me from outside. So, I go downstairs, I go outside, and there is my brother. And he's holding the string in his fingers, the yellow string. And on one side of the yellow string is... my shell, my little tiger shell, and on the other side of the string, are my blue, helium, birthday balloons. And, , I'm standing there on about 20 feet away from him, and just opens his fingers, and I watch my shell float up into a white blue yonder. We would take that together and a lot of that time was. One time, but there was also sometimes when we would fight. And I remember exactly how it happened. I remember being left by my mother in the bath with my brother. And I cooked in the bathtub. And there was poop floating around in the bathtub. And I somehow convinced you. that it was his. They would hold me down and they would just, and they would just  spill it on you. And the forehead it was just, it was sloppy and they would just do this. They would get it ready and you could see them getting it ready and then they'd do this. And it would kind of come out of their mouth but then it stuck in back up. And then, but occasionally they would just let it go. And he would try to see on me and tell me, I- I could fly  Superman and he was going to let me test it first by jumping off the barn. Did you check that part? Yes, I think I broke my collarbone. Everyone knows this one. It's with a little brother or a little sister sitting around and you really are lazy. Don't go somewhere. You don't want to go outside and do your chores. You'll take the garbage out of the building and store. There's a little game where you say, hey Josh, you're going to go to the station. This is emergency. Hey, if you can go to the store in less than five minutes and buy this this and that for me And you get back within the five minutes time I'll time you on this watch , I'll give you whatever something close to you  my favorite baseball car over five dollars or something And they get really excited and they're oh, yeah, and you go go go and they just run you watch You watch we used to be able to watch my brother just sort of go off into the distance and he sunset running and he'd always beat the time Think it back in three minutes for me to see you always be  oh five minutes and four seconds, tough loss. Next time you're getting better, you getting a lot better. Back to drama of the gifted child's sister. That two stories, a little one in a big one, the little one first, to my brook group with an older brother who was a prodigy and violent. sister when you're younger than her. It's her. Thanks to well the Nesshe's not for saying her. Tomorrow was tone deaf. One is saying her. Didn't do it very well. She still remembers the parties that her parents would throw out and all the kids were still at grandma school. The climate, the E to these parties, would be the two of them perform. It would be, it would begin with my brother playing a really hard piece on the violin. And then my sister would be brought out. And she was an extremely beautiful. beautiful child and extremely small so the impact is all over the greater than she had it. She stepped up. I believe she had some sort of high chairs that would get into the insane. And the most amazing thing about it was I really are not conscious of who picked her up before but she had these malvina Reynolds songs that she sang and they were all very sad and cool. They were the one that would always kept the guests and served with them. and this one, I don't know what it's called, but in their X-ray, turn around and choose to turn round and choose for turn around and choose a younger, kind of how to fit her. And she would sing this song and best repeat. The such has the thing that was really quite hideous about the most and I just can't forget her before. Is the pause she took after? , I just sang in the baby for him. Still in the song. Turning round and you turn, turning round and you turn around and you go to the hand in the other younger old old town out there. And she'd have this long part before you don't. And you can glance around the room and see the tears just jittering out these people's hurt. Or you. And I think that is, that's a turning point. Turning point. in your life, right then when you realize you cannot compete with a sibling and that's probably the first time in life you learn that you cannot compete, . You're never going to do it's good. You either accept it and you're still whole or you upset them. This is the thing. These are the kinds of feelings of failure that we usually think that adults are the only ones who have to people in the 40s and 50s, 60s, and then I go, I'll never be rich, I'll never find true love, I'll find a famous, I'll never do what other people are able to do. In these who kid's going through, without all the things that adults, we as adults, have to help us get through those feelings. Alcohol, substance abuse, therapy, religion, sudden moves to the opposite side of the country. Badly considered marriages to the wrong people. it's and the facts stare them in the face. I am inferior and then  just have to deal which brings us to the second story of the set. This one from Sandra Singwell from a book A-Wayons in New York. All I know is when October night in 1976 we changed from ballet people into net cracker people. It had been  any other day. My older sister Caitlin and I had eaten the same after the snowstorm that the級 had been on everyday in堂 tadi. of a company called V8. We'd worn our Thursdayly at Tarts, Navy and White Phoenix, Orange Skaterskirt. We'd attended our usual classes at the Mari School of Dance, ballet 3 in the Big Studio, ballet 2 in the Little. Now my mother was driving us home in the same blue-forward fair-mont, and she was launching into her usual speech. A tack, Caitlin, a tack. That's what your Flette needs. A tack. Caitlin, hunched and sawlin in her park, I said nothing. At 16, Caitlyn was the brilliant one, hence the one who must often disappointed. And so she always wrote home in the front seat, the better to receive this disappointment. I was always assigned to the darkness and quiet of the back seat, enjoying vanilla finger cookies far from achievement and its many complications. What is wrong with you? You are  a noodle, lifeless. Caitlyn set her jaw turned away. Sometimes I wonder with you Caitlyn. Do you even- One of these lessons, have a nose it is not cheap? If ballet is just one big chore, you should let me know. If getting picked by a renalichinsca to dance in the nutcracker is not important to you. It was the first I'd heard of this. A renalichinsca was the ballet mistress of the famed Los Angeles Juno Ballet. A Russian expatriate, she had a glamorous if shady past. had it. She defected from the bullshy and the 50s married a Duke, lived in Monica for 10 years. She knew everyone famous at the A. B. T. Irina Lichenska was a sort of person who could take an average ballet student at the average Maori school of dance and lift her up to. If getting picked by Irina Lichenska is not important to you, my sister turned her grace Kelly Profal with its up swept bun back to my mother. No, it's fine, she closed her eyes tiredly. I will try to work on the flick-tays. What a workout we had in ballet, too, today I explain, for my position way back in Siberia. Those leaps we had. I practically broke into a sweat. Did you see Mama? Real sweat! I'm at the glance back over her shoulder and tossed me a bone. Sure, Sandra. Sure. Good. You keep trying. I certainly didn't feel I was bad dancer. At age 13, only three years younger than Caitlin. I had been studying almost as long as she had. I loved ballet. I loved what I understood to be the true dance part of it. The whirling about the room mirrors and other dancers spinning around you, kaleidoscopic. I love the tattered poster. of pink satin point shoes in the dressing room. Baleigh said is inspiration. We're Kate Lynn had going for her, as far as I could see, is good form, Passay, attitude, Air Force. They were clean. She seemed to have almost enough session with clean winds. In warm-ups, other girls would throw themselves into stretching exercises, triple pierowets, or other showy endeavors. Kate Lynn by contrast with standard front of them. and clocked through her positions. First, second, third, fourth, fifth, making the tiniest micro adjustments. It was almost mathematical,  an engineer of tweaking a modern airplane. Enterface, totally aloof. Oh, a nutcracker role would be wasted on Katelyn. I, I was the true ballet dancer. It was the day of the audition. The excitement among the 60 dance students crammed into the Mari School of Dance with mothers had reached friends in the pitch. Even the accessories were hysterical. Tira ish Swan Lake Headband, chiffon Capizio dance skirts, flashy earrings. One girl had a miniature gold toshu hanging from each ear. Irina, someone called down, the throng parted and a renalician scum merged. In person. legendary starmakers to the mirror five foot two. Her 60 something years on this planet had clearly been tough ones. She had died, jet black hair cut in the length of page 4. She had one roomy eye, right red lipstick, slash across from out. She wore an oddly managed trench coat and black boots. She looked  a baggree. Hello, I am Irina. Ladies, may I introduce Karina from behind the rena step-to-thin lip. in Audrey Hepburn-Bruinette in a wide-cream headband. She will be letting your exercises today, she as experts at the Chakadimathen, the Chakedi Method, what on earth was that? The brisk corona stepped forward to demonstrate. And a one and a two, corona path, as though we're some deep metaphysical question, she extended her right leg floor. And a one! One and a two, she replied,  that was the whole answer right there. Doing a quick relevan or left leg, beating the right twice the left knee and whipping it up to the side, the left leg spasming upward into another quick relevan before going into a depth 183 pivot. A top-silence script, the ragged semiserkull of Mari school of dancers. Haces were white. This wasn't ballet. This was algebra. Alright, come in a sec. In groups of eight. Then, eight stalwart, ballet three students step forward. The pianist began to ink her. You could feel an odd o'clock. And then seven girls plunged, daterly off in different directions, soldiers falling before the enemies gun, the chiquetti method had slayed them. But one person stood fast. Katelyn. There she stood in the center, steely as a weathering. Katelyn. The ice is a clock. She was beating the right leg at the left knee, whipping it out, doing a quick relevade, definitely moving into the pivot. Her limbs were chiseled, elegant. Clear. In that moment, I realized that what I couldn't do was that. For all my jumping, whirling, and half-split, I'd never be able to grasp that. That was the elusive thing that made one girl stand out from a hundred. It was talent. the very face of talent. The question was not which role to give to Caitlin, but how many? I'm other related this in a tumble as we drove home in the blue-forward fair-mocked. Arena had thought Spanish princess, Karina had felt they needed Caitlin to leave the Merletot, the flowers too needed help, and how about the snow queen, or maybe even Sugar. Plum Fairy. But sugar plum fairy was an advanced technical role, usually danced by someone on Lee from the A.B.T. On the other hand, if done well, it could lead Caitlin to New York. In New York was Berrishnikov. Lincoln Center. I'm other went on and on, her voice soaring, cresting, swooping. Berrishnikov, Lincoln Center, New York. These were words none ever dared breathe before in the fair lot. Caitlin did not smile, but her facing to shine in the street laughs that night. New York, I thought. New York. God. She was really that good. Irina had just one question for my mother. How are Caitlin's fothays? Coming along very well, very well indeed had been her bold reply. Caitlin's face implored it in. a hideous mask. For tase she cried out, no! that's the one thing I can't do, I always fall backwards. But my mother had an answer for everything. All you need, my mother pushed on, is a little more attack. That is all, just  I've been telling you. Why do I have to be the sugar plum fairy? Why can't I just do this Spanish dance or the Marletons? You will work on it! at home. We will do that spotting exercise in the kitchen. Every night. Oh no, Caitlin repeated, suddenly looking old and tired. Are you eating again, Sandra? I'm other turned abruptly. Yeah, I replied quickly swallowing my vanilla finger. Just a cookie? Just a couple? I didn't finish them. Sandra, you need to start thinking about just having a piece of fruit after class. You're getting to be a big girl. Quite big. Poor Sandra. Well, your grandmother always said you had good solid legs. Legs and Empire could stand on. What? I guess? What are you saying? I'm big. Do you mean I'm fat? Spot and Spot. I'm others voice drifted in from the kitchen. Spot and Spot. It was two weeks later. Caitlin had been training with Coronavirus day, drilling with my mother by night. Caitlin's big forte showed down with the arena was tomorrow. It's no use. I could hear Caitlin. reply. If you just have a little more confidence in yourself, SPOT and SPOT, SPOT and SPOT, I lounged in the dark living room. I was eating peanut butter. I would plunge my finger into the jar, lick. Plunge and lick. In 20 minutes, I consumed half a jar and felt sick. But what did it matter? I was fat. On the family scale, under the harsh glare of the fluorescence, I had discovered that I weighed 137 pounds. At age 14, it was  a weird dream. I had this grotesque transformation happened. Sandra? Oh, it was just kidding. I'm glad you get to be a flower. She sat down in the darkness with me. Are you excited? Oh, I suppose so. There are what 25 of us? I just hope they find enough pink tool in the city to cover us all. All of us fat girls have been jettisoned into the vegetable kingdom. In the hellish bulges, in the cool Darwinian pecking order of the nutcracker, only the waltz of the flowers, the lowest brung, the dew for us. Any girl at... could pull a pair of pites over her hips could be a flower. I'm going to be humiliated tomorrow. Hit him said suddenly. What? No, it's true. I could see her grace Kelly Profile perfectly silhouetted. Her words were said with almost clinical detachment. My spotting isn't good. Not yet. I think it's because my weight is hauling backward on the relev'e. It's something I have to relearn. But not three weeks. And she was right. After all, Caitlyn was the genius. She knew ballet, she understood it. But one thing Caitlyn was wrong about. She would not humiliate herself the next day. The pianist began the sugar plum fairy intro as usual. Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump. And on cute, Caitlyn went to write leg out and began her painful, but impressive Hopping. on one point sequence. If you neatly ended the phrase with a depth, skip turn, the A, to members of approval from the throng of watching students and mothers. As I love Lay Darling, love Lay, Marina called out, clapping her wriggled hands together. Two short-stag leaves done with perfect landings, the general sign, and then, weed by the music, Caitlin Buray towards the center, the sight to the dreaded frantic sequence. But instead of launching into her troms, That date, Caitlyn kept Boo Ray and Boo Ray. Her speed picked up. She broke into a run. Dolling? They're reenacalled out? A murmur arose from the crowd. The pianist looked nervously over her shoulder, but kept quiet. Because there was no stopping Caitlyn. She kept running about the studio, running, just  in Jizelle's maps. She was shaking her head. No, no, no. No. and then giving one final riveting leak, Caitlin ran out the door down the stairs and caught the bus help. I didn't have the courage to run from the nutcracker. I stayed, was zipped into my huge pink costume. Eight my sandwiches did my waltz. But I too was changed, because I'd seen that pure, stealing thing inside Caitlin. Colette character, Colette stubbornness, whatever it was, it led to the true revelation of my 13th year. It kind of integrity existed that was invisible to the world, that certain acts of courage reap know earthly rewards. Somewhere in the darkness of the audience, my sister sat, bearing her terrible burden. Knowing all, slowly I waltz with my twenty-four compatriots, our hair curled, our faces raged and bright glare in the spotlight. Centricine Lowest Storias from the Book, Aliens and America. Coming up, Luke, it is your destiny. But why doesn't Princess Leia see that? Instead of Darth Vader. Well, maybe she should. Why? In a minute. From Public Radio International. We and our program continues. It's a American life, my request. Each of them are programming, of course, which is a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, Siddling Rye for me. We'll come back three of our show. Yes, Dean. What that memo has two daughters and they're pretty typical family except for one thing Deb did some radio reporting and so she has professional tape equipment lying around the house and was willing to record her daughters fighting for our program Her daughter Alexandra is five years old. The Kayla is six and a half The Kayla believes that as the older child she should get special rights which is I would send her to the leaves otherwise and they start measuring who's ahead from the time they wake up in the morning Getting more cereal getting more juice. We get closer to the microphone I go! Stop fair! I'll let's get the microphone. Why does she have the hold when she's talking? And she holds it up to my mouth. It's not fair! Let's get a dozen gather! I have you observed it. Do Zee to them have her own style of tormenting the other one. The older one likes to control and minimize the achievements of the younger one. But in a very insidious way, so you have to really listen to what she's saying. me. she'll say, boy, Alex, Sandra, you're doing really great on your piano lessons. And if you try really hard for the next two years, you're going to be as good as I am. And it sounds superficially  she's complimenting her sister, but she's not. She's, she's asserting her dominance. Yeah. , the other one is more likely to, , just annoy the older sister, , , when out Michaela had a big meltdown, because she wanted to kill us the older one. They older one. She, her favorite song is, , sweet dreams by the uris mix. And it, she thinks it's her song. She likes to sing it. And she doesn't  her little sister to sing it at the same time. And little one knows that. And so. The little one went around the coffee table, so when it's winter, it's all made out of these over and over in the old ones. Please stop! I'm asking you can you get a beer, it's annoying! I'm sorry! I'll let you stop! I'll let you stop! No one! Do something! Wasn't it? Did anything surprise you? It's better. that would be very recent. Because I had the microphone in my hand, I became someone else. I was not, , mommy. I was sort of just watching, watching to see what would happen. And I was able to see things that I hadn't seen before. I hadn't really noticed that in the Kayla Abdicape's all-power, and that she's hardly incapable of ignoring. her sister and that her sister is so calculated that Alexander can remain in control. It's a life of a family. It did not bother Alexander at all that her sister would have just come and down. Okay, Michaela. Yes, yes, yes. You see that she knew what she was doing. she knew what she was doing. that didn't look  it never looked real  it's  it welder got a little bit wrong said and see. she was so gwing full that she got to the microphone first. she won Woissel dua Rose. What is it you're trying to accomplish when they find? What is it about the other one that's getting into the scheme? What is it about? I think it's an assertion of power, the dominance. Both of them want to be the one calling the shots. You're not a boss, man. Yeah, I'm on well. Fight for the number one spot. And there is no number one spot. There are siblings. There will never be a number one spot. They're not totally well. But there is no number one. Would you say anyways, it's a bit of a fate. But because it's fate is for each of them.

All my 98, not counting George, brother. and I recently came together in the Red Library and resolved that the time that arrived, finally, to stop being blue, but to pass behind us, share a light supper and locate if we could bear to. The missing earring will be old f***ers ashes. The Red Library walls were haunted by shadows and light cast from a f***er. multitude of low-watered reading lamps that haloed the tables on which they sat. I hate this room. It stinks of death. Whispered virgin, wedged, decide me on a love seat. Lighting up, I told him. A line of our brothers scuff past us in sorts of places to sit. A library was filling with male energy and low sounds of voices saying, a man scoot over a mixed space. Soon it would be standing room only. The mustier would grow lush with our smells of sweat, shaving locians, exhaled humid breaths. God help us. No one was altogether certain who'd last seen the urn. Jason once long ago reported a siding over near where maps of the world are stored in drawers. groundbreaking It turned out there. And sometime back, Paul suggested looking in the gloomy alcoves packed with patriotic music calls songs in their archival boxes for a search turned up nothing. It's nice to have everyone together again, isn't it? Your voice near me, sir. I turned and saw in the shadows a man bearing flowers. This man said, all the old faces, all the familiar voices. Hello? It's me, Doug. It's William. William. Don't be frightened. I brought these. He said, stepping a parkway out from darkness with pale flowers held before him. Lily's brightened the room. Yes, I agreed. Take them. Me? Put them on a table, somewhere in the light where people can enjoy them. You brought some William? Wouldn't you  to find a spot for them? Let everyone know you brought flowers? I'm sure it will mean a lot. I'd rather not. I don't think I can bear to talk to everyone right now. Maybe later. I understand this. Then he was gone, behind European folklore and mythology. and I clutched the lilies he had brought for us. In the library's open spaces men tramped singly or with buddies toward a drinks table. Others already with drinks stood drinking. They were lucky to have these drinks. By now the press are on the bar would be enormous five guys, David Lease. It would take an eternity if you get certain. Clayton and Rob would have poured the last Johnny Walker black and there'd be nothing remaining but Johnny Walker red If that or maybe four roses brand one of the gallon discounts that are admissible late in night, but which you never want in the beginning That's the way life goes around here the blinking lights that dry taste in the mouth the body's craving need for something cold and warm at the same time Out into the milling crowd. I hurled myself out in search of a suitable vase for Williams gift All in these that their long six stems, their lush drooping blooms, required a large heavy vessel. Precisely, where I could not locate. Does anyone know where I can find a vase of a whole bees? I asked a group, loitering around the native American stone tool collection in its metal and glass display case. Dennis Schraubt,  I said, sorry. Jim, who often does not speak even when spoken to, he's a contemplative Buddhist suggested, try over by the African masks. One of this was going to crash down as glass or an astray too hard on that stone tool display table and there were them mess I said you guys be careful using that as a table because it isn't designed to support weight I did not mean to school my brothers, but what can you do when people have no sense? See no vase anyone? I asked another bunch as I hurried past their leather sofa and chairs pulled up close in a circle Not me Lewis said Maybe on the mantle said drink I'll try there I said that then advised. Take off your shoes if you're going to put your feet on the furniture because you'll scuff the leather. The chandelier bulbs overhead flashed off on, off on,  playhouse lobby lights signaling act one. I sometimes imagine our red library is a kind of leak and unruly interpersonal anxiety. Emotions heat up and tempers break up. in real disputes that have their roots in a hundred contingent histories of the standard childhood competitions, degradations, reparations, punishments, torches. All the gory excitement of pain and power that seem in retrospect, so in electively linked with childish fantasies about manhood. Screaming and crying were the routine bedlam of our bedtimes, drowning out the crickets and the pounding wind outside. They've never drowning out per voices of older brothers, entanted. had enough, you little worms, father can't help you now. I held my eyes closed and pretended asleep and did nothing, night after night. It grieves me to think back now over old boyish stuff. All the bad times made more bitter and memory by the absence of this strangling reddle. library of a suene corner to hide out in. Have a comfy chair that gets enough light for reading without strength, of a taste of unstale air to breathe. Chocking, isn't it? How the dreadful circumstances of one's life, great fuel, simply because one knows them. Perfectly normal. I love the warmth. I love softness. of my brothers and I hate their dots. Me, me, our voice is all seem to shout. As if we were not a true community, and I didn't blood and spirit, instead of common mob and tint, I'm nothing more than the next mob for the people. I love my brothers and I hate my brothers. The long, snaking line of men to the bar was growing less long. Hiram's walker, cracked across floorboards. Clacked again. Sounded as if Hiram was gouging the floor with a trail. Each step brought scuffing. Hiram paused on his walker and glared in my direction. His injured hand was swollen and large. He inhaled a shallow breath. He was having trouble. His mouth was working. He said. Where did you get those flowers? William You should trim their stalks and put them in a vase or they turn brown and dye I was looking for a vase actually. There's one somewhere You'll find it He said as he gripped the walker with his good meat He heaved himself up Scoot of the walker forward on the floor took another labored step on the edge of the carpet that's not it friends that caught and it came tangled as the walker's legs Great He said, I don't know about you, but I'm famished. I could eat a side of beef, I admire original teeth. Remember always to care for your teeth, darling. I will. Do you floss? Flossing is more important than brushing, I can tell you. Too much vigorous brushing as young man was my downfall. Scrub away the gums before  at the roots of your teeth or it's supposed to be... elements and it murders you to chew. And one after another you lose your teeth  you lose everything you want. I'll remember that. Your teeth are your greatest possession. You probably think your greatest possession is your Johnson. But it's not your Johnson it's your teeth, especially you too flat teeth. These right here you said, open these mouth wide to insert viewers. He touched the teeth in question, the upper insisers. He pointed these out and when he did, when he touched these dentures, they moved. There were loose in his mouth, insecurely fast and slipping off the dome. The effect was grotesque. Hiram's teeth hanging at an angle wobbling in his mouth, lit by Hiram's tongue and about to fall out as he commanded. Let's do those flowers and vows for the petals fall off. Yes sir. There I was again in the old unconscious complicity with high rooms of authoritarian posture. This happens every time I engage with high rooms. It happens to a lot of us when we engage in. We feel in fanilized. Very Slowly. promise myself after taking orders from Hyrum that next time I'll stand up to him, not a bay, and let him get angry if he wants. Tiptoing around Hyrum's anger resolves nothing and only serves to perpetuate a strain and uneasy state of affairs in which one personality. Hyrums overwhelmingly influences the general quality of feelings and the rooms of hope. It will be going too far to imagine my own values. My carers and dispares and so on, as personalized responses to this loom wide, high-rum-centric emotional atmosphere. Could it be than follow the high-rumism self-responsible and large part, unwittingly presumably? For whatever uncomfortableness we brothers experience when we congregate. Might it be possible if in fact high-rum is the root cause of our false ph når-expressible disputes. If the bottom line is disconnected without using euc השorrow I bet there is no light or a light There was something just right Might it be possible to drive a wedge through this ancient and pervasive household trepidation? I don't know what else to call it. By meeting Hiram's anger with anger, it was in a absurd spirit of revolt against destiny. I now hurled the flowers to the floor, bore Hiram's walker. Before Hiram's feet, cage inside the walker's clackety aluminum framework and said, find a vase yourself, you say it is. Instantly, I regretted my actions and wanted, needed to recamed in beg forgiveness. Hiram leaned on his walker. He was little and bent over and liver spotted and lame, and I was startled to realize once again that I was intensely afraid. of him, throwing the flowers with nothing more than an act of self-disempowering. An emotional demonstration of the sort that Hiram would never allow himself. I felt awful when Hiram said. Pick them up. It was one of those familiar, deplorable moments. I wish that he'd dinner well. no such luck yet. In the meantime, there's the dinsal and next dinsal was saw, and next the saw, and more or less directly behind Hiram, where air and impures. And of course, there were other brothers standing around looking on, and no one among these men wanted to get too close to a fight involving Hiram. Hiram leaned forward over the frame of the walker, out over the metal frame. He had me in his sights. He said, you're full of hate, aren't you done? No. You keep it all bottled up inside your score and your contempt for people. And when you can't control it any longer, it comes flying out. We have one of our little tragic scenes. Isn't that right? No. This is a family full of love, Doug. We all love one another here. This whole room is full of love. Do you bet you can't feel it, Doug? You can't. can't participate in love because we're busy tearing everybody down. You want to tear us down and you want to discredit our forefathers. No. Don't say no to me, boy. You think that if you find sickness in others, you'll be healthy. You think if you find weakness in others, you'll be strong. That's throwing a bunch of flowers in an old man, make you feel strong, you think Doug? No. I was rude. Speak louder. No. Pick up the flowers, Doug. Then the 20 Shandaliers blinked off and everything became a shade darker. It was  a negative form of lightning, perfect company. to the routine thunder of wind hitting windows. Chuck's dog, gunner, bark, and bark. The doberman had managed to unsnarle his leash from the Art Nouveau armchair and so he was free now and sprinting in wider and wider circles around the furniture. Settle down, fellow Chuck called to the racing dog. I prayed for gunner to dash toward Hiram and knocking down. Instead, Gunner charged between couches, men's side stepped to avoid the on Russian dog Gunner jumped a coffee table, then disappeared into a narrow aisle of shelves, housing geology, natural history, and mineral sciences. I had begun a moment or two ago to describe and play in terms. The situation has disturbed that night with a little... and with high room. Our little, semi-public showdown, there wasn't in fact so little. I always charge off the track in moments  these, the bitter moments I guess you'd call them. And instead begin rendering the scenery and all the extraneous misbehavior of my brothers and their busy parents. As of anyone can't. Conflict is the really interesting thing I've found. Conflict. Conflict is always so difficult to recount. By difficult I suppose I mean painful. But also I mean demand. The technical aspects, describing true conflict or daunting. First, you have to establish more in terms. It is important to avoid cozy over-scientifications. And to bear down instead on all the obscure. and tractable problems of identity and desire to make our lives and our needs so various and disordered. The problems in describing a person are essentially problems of knowing person. One of the sad features of most close relationships is the decay of intimacy as a function of time, turmoil, and all the little misunderstandings that inevitably occur between people, leading them year in and year out toward the same. entire conclusions, conversation faulters, friendships there. That said, allow me to concede that my brother Hyrum is an incredible asshole. He's just a complete jerk. He finds your worst insecurities and then tortures you until you'll do practically anything to escape his voice's dry, reizing, and the spectacle of Bony Fiss clutching that Walker. Take a look at yourself, Doug. Take an honest look at yourself standing there with your hair falling in your eyes. You really could do with a trim and a shave. Pause, cough. Enhailed one of his bragging breaths. You need some new clothes. Those clothes you're wearing don't even fit you. Who wears a quarter-oid jacket anymore? You don't even stand straight, Doug. You slouch. You've always slouched. You have the posture of a weak person. I said to hire... The fact that I haven't shaped this weak means nothing. I only want to help. I want everyone to get along. I want all of us to be happy again. How did this sound? WOLFAL Tender. I should explain that in spite of antipathy toward our eldest brother toward his more hateful manifestations. It was still not uncommon and I believe this has been true for each of us in our relations with the man. To hope for some kindness, or gentleness, even a hint of his admiration for the odd opinion or sentiment, whatever. You see, in his presence, we felt  children. Children call. And precisely those worst moments of growing up, those times of clear, terrifying, appreciation of one's utter smalness in world. And this smalness is excruciating the field and adulthood, because it is a form of regression, therefore humanly. For this reason, and in spite of mean feelings, in spite of everything, we all crave our age to brothers esteem. He healed himself up in gas. another painful breath. It hurt to listen to him. It's a good thing father isn't around any more to see what's become of you. I walked forward two steps and abruptly, dramatically, as if swooning, collapsed before high-rims feet. I dropped my hands in knees and reached out for those broken village. Several pale blooms had come to rest directly at top high-rims large eaten by state Dson Upыхline, sculpted by state Dson Upыхline.
