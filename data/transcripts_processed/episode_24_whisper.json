  "text": "Right now this moment from the right to the natural, the eastern earth state. Schools just let out. Perfect state name. Car and the boyfriend Jeremy. Come outside. And choose for that. Roughly. Do you remember money hurting my dad? Love it. Oh, God. When I recorded this event doing documentary radio stories and car and our friends for two years, so it was natural that at this point car would just turn to me and say, I don't know, I just want it. Your Ig-U. I  this. Well, today on our program, the lives of teenage girls in WB EZ Chicago, you're listening to this American life, my request back for another week. Take your butt. Not really. Back for another week, documenting everyday stories of these United States. Using our tools of radio storytelling, documentary is month. logs, overhead conversations, pound tapes, anything we can think of. And to consider the question of what it's  to be a teenager in America today, consider this incident, to car or a Jeremy in the fence. They just come outside and if they were hurt for a school play, the cars put together based on the ratings, rerollings. And if you don't know where it can reroll and seize them, just pop star, place the sort top star strategies. It's time to support him. It's time to support him. It's time to support him. You have a favorite piece of the wrong show. Ladies, you want to call him. She pulls out the papers that surprise the show's script that she reads. And I should say here that Rollins and our 18-year-old teenager get rather graphic here in a way that might not be suitable for the listeners. Rollins in this poem says that guys are basically... Stop, basically. Just stop. It's not even this... is very on his visions, very on his feet. Because they're stuck. And he gives heart-thouder advice to all them. He addresses his ladies. You want to call you the men, so I can come to you in the mail or in your seat. You're going to have to take it, grab hold of it, rent your other hair, just grab. What I'm getting to is this. Go to the gunsmiths. Get a three-foot-to-seven magnet with a long barrel. Load it, put it in your bag, go on your pillow. OK, it's another day. You're walking down the street. You pass the gas station. Some gas station attended standing there, blaring it, you check. you out smiling at you, this ugly grease is stupid guy comes over to you and black she weighs tried a lot on the street. He breathes on you and says hey baby, we'll keep here seven inches. You pull out the guns, barrel on his face and scream, I've got eight motherf***er, I've got eights. There, now you're speaking in terms of him was surely identified with. And not only equal to dominant, believe me, it's come to this, take advantage of their weakness, they take advantage of your stereotype. The guys in the group are with each other. Finally, first of all. and Jeremy says, there's nothing wrong with the guy who's in cash. I think he's good. Prior to us, it's the point. No, they say things. So follow, they'll come up to you and they'll talk to you  this. And they'll make sure that they do that. That they're helping us. I've never seen anybody do that. You're not a woman though. I don't know. Colonel tells him a story that some guy who's staring at her in a pool hall. So when I was leaving, he went, came up  real close to me. I turned around and said, I hate rude men! Oh, screaming in the entire pond! Those men! Those men! I'm dead! Never seen a Bible, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl. I know, he's , I am a church. Mary's boyfriend, Darren, is trying to conversation. So, how should we treat girls, yes? So, that could grow. How do we better know without defending her? Right, that's almost in how should we do it? And , sometimes we don't know. And sometimes we don't know. And then  the piss of me, what is there not  that? And Martin, he looked  a planet. I'm , there's always that instinct in the guy. And if he sees something really light, he's gonna look at him. If you see a guy that you really  and what he thinks is hot, you don't sit here. What's going on here? Oh my god, that's not me. Let's just make this to me. One, two, microphone check a microphone. Wait, listen. But you're gonna say you're not good. If a guy watched by the has a real nice butt, that you  and not feel . They talked about this for 20 minutes. The boy says, over and over. What should we do? What do you want us to do? How should we do? we act over and over the girl's name, a few simple rules that anyone could follow with the pay attention. Waw, you're not a paid-a-girls personal space, so let's see in who who who who who. Aaron says that certain things wrong with Seniz Rude. If the girl doesn't , she thinks she's cute then there are people. Well, I say, if I was real, if I was good-looking, than I was sitting there saying, I'd say, I'd not do, and then if I was off, I'd not do, but how does he know that? If I was dark, maybe I'd say, okay, I'm not talking. Let's- What if we're just at the steering stage? No, no, because if you don't know somebody, you gotta go by their phone. What's striking is that there are certain moments when it actually seems  the boys really do want to know how to shoot at. They really want to know. And in those moments it's clear that this conversation will only happen in high school. They're very high school, whether it wants to be in bad discussions. It's pretty much sad. But in high school, sometimes, still a few of it, but if you can subscribe, you'll be , not be a jerk. You might actually listen. It's also a bad side. But everything up for grabs is hard to know how you supposed to pass. Which makes it to days group. Our program today is made of three schools. But teenage girls are active to say, how they're going to pass. It's situation with a ground rules or a clear, very magical. Heck one of our program, Joe Carroll appears, then it's the rules of the soft time and access. Heck two should have the ready-ready start struggles without rules. Spurbin America somewhere. Pack 3. Man tries to lay down rules for a girl. Let's do it with us. Pack 1. Texas Girl. Check out Pierce's almost Texas. Just put out a first album, H.F.I.P.1. Squarely outside of the teenager category, but she tells me to be here. She's working this really unusual stuff. on the street is called, the ad girls are set by the truth. Over the course of the record, she tells this funny, emotional story, punctuated periodically by songs. It's a version of American music theater. American cultural forms. It's kind of American musical theater that no one is bothered with, except for her. And it's the kind of city that is not going to get much radio airplanes anywhere. And so we thought it would be it. Today's show, I plan you just to chunk of this record songs and this is the story. And the story that she tells me begins the suicide. It's a teenage suicide. In real life, Jo Carroll says she thought about suicide, wanted to be 30s, and she also worked to suicide hard on. And the suicide on the record songs, during fall, before. And my boss made me drive in the lead. And all the bullets. and then you can get the song over the edge. The next few days I hope that it has turned on flow as much as the track. First I was yet by pink to the hill. Now it means the path for now to say simmer just push me flat into the bar. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I hope you've got a lot of things. Let's see if going on the boyfriend wants. Let's go. I followed him, decorated around, only moments before my fatal tone. This time, this time, this time, this time. We went home on this business, right? Scratch, this time, this time. It's good to put me at suicide when there's something to speak. But when I hit hospital and I found that, you're dead, dull, or dead. For me, it's suicide when we got a bar, I should be alone. It's not just one of these boys for and one of my stuff to do. Don't get upset about the war in Middle East. This is a deli-sa. It's good to commit suicide over small things. And it's not good. But, Grush, I can't imagine what that HME that first hit suits. Thank you. This is that first thing in the world. That way, they get rolled in.

When my husband was sitting on the bed room of the first emergency straight off that spirit and had that Jesus had set out from the so specific years. It was back last one Sunday night.

There are many Jesuses in what very morning漂亮 said, I am here. He said, but you ever even worry about keeping that beat. You just live that beat. I pretty much knew what was going to happen with boys, but I let that beat meet me and I want to know this. I asked that Jesus wanted me to go all black as after I'll eat either. So first I knew that he had that even that church wanted suggested to show that part and a very good sense. because Jesus looked later on, Joey, just looked at the morning. So what happened out there? But I wasn't my name's church. Half was just  walking on a plan. I didn't hear from Joey, but I didn't think to explain about it. Cause I had asked my question, what are these boys for? What am I supposed to do with them? In the plural, and it had been answered in the plural, and so I was real busy. But one evening, Joey threw pills. You just need some water for that, Theraphan. I have to meet him. , filmed out, well, I had not heard from him. Was he even saving up by me? Some very special. But unfortunately, the day he got it out of the way, was, , I heard you drove through the audio takeout, we didn't make it today at first. Oh, God! I didn't so relieved.

Well sometimes I can't really go. Well if you're bored there's plenty of constructive things you can do. You can raise a sheep or some chickens for the event they are joining you at the war. For girls me, how are you? No way, Joey, what did I ever do to you? You went out with Gary to you, not. Yeah. After you took Marvel and Susan home, yeah. You ruined my life and my secret you.

Joe Carroll, if you keep on  this, who will ever marry me? Acted, scrub a girl. For you listening to this American life, we're each beginning to the theme, and we're about a variety of writers, and performers, artists, and various sorts. To tackle the theme, this we've got to be, is teenage girls. And her next story is by Randy Sparks, which I'll go right to in position, for band, and some family, does the music scoring a little story. The story is about a girl who is struggling in a situation where some girls, who is a friendship, a drag, that's fun. Those girls are strict and creepy behind. But all the other girls in the girls' life are totally different. And in the world she's in she actually never worries about whether she's being good. It's that she has other words. Donnie needs scrambled eggs with tall glasses of tomato juice for dinner because we're in a dying. Donners have throw up, so she's toasting butter too. My fingers were so far down the road, and still nothing comes up. I'm a fat cow. Donnie, you're best friends. I sleep over house now, every since my step-by-calf are called me pig-feeding us cartoons. I'm ready for my mom to call, and take. me from that home, but it's very close to weeks now, I'm wondering if maybe the phone is broken. Sometimes my mom's face is on time, and she drinks a lot of green high sea with back in it. I've seen her sit down with a drink in the morning, just as open as coming on, and then it's  the next thing she knows, hard-fuck as coming on. You may step down and walk into her, screaming because she can't swim in. But I'm over Johns House now. We share a single day with the broken pink hunders. We stay up late smoking cigarettes, talking about wall with the astro-grounds between some of the sheets. Don those guys who could learn their kisses that we garage well from your hand? Other bites that last little bird's brushes on my neck for weeks, so that everyone knows it will go on and on. Don only go to the freezer, also you just want to find one. Tonight we're going to the mart to find one. Don's Mom is divorced, and Don gets called the reins of Mom. This more poor is more of a light that keeps you taping with green ester. Rain is in the shower with a new fricard and a kind of the snowing shampoo. Getting ready to go out with your optometrics she networked. Rain looks behind the counter for you, also, and they move it far away. And she gets to wear this tight, honest dress that says you are on. She meets a woman. because of that dress. Not to mention that any guy gets divorced ends up at Newhall soon or later with a sad look from his face. The rain comes out of the shower and mugs in the underwear paws. Her hair slipped back wet and shiny. In the wears red lace with a passionate heart cut out of the center so you can see the breeze hair down there. In sort of dirty blonde, even the rain's hair on top is jet black. There's a long group of scar up where you're in stomach for you that cold going out. The hot summer pass flat and tight in the voice. She needs to not have to lie to. To the hour answers, he looks  she ran down. Yes, he's seen her doubt. The optometrist calls up her question, a dog who's calm, brown, teary, and thinking was her. The rain runs out of kitchen, she's having her earrings and he's meeting on the second. She's not in dress, she blurt and shoes of things in between arms. She's blushing and crazy. the lips through the lipstick down really fast she lets the optometrist aside. Let's go, will there, unprepared to be stepping into one's house? Diamond rain says on her give the voice that's safe and then on and I'll be home late from that at all. Diamond or dry? Watch it now young lady. Okay diamond moves, I'll feed the fish. Okay, Lorraine, we have a time which is says, let's say. See through, okay? Just give us a text is on it. They head out to the car and drive away and they work crying, to give you that scaping old guy in this hands on the raised perfect type body. Then I remember, going to be around at one of them. The sit down, the kitchen table, the knife cigarettes, the drink half glass each, the rinse and sink into the wine, because more than that she knows this. And on this, I can't wait to get a place to know. I'm going to have him free just pink something down and powder donuts the seven of Don't lose powder donuts because they're the easiest thing we've walked to all up Tonight we're off to the mall and hunt the babes don't sense if she falls in love with the mall She'll go out And leave me hanging by the fountain ice cream? No, she says plug in your feet and then it'll be a bit for you too We'll find two babes and follow her when they can take us to the pit Don't's going to be a tourist which he graduates has come for work at the U-Haul very I'm going to both of the beauty academy and the club dance and I get out of the world so no one will calm you back down the calm you now silence I have a new makeup stick in dark coral pink I put it on above my eyes  a saline beauty diggers Don't put it on your cheeks and your eyes on lips and brunciana She reps the stick and must going to use Mondro are I'm feeling the wind with the smell of a jungle. I fly on the bed next to each other, as if they're cheese. When I stand up, as you roll with fat on the waistband, so we borrow a loose sweater from dawn, something with drawstrings of the bottom. Dawn is straight and thin, whereas padded bras that make tiny puff breasts under her shirts. I wish I could throw off my car. We each swallow four of our main sex insurance into her lidosis, and then fluff her abs and look  wild animals. You only take one each of the reins well in it because there's a chance. Can't let you stop at Sears. We go into the luggage department, straight into the bathroom. Don't this look where your hair turned out? So she wets in the sink, kneels under the hand dryer, when the young child's warm to do it over. I look at myself in the mirror. I hair and nails are perfect. I know how a cocky the looks, and my cheeks are full and red. That how sharp they're doing. Tomorrow I'll eat nothing but tuna sushi in one. We walk out to the pensions you want me to find. and his part-kow and gale. Even through two stories down I can see Carol's last weight and won't be stopping jealous. She was always a punch  me and she had to go with the clinic for abortion and she threw up for two days after the anesthetic. It makes me wonder why no one sells anesthetic to pack people for a dying. I guess that's where you can stall all, still isn't fair. Two weeks before Carol went to the clinic she said Jean, walk with me to the gym. So walk with me to the daily and go to hands. with a little man and he could go to the cross-off and shoot him away. Carol got changed for the phone. She called the clinic and said she got raped and more than morning after pill. This was true. Carol told me about the moment down the pit. She was gotten wrong and finally got off her and she had to squat and search for a full minute before she found the river. It didn't matter anyway because the clinic said she had to tell the police first that she got raped. So Carol hung up and felt  it's down and jurors pick a cold wound. crying her eyes out. When I tried to put my arm around her she said, you smell hamd in ee. Push me away. I'll care. Dolls and best friend ee. Donnie and Caroline Gale are sitting in front of the fountain reading for babes. Gale's beautiful and goes out with Jake and Soma as a roll bar and his truck. And while blonde hair  a rock star. But he's at some traction going in the city today. So Gale is at three 8 minutes. I never told- But I have a secret about your kissone. Once I walked by sheer impact, and I such a was sitting under a dryer and comb my eyes in his hair. It may be one and even more, seeing the plastic sheet over him, the white towel on his neck, and doing any yellow comb rust cover he's head  helmet. Any guy who thinks he ought to try and look at, even if he's a babe already, is gotta be sort of sweet. I wouldn't sheath on him just because he went to the truck show and found me. Bye. I'm not beautiful  Alan the Rosendiffin. Tonight, Gales' dinner eyes in blue liner, her hair soft blonde curls her shoulders, and she's long with thin pink cords and black sweater that shows a beige brown under orangey-lessy hands with her hair back. It's hard to believe her both girls. I've never come close to looking anything  her. What's up she says, throwing your cigarettes in the fountain. There's the hiss as flame is water. Nothing don't says. How you feel on your scalp? She gives me a look. I'm standing at gals. Do you need to think of my house don't says? How come gals suddenly interesting thinking something's up? I can't predict anything. Mr. Father's a scam guy say. They're going feeling alone to cry being a sin of attention. There are scams galses. My stifoes stop 10 bucks. my first letter. Darn Zellball sings into my side. Babe, she was crazy. There they are. Oh. Do you need a dawn? Make their moves for the days. In minutes. One up of. It's a American line. Many sparks, stories, scanx, continues. I'm going to remind you that some scenes in language in this story might not be suitable for Yi other speakers. Don't, Jeannie and the friends, follow us, Jeannie and Bench, bye. Three guys turning the corner from monkey wolves. We lean back with our toe stretch out in high years. I can feel the water spray against my back, but I don't move. Waste my jeans looking ironed down. I can hardly breathe. Don't stand. Jeannie, let's go. You just sat down, I say. Look at that baby in the red leather don't says. He's checking me out. Can we just sit here a while and say, to need, do you want to effect how all your life don't say? The blonde one isn't bad. He's got long hair, let's go. You go after the baby. The start around the corner of Camelhoff, the long pink one is sticking on their back pockets. The blonde's right. They have to do something in life. We follow them down the North corner of the mall. I watch David and David when he's then hips-changed. His then hips-changed. back and forth and take my things. In myself slowing and getting it done so. You're going to our studios and often fast on high years behind. Two by my jacket my chili dogs put the red leather best for us. The chance is a sports catchup and use these unbelievable sea greeners. I feel a better front coming right in my stomach. I can almost come out to build and welcome. Of course not softer than the gonads or gonads even. What's up the baby? Steering down the floor. Smile and assist in the white, clean up commercial. His died black hair brown loose. Nothing nonsense me, you. Try and give the boy me the. Please, worst, closer. His hair is long and hangs black in the size of his face. His body is round and squarely going well. Feel my soft long nose or state as my jewellery. and it can see from the space on just as I'm peeing to you. And then it meets my They slide into the booth with the ruined fries in the chamber across the table. We all chees fries at the corner through Subchees off fries and you can go back and play Wait I suck on with five fries Don't subsden practically hopefully She can She's already thrown up twice in his breakfast Time to get and she's inspired and lets her to do it. Hey, babe says, hey, don't say it. What's up, you says? Nothing she says. You want to hang out? Sure she says, I'm done, this is Jeanine. Hey, you saw it from the came out way for the first one. She definitely paid. Time, time, time with how she's scratching. Listen, don't say it. We need to wait for the baby. She gives her love. Perfect. eyes and lips. She named this checking egg for anxious. A blind guy, she's in love with him for something. Let's Stevie the babe says, he's cool. Babe stands, pressing his hips into the edge of table. Dawn's fingers strip the table time. Now, her pink shells click against the table time. Cool, she stands, brushing against the baby, she doesn't look good. There's the sizzle of Bible, please. We meet you by nasi, she says, and struggles fast upon its joys, and in fact, it was the serious death. I felt very deep in that. I felt a little bit more in the bathroom, I opened my eyes twice, passed by, feeling tears beating up the edge of my mascara. I keep the leaves gone. My voice is heavy and scrap. Telling that guy it was hot for a scan friend. He's all right, Dancer's. I'm going to the hospital for the thing you do. He has long hair, what's with you? I don't know where I hang with him as well. I press my index finger to check the corner of my eyes. Tips of my fingers are black with my scaring tears. There's a nose at the back of my throat that wants to come out. And I'm not done with my neck. This doesn't feel as huge. But it's can't be boring whether that's there. Let's meet him too. no worse than some of the others at night. Snuck a Wilson so every day it dawns on its escape you looking best flown along. As people see a little dark on me. I've noticed how beautiful people  to have escaped flound hang out. It makes them look even better. Oh man, Dawson's, can you my best friend of what? No, I am. My voice cracks in hand. Careful. I wipe away the black tube and down my cheek with it and collapsed. But the victim's I just don't want to be with that guy. This is stank and . I really comes into the bathroom carrying a shotgun gun. She goes into the stall. Don't do as a hand dryer or else you can do the laundry. Not on the space. If you're my best friend, they'll do this for me because I tell you one thing for sure. Only my best friend can save upon my house. Just stand there, weep it. It takes forever again. Please. and let's go. You did on the call back in brush powder for some chicken. And then you do more mascara on that. I work quick. No one going to leave me behind and leave her. I want to come see what little one. Talk at ice cream, smear down his cheeks. She lists not to the sink in the statistician white space. I want to go away. I want to be chubby. I want to go away. I want to be chubby. Look, don't say that you need to go with something. You don't need to do anything. I just don't want to be alone with the guy at the first time. Stick together at home. And later, when we get home, we eat some eggs or something. Okay? Not my face is gone with you. I hope my eyes won't taste any of this game. I told it for a while. And move the shot and take them from now, O she's here. looks at her something new. She slides her lips together and then another lipstick. She's pretty fling all lady. She must get these 40. It's depressing to think that all the years are not to worry about the makeup in my hair, for you get all of them in your cares. We leave the bathroom, head to Macy's and Nilea, waiting for those pancakes. Dave sees us and calls a wig cooking on an American to show off. Usman, the skin's tight, layers. out of one of you needs it. And you can film a face warm for tonight. Hey, what's up, the babe says? This is my buddy, Stevie. He's cool. Hi, I see. Then my lips up, he's just something  a smile. Darling's giving you a hand, . What's up, Stevie says? Besides a crooked and small. We head out to the parking lot. Let's dark out. Headlights reflect off cars, and walk out to the strip of grass, and separate the whole week. the basis parking lot. The green bushes are planted in the world lead up to the entrance and exit signs that separate the leaves and traffic in their places. Dying meaning gives the answer. Steving the baves then cross-miss. The bavars planted suddenly come. Passes it around. Always warm. Trying to square them to my arms. So the baves is finding. What's up? I'm cold on this. Here he says. It takes off his leather, perhaps it around her, leaving his arm or shoulder. Certainly they're going out. She falls because the enter sign with a bang, and I remember way quickly as he presents him to him with his hips to chest. I look at Stephen past him at the car stream by him highway. He makes him loyal as he's throughout the Spit some grass. What's up, he says? Nothing for say, looking down. He puts his arm around me. Babe has a hand up, don't sure. I catch a corner of her ground, use her hand. Steveys hand crawls around my shoulder, so I can tell you from seven months. Babe breaks away from Don and means it. Time to hit the bit. Don looks neat, come on, Jeanine. Shake my head. She puckers your lips. You go behind the eggs at some. She's sweaty. I make that rising  film over her face. Jeanine, you want to place this sleep tonight. Boises There. friends. It's dark in a bath that I just let my mascara run well with tears. I know Don can sleep, but she just flips her hair and steps back away from me, talking loud and guys to be there. You think you can do better, she says? I look at her. Even when we went from the cars and the sweat on the face, she's still something I'll never be. In the tiny poles of your shoulders, the long sweep of the legs down to our ankles,  glass bells on how you use. I give you. Across the highway, take the path down to the woods because it's just over a branch made up to the dirt to make the cement for the wall many years ago. In pine trees planted along highway, going tall to block out the streetlights and below, stick with bushes to try to pet into the rock camp in some of the weeks. Keep your hand in your dark to fool around. They do drugs, high cops. Stivia's hand in my ass. You whispers in my ear. You can have a nice body, okay? Babyn darn disappeared into the woods. I call her name, but she will answer. From up the hill I heard truck shifting gears. On one, some guy screams, Dildo. Stivia says, SHHH LATS We walk further into the pit. At! in the dark outlands and covers against trees, a golden saw and a new dirt. We find a clear area with a overturned shot and caught on the Stevie's Sith. I go to the next one, but he grabs my head tight over my ears so that everything sounds an ocean, behind the wall and he really musn't. I love you. Yeah, I really love you, okay? Pushy me down to my knees, pushy more face into my zipper, and then there's the smell of you. Get me through these jeans. I barely musn't be the same before. last of times because it doesn't know that the water in this my boss can and last of times I thought maybe a guy might be , most of the stuff just open me up and make it done, call me, go home. This time you can't seem to, this time you're pretending you're doing it for done, I can do this so, for any reason at all because this time I can see so many done is getting tired of me, even if I play this right, it's deep. I'm leaving, and days are numbered as a best for you. I open my eyes after a moment the gold thread along the zipper of his jeans appears. The tears are running to my mouth. I make a pusher. I try to try to suit my son, my best friend. I try to keep my face pressed against his zipper, but I can't. When this hand comes down and embutons his jeans, I pull away and stand up. You're scared, you're so sick. Hey, says, come on, help me out here. Can't leave me  this. It's killing me, okay? I call for Dillon, but she still won't answer. So I turn and start back up towards the road. Hey, Stevie, you're on the rag or something? I'm leaving Dillon and you help one last time. I know if I walk back to the mall, we're doing some big awful. And now as soon as I stop at these roads, I won't have a best. I'll get lost that girl Stevie yells from behind me. Then after a moment of years. It's your loss, okay? I start to run. I run about the woods and cross the highway and through the lines of Park Cars and into Macy's. I run through lingerie, pantyhose and piles of scars. I run to the center of the mall where I stop, with the burning cramps squeezing my eyes. I'm thinking about that stomach, covered in sweat. Don's got swear. You stand there, panting, they face aching the dried tears. No one seems to notice you. The binge is by the founder Empty, something tells me that Lost Dawn and Lost Galen can't tell you. Lost all the girls say the Don's wants to eat this one. And while alone we need no words to do. Don't add the knees, and by two slides. I just had to go home and go ask them, I mean, I need as fast as I can with one breeze dripping down my neck. I thought birds were swallowing some fast. Inside the sewers bathroom and two bros of the sink. I don't bother. I mean, go as I head back near those who are much greater than hair. Best friends. When they see me, one of them reaches out, turns on hand-wrench at me. I can go to star near everybody,för hand movement between people and them. The other hand turns into nine. Stick it down into my throat, to my stomach start to shake, and my mouth aches it in the pizza, rushes back up, you down, splash in the phone. The hand drive fits on. One of the girls says, Lisa should never wear yellow. You notice that? She looks  a frog in water. It's weird. I mean against the wall is strong. I had to catch the golden, my stomach was thin flat and then I looked deep right there and just for that one moment between letting it out and throwing myself up again. I'm a little beautiful, and the puzzle piece was sliding into the bed that's gone when I first So I will complain about it. Thanks for spending the sparks, music was about hands. I am a girl and by me that's only great. I am proud that my solo ends curving. That I walk with this weekend or maybe with my hips kind of swiveled. I adore being dressed in something freely when my day comes to get me out of place Out I go with my joy, jonder Billy Billy who is ready for the race When I have a friend with my eyelashes all I've sloped as the clouds on airdune I enjoy being a girl When men say I'm cute and funny And my teeth are teeth vapour I just left I'm so happy to be here. Act 3, Good Girl. Well, our problem today about teenage girls comes to a close with this last story. Lady of music, very quiet. There's no such thing as a truce. The story is called, this mindless thing. And some content in this story may not be so young or less. So I was going to say this. See, this was it. Oh, no.

So,전에 was  a blessing. And now I was sitting there looking, I was always moving into his little body. And he was very aggressive. across it. just so it gives me an interest to take off. I saw a scene of thinking, the door was locked. It was a locked. I didn't see it. I had a little sister in the space room. So eventually I found this was just my friend. And I saw it. And of course I want to see it. We both see that we look at it. It's wrong, it's not true. I don't want to. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
