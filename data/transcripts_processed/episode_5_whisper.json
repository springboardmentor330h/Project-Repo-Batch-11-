  "text": "Pyotriglass brings in 2006. And the show that you're right to listen to, the fifth episode of our show, we actually cannot find master copy of it. So what you're going to hear is a copy of somebody's old cassette this show and your politics. We all know what liberalism will look , back in the T-Day, back during the Kennedy administration and the Great Society. We all can see it. There's this preceding Kennedy. house long and sweatshirt playing touch before or picking up hearts while playing fish before. He's turning toward the camera this little film of sweat on his forehead and he's smiling and working just radiate sexual charisma. The native liberalism meant a nation increasingly. Ope of that sexuality. It was a time of rising sex on ads and sex on television and increasing sexual practice into society in general. Now, in our current moment of the Republican Revolution, for a nation that is increasingly getting in touch with our anger. programs. 2000, 5000, but not this one. Because of WB EZ and Chicago. Do you already apply house? Am I a glass? Wasn't very Saturday night vibe. I got so excited when I did it. I just I I barely understand the call letters I've had. It just in case you were fun WB EZ. That's, , so man, just call me up. That's important to them. Anyway, tonight, on our little radio show, Civilization and its discontence, and the people who are discontent with the discontence. And if that doesn't make any sense, just stay with us. Can you just stay with us? Coming up in our program, stories from Larry Steeger, Iris Moore, Cheryl Trick, and one more more. So anger, anger is an inherent part of the current conservative rebel. It is built into it from the start. It is front-loaded. It is in the hard-drive, hard-wire mechanism of the thing. In the 1980s, whip- and Newt Gingrich was making video tapes and audio tapes for Republican candidates who were trying to win office and Newt was trying to convince them to win office in the way that he had. That was very successful in building the Republican majority as  this way. One of the things that he told them was to consciously use words and phrases that would polarize the political debate and that would get people white. There was recently this past October there was this huge. profile of his political strategy in the New Yorker. And as appointed up, the recommended words on these tips, the recommended words that candidates were supposed to use as often as possible and referring to Democrats included these words, sit, traders, corrupt, bizarre, cheat, steal, devour, self-serving, just getting the music ready for this dramatic moment. setting up self-serving and criminal rights. See what's in that worth it? Where am I going to be? Sick Traders corrupt bizarre cheats steal Devour, self-serving and criminal rights. What if it's possible to use others in one sentence? I'm just looking at words here. Sick Traders, I guess I get a democratic with their corrupt and bizarre ways, not only cheat and steal and devour, it's not a great interesting set. All right, I'll tell you what, we are a radio program. And we have the power to do the following thing. And I'm just going to stop the music. Yeah, there we go. This is such a dramatic moment here. All right, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to get a piece paper and test. I'm going to redo these words and we'll give you the address of the radio show at the end of the, at the end of the program. Whoever can come up with an interesting, grammatically correct. sentence using these these words win a valuable prize right here the words okay sit traders corrupt is our she people over the city are just  cursing me out now go slower steal devour self-serving and criminal rights and the winner will get and pop them up well See it in some congressional district yet to be made. I can now let's just be fair here for a second. Just a moment of fairness. Hold it in angry, almost. The voters is not just a tactic used by conservatives. I would say pretty much the last, oh, , a hundred years, let's call it an even hundred. That's going to pretty much remain state strategy of the last two. I think it's average. Except when the lab does it is the code to the outrage at the rich is Which as we know is we're different from our current political That  the same New Yorker profile Basically outlines this whole political strategy To cultivate anger of middle-class people against The poor not against the rich but against the poor and against social programs for the poor At one point in this article one of the consultants who holds seminars for House of Publicans of the Education speaker-gingridge. It's because something tells the reporter, alright, I'm leaving the article. Sphitting his words and gesturing angrily at his chin, and talk says, the middle class has had it up to here with the arrogance of the poor and the disenfranchised. And one thing that is particular about the current moment in our political life as a nation is that people are angry. But they're not angry at things that are happening to them. , what they're getting paid, conditions at work conditions, down to factory. The garbage pick up on the street. This is the what this particular political revolution is trying to instill. This particular revolution is trying to instill anger at welfare moms. People are angry at the old jailer. They're angry at people who they never met. Which brings us to the Susan Smith class. I know it's coming on secret. Just just write with me here a minute. I know a lot of you are working on your words, so this would be a time to really pay attention. This isn't the thought is this grizzly grizzly gaze. And to review briefly, in the small town of Union South Carolina, Susan Smith locked her two children, very green to her car, and then sank the car in a way, supposedly to help her keep this rich boy friend. Who's supposed to? did one thing, did my heart have kids. And really hard, fine. Story. And one of the contributing editors to this radio show, Jack in, is he's from South Carolina. And he's a journalist, he's an editor, he's been an editor anyway, Harper's next. Freakens the tribute to New York Times and S. Guyer another person. And over the course of the students met trial, he traveled home to South Carolina a number of times. And watching the coverage on South Carolina television. He said that what struck him was the pure rage that people had to assist him. There he is talking about it. What does Talon do with River Park? Baby killing bitch, I remember hearing a woman on TV shouting at the time of her lungs. People were sending in their milk money to help defray the cost of electrocuting her. Perhaps the most horrific thing was to see this town of good Christian gathering at the police station, the war which was first brought out for hearing. Then the crowd actually... right, the demons try to get there. The demons have a lot of arms to stop the ground ripping her part. And she says, and this, he said that this reaction is understandable. It said when he first heard about this, it's a good man cold. But he said the thing about this anger, was that he'd never let up. He said that weeks, when by week after week, and it just stayed at bigger force. And Jacket said that, at that point, you realize that this is difficult. of a certain kind of conservative. Today, this is a political style for good or bad that we see in a water in our country right now. Every time you tune the men, whether it's, , the maglocal and group on Sunday morning or whatever, they're still curious. They're just angry, angry, angry, angry, angry. And once the Susan Smith trial drops off the radar, they go pick up something else, it'll inflame their anger so they can move on and hate something else and be angry, angry, angry, and somebody else. So take a look in our article for the Washington. first. She's not it. And in this piece, he argued for a different kind of response. He was in this room. What he said was, said, sure, she should be fine. So the ultimate, she punished and severely. But he said, even in this case, even in the case, so horrible that no one could possibly sympathize with the cripple. No, what could he work for mother, killing her two young children? He said, even in this case, we have to have the anger have to turn to an attempt to understand why she did what she did. And she forget. He wrote in his piece. If there's one aspect, the old liberal, she needs to bring its ex-communication. It's the willingness to contemplate, even the most horrific, and to seek to understand why it can happen. What we understand is we come to know students met more and more and more. Rather than being the story of a sort of liberal. teen promissuous woman who wanted to have her way and wanted to have her rich husband. And therefore, , killed her children, so she had this husband who didn't want to have any children. It became a much more complicated story, less of a cartoon story, more of a sort of human story. And let me just give you that very briefly. Her mother, Linda, was married to a fire, and eventually divorced and married sort of richer, Beverly Russell. And after. a few years when Susan's 13, she tries to kill herself. That happens, it passes. When she's 16, she goes to a high school guidance counselor to say that her stepfather is the Russell. I remember the Christian coalition, and I were public and county chairman, is a musical Russell comes in. He basically admits to this. Mom says, I'll handle this. We don't need to go public. We don't need to bring any charges. I'll handle this at home. Nothing happened. And everybody went back home and went back to what they were doing. We now know that Mr. Russell. want back to of using a stepdaughter. A year after that Susan tried to kill herself again, , was institutionalized. After that she graduated from high school, she gets pregnant by this, , your man has the first to the two boys. And finally at 2823, she commits this, , unspeakable act. So the softest piece of publish in which jacket urges that we try to understand and forgive. And , a writer wants to have him back. and after this happened, he's doing that. Check it, he noticed one significant in the general mood. What he noticed with that, someone who's directed at me. His outfit is generated, his huge response got lost, your useless approach is and he's just a punching bag, talking to me. All just ripping in. Now people who write letters to edit her. about a piece  that. They usually do not get much satisfaction. , you're lucky if you get published all when you write that. And if you are a published, you usually end it and you have no nose, what will happen to you. But because so many people disagree with that Jack, we thought that we would get one of them to share. Here, to discuss it, direct. So we invited one of the writers from Tom Bond. We think this is a radio first. At least we're going to say that. We have never heard anybody doing. And so from now on we're just going to repeat that for the rest of the show. This is a radio first that we do. The person that we chose, letter, letter name Greg Rips and he's an attorney in Washington, East. And what he said. In the Zardartha, they speak a jacket overstated the need for forgiveness and understate. It means punishment. First of all, it may be that forgiveness is a pretty low priority here that what we have is a situation where somebody, to some degree, has placed himself beyond the realm in which we really should be worrying too much about that. Of course, it's a horrible story since its life. But there's gotta be a limit to where you forgive them. her stepfather came in and said well I was abused as a kid too and that's why I had the path on the cycle of abuse to suit would we then have to hold out forgiveness to him as well can I say something I know yes I check it yes I was the root guy I would say you you should in fact  this is an entire religion found on this concept called great yeah and yes I'm this root guy would say that  one way perhaps to break the cycle is to is to speak of forgiveness now I say that all in the context of this is not the equivalent of clumsy, forgiveness and clumsy are two different concepts. Forgiveness does not mean we let Susan Smith go or that we eliminate the need for punishment. It goes without saying that she deserves it very least a lifetime in prison, at the very least. And I say that is a liberal, people who do bad things need punishment and we need to punish them. Break me through. I think what a lot of people are reacting to here is that the liberal view that was most popular in the 60s, it's not inherently necessary for a liberal to take, is sort of a denial that there's evil in the world. And with Beverly Russell, I think what people see is they see that that's evil and also a student's met. Now one thing to keep in mind with students, that is, the country saw her several days on television, cheerfully talking about her babies and how they had been. taking away by a black man. And I think that that's stuck with people, that what they realized was this was somebody who not only was able to do it, but who was able to do it, and then try to get away with it. And that that just not indicate a person who really is deserving of a lot of sympathy. Check it. Really, my article is not about suicide. It's about you and me. The punishment issue, you're right. It's about suicide. She deserved to be punished. My point is that the whole idea of forgiveness is about us getting beyond this crime. Otherwise, we all, of course, as I think, many conservatives would  us to be stoking our anger for the rest of all time, so that we can hate this woman forever. And really, my piece is finally a kind of secular statement of what, , Christianity is. That's why I was sort of alarmed that most of the people who reacted with such fury, had might. were themselves, , alleged Christian? Let me answer this for you. I mean, do you find persuasive anything in which Jack hit says about this notion that yes, of course, this woman should be punished, but in the case of her and the case of her stepfather, the point of Christianity is that there needs to be empty and confused. Well, obviously, I don't want to be in a theological dispute, but at the same time there's nothing necessarily bad about people's outrage, that's it. Jesus also said, , what you do to the least of my creatures you do to me. And that's not, it's not true that everybody who has a bad home life or who comes from a situation where they were abused has to turn around and do the same thing. And in fact, with a lot of people, I think recognizes that the forgiveness culture does not encourage people to choose the right path. It doesn't encourage people to act well that we may be better off in a culture that asks more of people. Part of what you're saying is in your... letter, if I understand it right, is your impatient with the notion that we should try to understand people  Suspice, and we should try to be a competitive man. I get sensitive, you've had enough of that. Well, there is something  that because the thing is that there is a history here, there's a history in which crime has not been taken as seriously as it should have been for many years by a lot of people who've placed themselves on the left of the political spectrum. And that really I think is what people were reacting to. of strongly when Michael DuPakis had that famous line when he was asked what would happen if his wife were raped and murdered and he essentially responded that he would increase drug education in the school. That people realize that there is a history here where people do see that that may well be where the flea. Checking great regret is arguing essentially that too much forgiveness and no shit of too much forgiveness is dangerous for a society that is that people are seen. to take responsibility for our actions. In a way that you can do what works. I would agree with him on that. I agree that I don't want the idea that a forgiveness can mean that we let people go. My argument is that we've sort of the pendulum is so far in the direction of punishment. That's all we do about jails, jails, that's the only esciosition that we play. There's a local statute which is passive. Anybody under 18 who gets in trouble, the parents and everything. It's the remedy for everything. But it seems to me that they, , for us to do. be able to contemplate the bad things that people do and the horrible things that happen in our culture and then to be able to move beyond that requires that we find some way to comprehend and understand these terrible things that happen and I think that the idea of forgiveness is the right way to go. Let me turn to great-great-great-great-great. Well, Mr. Glass, I mean what Mr. Head says is he says, well, we shouldn't keep it. Keep being angry at this, but I don't know that it's a bad thing. It's something terrible. been done to stay angry at it, not to let it fade in our mind, and I don't think it's selfish to do that when it's a bad thing that has been done to somebody else. I  to think that I wouldn't be jaded that I wouldn't, that when I hear something terrible, that I will continue thinking it's terrible. And that's frankly, I thought, okay, did you being angry about it? I can't disagree with you more. I mean, the people who are angry at that courthouse and who are still angry, and that's not my point. They sort of dig themselves into this rust of anger and never get out of it They just stay there in a constant rage. There is no other choice  I say Susan Smith drops off the radar this week. No worry Jack here is a writer now living Connecticut Gregory Booth Her name was That's her another model right a considered special punishment You can also be sitting at Shop station that's the хочется This questions вроде ausge people go with the options of trying and saying, well, sure, I did whatever. And whatever. Yeah, sure, I did that. I had a reason for our classmates and I had a reason for my parents' efforts. Beverly Russell said, no, no, no. The box stops here. He said that I actually used his step-up all those years. I knew it that. He said he was guilty, not just for what he did to her, but for what she did to her. This testimony is said. You don't have all the guilt in the strategy. That one's five. He said, had it been true to you and my response to it. You had been stronger in yourself. I needed to constantly support it. Reassure it. My heart breaks for what I've done to you. You're a pain block. Had I known at the time the result of my step, but of my step, my response. I said, how is sure that puzzle count in CPW? In that town, 75% of the residents have agreed to the jury's decision against debt. In the country as a whole, further away from human reality, 75% of the population should get. I'm sorry for what I've done. I realize that it is pring... mature and also at a very late stage in the game for me to become a fort. But comfort is an action which should take place. I apologize for being taller, person city, kind me. I apologize for being smaller, person city in front of me. I relinquish nothing and every thing in order to stand here for you. That this I apologize for. I do not believe that this will allow me in November. into any new situation without the remembrance of what I've done. I only wish for you to hear me. I apologize for this also. I'm sorry. I've brought shame on my family. I've caused anguish, hurt, pain, suffering, and other families. I've done things which have not been done. Without naming names, I have provoked qualified just. I've revoked, interred, summoned, question, realized, created, allowed, returns, figured, situated, and muted things I should not have. I will allow for a return of the things that I think. They are not mine. They have never belonged to me, and if they could all be restored with new knowledge of me ever possessing, for adjusting them, I could regain, putting, how holding in this world. but I do not wish it not belonged to it. Find misunderstood you have only made a blind. I do not warrant this voice. I give this back. I do not hold this ground. It is not mine stand on. You are hearing that they only think I have left. And I apologize for this. It is not mine. Every time you say My body's resistance breaks in a column from the surface of my skin to the own. But I forgive you. I forgive myself. I forgive my past. I forgive my pain. I forgive my man. I forgive everything until any terrible blame. I have no memory at all. Oh, question, have been answered. The singlet has been found. Oh, let's forgive him. Come home. Format Sardis, Iris Moran, Larry Steeger, Larry Steeger is based on the testimony of serial murder of Jeffrey Dahmer. Terry Dioplasm WVZ Chicago. Now, this is Arthach. Love the forgive. He's called Cherokee. Hey, I don't blame you for leaving me, especially since I drove you to it. But can you really blame me for my part? I was just born to his stupid, I don't know my own heart to tell a truth. Can't the blame really be late with the creator? Who made this world without him? It's his original sin. This world in which you and I are living apart. Oh, blame! God, he's only one of Rich's one after my God, mess  this and even he can't believe it. I'm a blame God. I didn't do this by myself. I had to find a system. I'm a blame God. Yeah, I know you were true of all those things Jesus Christ told me to do. And I don't blame you for blaming me for all this pain. But the things that I did to try to not kill you. I know we were meant to be together internally. And we would be if it went for him. I was a bit more saying that I am Jesus. original seeing not mine his world which you and I live in a part I play God He's only want to raise my heart to make a mess  this and even he can't clean it up I play God I didn't do this by myself I had the van assistance and I play my family God! I  God! He's only one original after my job as slackness And even he can't quit it! I've played God! Why you're having to be a deity of this pain? that's just not me! I've learned God! God! Come onミ, questa front design boy neighbor I'm gonna be a comeback Remember me Well, the views expressed in the music on this program are not that. the BBEs and the E. So whatever you think of this notion that our society needs the less rigid and we need to be harshable. So they do what's right. But if you think about this philosophical, you have to acknowledge that practical consequence as social problems. These kinds of ideas are basically read to a dramatic content of many criminal issues, many states. We've seen a state over the last year. of the last few years. Increases in mandatory sentences, accountability laws, lots of laws, trying juveniles as adults when they commit to it. And in certain sense, these laws are work. The murder rate is down in many big cities, in Punish, Kago, in New York. The prison population is skyrocketed, people are being taken off the street, more men are being locked up, more. But to get a sense of some of the human concept, of here's down there and about, supervising the term, it will be published. And it's a young man now, I say, for the record as names, JB, 13-year-old who was awarded the court because his mother was the substance of youth. His father was nowhere to be found. The only one who embraced this young man was the game. Dope. 13 years old began selling narcotics and Hi, I reglass here talking to you again. Remember about 30 minutes ago. I said that this is an old cassette copy of one of our programs Well, this is actually a point in the program where the person needs to flip over the cassette and and that the happen is that you're going to be at the side. Apparently, a word or two got cut off. And we think the word that got cut off is the word, someone. So I'm just going to say it right now. Someone stole his narcotics, his life was on the line and he was threatened it is. You do not even get the money, the drugs, or get the individual who stole the drugs, not only will your life be in jeopardy but just sisters life would be in jeopardy. And basically surviving, ZB pulls a trigger, takes a human life. And yes, he should be held responsible for that. But the way we air, we were not concerned and compassionate enough to understand why. It took place. And during that we sent a 13 year old boy to the Delta system where he was sentenced by judge who was elected official to 55 years. Treated as an adult and being treated as adult. See even a Delta. JB is now 15 years of age. JB. will be in his late 30s, early 40s, I believe when he's released with no hope of receiving a job because he's a convicted felon, convicted of murder, that record will follow him forever. And if we had moved in the true spirit of the juvenile court in, we would have decided that, hey, this is young man who never had an opportunity. Let's provide a good opportunity. The opportunity might be, yes, we're going to send him to the juvenile department of Corrections, but I  that no department of Corrections, they are services, schools, councils, the ratio between students and teachers. And try to help this individual upon his release at the age of 21, 19 years of age, provide that individual with an opportunity to make something up. To reintroduce. to decide to understand that he is a chap. And that's all he works. He's a chap. You may say that he performed in a billet act, but when you're a child speaking, act as a chap. Darren Baudy. How do you do this? This next song is from Johnny Cash's album. Put it at post office. There's a lot of strange men in cell blocked him, and he's got this. ranges of him all was a friend of mine who's been his type. Staring at the wall. Staring at the wall. As he looked at the walls, the strong end told, you could hear him softly, curse. Nobody at all ever climbed that wall, but I'm going to be the first. Well, the warden walked by. that's some don't try. I'd hate to see you fall, but there is no doubt till carry you out. If you ever touch set warm, if you ever touch set warm, well a year when Baha doesn't think that's a truth. Well a year's gone, then mean Baha's reclaimed, but I can still recall for all of us I'm already tried on the way he died, but he never made that wall, never made that wall. Well, there's never been a man ever shipped this can, but I know a man who tried, and he used papers called at a jailbreak land, but I know it was suicide. I know it was suicide. Johnny Cash, your radio playhouse. Glenn Fitzgerald sees all this from another angle. By the way, if you are trying to think about doing those words, consider a way of being the show that is used for it one sentence, a very first radio contest here. Create one sentence, grammatical sentence, an interesting sentence. We hope using these words. The words are sick, got a pencil. Sick, traders, corrupt, bizarre, cheap, steel, devour, suck. serving and criminal rights and get the word damn credit. Okay, and if you didn't hear the beginning of the show, why not even gonna explain it? It's too... So Glenn Fitzgerald sees all this from the different questions of his missionary with youth for Christ, how to make sure he's the first. And he works with gang members. And for a lot of this job, from all of his job, actually he tries to bring gang members over to the world and spends a lot of time in prison. Jail's parents about time on the streets. But as part of his job, he goes out to suburban churches and does public speaking, partly to tell people about what the ministry is able to do in terms of turning boys. And partly to raise money, sometimes. And occasionally, he takes some boys with. But he says that when he goes out and talks to these suburbanists, he's mostly white suburbanist about what goes on in the city. And says the reaction is usually this. people being comfortable saying even in the church setting these kids really do need to be locked up with kids we need to throw away the key on this we need to something bad should happen should punish all this wrongdoer and yet they never feel that way about the kids that we bring to this now and I'm talking about guys who are really really not these are one of these are the real thing you know don't deal it you're gang violence between the two with with they would call missions. So those are the guys I bring into the meetings. And they will say to the kid, this is great what you're doing. The same people who five minutes ago were lining up in shoot them. I don't carry a lock them up for a way to key. The same people can instantaneously turn themselves around when they actually can see this kid. This is great. This we lie. Him, we lie, this is good. We can do this. But these other kids on the street, that's different. What what I was doing. saying now, get that with them, that goes back to what I was saying before about life, up, tuning in with it. I think we have to look at what's going on there. We have one consideration for these people who run the evening news and another one for the people who are in our lives and they intercircle our lives. For whatever reason is easy to take those people on the evening news and pronounce something ugly should happen to them, but that should never happen to these people. in her circle. Well, and I'm there to explain it. Wait a second, it's really the same thing. I think there's an unfortunate syndrome that many Christians fall prey to. And I'm speaking about my own buzz sisters. One way or another, I'm still on their side. I still love them. But I- I got to be honest about what I'm seeing out there. I think there's an unfortunate tendency to see our cells since we've been forgiven, in since we've made some improvements that we are there. We've been there for ascended to some lofty position from where we can look down on the rest of human society. But of all the people who shouldn't. be thinking, it's got to be us. What I'm saying is, Grace is the substance of my relationship with God. It's not a cute idea that's thrown in there, it's not just a really nice aspect. It's the stuff of which it's all about. Good big joke. committed to it with you for Christ. , a conservative would tell you if this guy did a crime, he's loud, he's an substitute, vanishing, and happened to him. A little would tell you, this person did a really bad thing because of their parents mistreating them and something really bad happened to their parents. , aren't eventually, don't you get tired of being mad. Inside the world of prison I bought him a fee, but I'm not as sad as I'm clear. Well, there's a great stone trapped. a house of worship in this dim of sin. When things that God had a place here at full sun, I say the soul of many lost men. Now this great stone chapel here at full sun. And the sun. One hundred years old made of granite rock and takes the ring of keys to move here at Paul's. But the door to the house of God is never lost. And side of the present my body may be but alone as it my soul free. There are men here that don't ever worship. There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray. But I've got down on my knees and that tree's foam, Shepple. And I think the Lord... For heaven me today, Others grace stone, Shappled here at Wilson. It has a touch of God's hand on every stone. This is the flower of light, in a field of darkness, And this given me the strength to burial. Inside and vast spares, My body may be the power as lit my soul free. When you're in your playhouse, I would  to do it. One side, not the best side, because how wide is that? You decide to let the cards in your chest use a punishment. When Coleman's house, General Colin Pau, dropped out of the presidential race. You decide to let the cards in your chest use a punishment. in that press conference, he was asked by a reporter, what would you have done if you had become president? And we're called, this is a candidate who even was criticized for having views that were so mainstream, so middle of the road that he landed no one. So let's listen to what he said. So leadership, the solidator, moving country forward toward, forward government, lesser government. Okay, so far we're in pretty standard territory to politicians in this country. Primetime means about the state of autonomous climate youth, drove this women political policies to spread their eagle وتches. It's a great formation of commerce, but nobody even can leave their communities to their team, to袁 Pink's passionate award. Anduter and Pot-form basis. Okay, so if I absolutely everything is just things you've heard before, very common things in our political culture. You've heard of inspired people, you've heard of the store, a sense of family, a source, a sense of shame in our society. That's the one that when I read in the paper, a source of sense of shame, clearly this is at a point where now everyone, , this is why it's written up that you just said it in an off-hand way and you didn't even have to explain it or bother, here's what you said next. I'll bring more civility into our society. That's it. Wait. At this point in our program, in the interest of equal time, we thought that we would have a story of people. We do not have much of a situation in this society. And in fact, we are not looking at this. And in fact, I do not believe that we do a privilege, pretty much everybody who we heard of and heard from so far in the show. We're talking about centers, basically, we've had the good people, I'm going to have this part. We have part of the show, the interest of equal time. We're talking. here about. And , one of the things about sin, besides the fact that many sinners are not secreted. One of the things that is often underestimated is that sin is not, no sin is not us, all fun things. And this next little story from Cheryl Trech is pretty much a vivid illustration of what that means when thou seek it. Sally Colton says, Pat, has just come home with a big bag of POT and that maybe I should come over for dinner. Yes, I say. Maybe I should. What a friendly gesture I think to myself as I dash across the park on my way over. I just met Sally and Pat two nights before at an amiable little tavern up the street on Damon. What a night that was. Laughing and joking. Crazy photo booth sessions, 50 cent shots of Yager Misedur and a very generous barkeep. Sally seemed to know rather well. I don't recall much of any conversation that took place that night just that, well, Sally kept ticking off her top and that everyone was having lots of fun. I crossed Damon and turned up Evergreen where a group of boys wearing Laker Jackets man the corner. One of them spits and calls me a yuppie. I'm serious. It means this as a joke so I take no offense. Oh no, I'm quite flattered. He thinks I have insurance and credit cards and that I make more than $4,000 a year. Still I wonder if we don't attach different meanings to the word, Yuppie. Clearly, he means one thing I need another. The way bitch to some does not mean nasty slut, but rather, hello woman. I'd  to illustrate to the young man that he's made a mistake that I'm not what he thinks I am and as a matter of fact I'm on my way to get high and quite possibly we share something of a bond. I turned to him and say, all buds are not cockroaches. of ease my quick wit shows itself I continue walking and in the background behind me here someone hooking a lugee. Sally is glad to see me. Very glad. For dinner she's made her favorite noodles with pepper and garlic, lots of pepper, lots of garlic. Pad is glad to see me also but it's much less physical about it. No juicy lip kisses from pat. Just a bear chest to self piercing. The new couple rings a shaved head and a downward glance it says, hello, woman. Sally sets the dinner table while Pat puts on some music. A deep trans techno asset house hot mix of apocalyptic wonder with 185 beats per minute. Perfect with dinner. Pat seems  he's glad to see me, but I wonder if his selection music isn't a thinly veiled attack. Manifesting as resentment might coming over to smoke is dope. Still. He's not myself, he's the perfect guest. I say at the dinner, this is a stunning tune. Who is this? Oh, do you  it? He says and turns it up. Is this it could go any louder? It's idiot bliss. Idiot bliss. Oh, Didn't you want to? No, Pat says. Oh, well, I've got to stop living with my head. No, hold on. I'm not. Sally eats her dinner  a little cat rabbit, nibbling and lick. I watch her lick her fingers. She licks her knife and after that she licks the serving spoon. I watch her eat and talk at the same time. I got a letter in the mail today for my friend, now and Seattle she says she drinks her wine with little laps of the tongue. And how is Meow I ask? Not Meow, Pat says Meow,  meow, meow! I beg your pardon, From the looks of the apartment, I wouldn't have guessed Pat with such a stickler for detail. Sally says, Miao says that if a spaceship comes down for us, we should get on it because it will be God come to save us. She says everyone in Seattle is talking about it. Pat's face will not let up that I have offended a sense of aesthetic, the sticking meow for meow. How could I have been so careless? I use the notion of God told these stations to lure Pat back into the con. of difference in civility. PAD, I say, really you get on God's Holy spaceship when it comes. Get on it, you says, no. I might get in it, but I'm not writing on top. Sally asks, if I will get on God's Holy spaceship, I tell her it depends on who else is getting on. What do you mean, she asks? Well, I'm not going to board really nearly, I say. Would if my upstairs neighbor. gets on. That man raises pitfalls. I'm not getting on with that. I tell her if that I'd say Oprah Winfrey getting on. I might have a change of heart. That says he would rather get on the super highway and meet God there on his own rather than get on the spaceship which  the best will only be a breeding ground for TV. He says the spaceship will be for people who don't have computers and that he will have his bodyguard cars. He says definitely he will not get on God's holy spaceship. if a brush limba is on. On the spaceship or on TV I asked, Pat looks at me as though there are horrible smell coming from my direction. Sally says she will not get on God totally spaceship if there is anything on TV because that would mean that someone would still be left on earth and that she, Sally, would want to be the very last last person to board God totally spaceship. She asks, what if I can't see that Oprah already has your seat? This is a game of... What if it's starting to depress me and I announce to the table that I will not be boarding God's Holy Spaceship at all? Pat passes from behind me on his way into the kitchen detectively mutters as if anyone cares. What do you mean you won't be getting on God's spaceship, Sally asks? There's an element of fear and her concern for my salvation. I tell her I mean that if wicker park gets on God's Holy Spaceship, I won't be. But nobody else would be here, Sally reduces. You'd have to get high all by yourself. Yes. But if nobody were left in Wiccupark, you'd have to go all the way to humble park to get your dough. I tell her if there were no in Wiccupark, then I'd be high on life when I wouldn't need a bag of dough. Sally's offended by this somehow, and I spent after dinner time in the kitchen helping with dishes of the gesture of goodwill and gratitude for the future bullet boots we will share in the living room. After I have persuaded Patty, change the... music. I ask Sally, probing questions about her childhood and family. I think interest in her fears, her many, many affairs. One right after another, and then the stream of half-night romances with this bartender, that bartender, this cap driver, that cap driver, this paramedic, that paramedic. I imagine Sally's service is readily available to any adventurous commuter on God's Holy spaceship who it all. her a smile. Your crazy about God's spaceship, Cheryl, she says, you better get on with God. I imagine Sally getting on with God. I follow her into the living room where Pat hangs  a bat from a bar on the rack off the ceiling. I wonder why he's doing this just after eating. Sally and I sit on the couch. She picks up the classified section of the reader and scan the book. personal, it's usually but with intent. I wonder why she's invited me over. Where was this alleged bag of POT? I  cigarettes to drop the hint that something needed to get burning. I dropped the hint that I have very bad, bad cramps. Sally asked Pat to get me some adville from the bathroom. You get it, he says, I'm hanging! You get it, Pat. Sally says, Hi reading! Pat crunches himself up quickly 50 times before disengaging himself in the rat. He executes a mid-air flip to get down and tells me I wouldn't have such bad cramps if I got more exercise. I follow him to the bathroom, which has no door on it. A beach towel drapes the entrance. He pops the top off the eye, the volcano in our ass, how many, one or two. Twent. In the living room, Pat changes the music to something a little more subtle. And the end. industry noise. Cheryl darling, you get me Pat's jacket in the coach in the hall. Yes, Pat, of course. A shift is taking place. We are rounding the band. I pretend I don't know where care that Sally must be sending me to retrieve something very special from Pat's jacket. I pretend it's the farthest thing for my mind that I am about to get very, very high. Pat's jacket in the hall? I don't know. and see, hey? Oh, this jacket? Sally takes the jacket, pulls out what I have been waiting for. , yes. She tells me it's hydroponic and that'll little goes a long way. I understood. She pinches off a bit of it for the bond. A forfeit water pipe, the landlord. Sally tells me leftover during one of his last project days a month ago. Cheryl Darling, she says again, it's up to you. of darling could make any more attractive what she was about to offer me. Yes, pet. Did  a dog will live for hours anything spread with peanut butter? A pretty little pixie-faced nuns me. Really? Peanut butter. Thousands. Oh yes, she says, Fundy, she calls and from the other room, jogs in a black dog, the mix of dobermen and rotweiler. I watch Sally lighten, suck up the bomb. She holds it in and blows. out all of her fundy space. Hello, boy. She says, and that's a moisture-faced dog kisses. Cheryl Darling, she says again. Yes. Pat. I'm not going to get you high and tell you a poem that's going with me and God in the spaceship. I should have seen it coming. Oh, Pat. Are we still on that tired routine? Pat sits in an armchair, reading with focus and bigger the pages of an interview magazine with his fixed gay. Strikes and uncountry resemblance to Captain Picard deep in thought. I try not to look at them. Or the beautiful bed Sally has placed in a recola tin on the coffee table. I try not to think of myself on God's holy spaceship with Sally as my bunkmate. The endless night's at, talking, giggling, salary counting the minis stewards she had screwed that day. How could it get any worse? I wonder, sometimes I am too much of a snob. Why wouldn't Sally make a wonderful... Bunkmate. All bugs are not cockroaches. All bugs are not cockroaches. I think to myself, oh Pat, really well. If it'll make you happy, good Sally says. Pat, we're even in the jar of skipping from the kitchen. I'm going to show Cheryl something. Cheryl Trick, coming at the hot-out, back in the day. My baby's gone on a trip to the moon And she won't be back to soon She doesn't write me in, I can't sleep all I hear from her My baby's open a rock at machine Since she left she didn't see She doesn't call me, I can't sleep all I hear from her My baby's open a rock at machine My baby's open a rock at machine My baby's open a rock at machine I miss you, baby.
