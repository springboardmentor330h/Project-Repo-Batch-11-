  "text": "Consider please this what has scandal in the year 1881. No treason, bribery, or other high crimes in this immune-rescance to the state. President still did not survive an off-sum full year. Of course, he had a much bigger problem than any days by our current president, specifically but what happened to him? President changed a garb bill, which shot by an assassin in July of 1881. But it was a strange thing, here's what the scandal begins. See Linder, sick in bed, from his infected wound, rumors began. Hospital, please. from within White House. So it's fairly clear from a modern perspective that the end of suffering from infection from wound. Nancy Thompson is an Australian at the State University of New York, the Stony Brook. What's fascinating is that the wound itself was not sufficient to explain what was wrong with him. There was such a long history of popular belief that in White House was weary unhelpful thanks to Custard's dad's mum. The rumor began to circulate that what really was wrong would go to West the state of the White House toilets that they weren't properly hooked up to the sewer system and that he was being poisoned by sewer tests. The sewer gas. In the 19th century, as indoor plumbing was between the more and more widespread, it just sort of breaked people out that there was something inside their own houses is pipe that he did. into a huge public sewer. They just seemed filthy. And they believe that gases rose in the decaying matter in the sewers came back up the pipes and they just said. And because our nation is of course crazy when it comes to the presence. Because the white ones, as among other things, the national movie screen, onto which we project a whole array of fears and misplaced idealism, we projected our national fear of sewer gas on to the presence. If you're with so-called in June of 1882, the Senate Act. actually voted $300,000 to build a second White House. A second one, a sanitary one, free of bill right next door to the original White House. And the idea was, first time I'm just moved right in there. A lot of this was the work of Chester Arthur who succeeded, got you. And who wouldn't live in the White House. He was so convinced that it was unhealthy, that he lived in a soldier's home to avoid exposing something. one of the things that's really amazing reading about this is the way that you write about the press coverage. They equivalent to current tabwatch. They become a new year of a pair of one point they interviewed what they call a well-known comber and you just think a well-known comber. He's an unnamed source who asserts that Garfield for the real trouble Dakle certainly now continues with stockage and community. and seen unnamed source claims there is not a perfect working sewer trap in the executive dimension. Indeed, in the whole concept of sewer trap, that was to prevent that sewer air from backing up into the home. So, an untrapped toilet was the portal of death. Naturally, this being the United States government, independent investigator had to be brought in. In this case, a sanitary engineer. The image of the judge wearing, the patient from South Florida's expert in the sort of plumbing issues, trusted the issue of non-partisan objective report, and while the word problems in the White House plumbing system, they were nowhere near as bad as popular rumor had. He could put a depressive graph of probably did not die of the work in us. Probably the bullet wasn't up. The issue was of sufficient public importance that when his final report was issued long exert for published verbatim, even in New York Times, and one. which is in front of the others, one of the changes that were recommended at the White House in the report is that they installed these new kinds of toilets, toilets of zone design, and this sound is still very new, name, they were white, animated porcelain. And after this, toilets  this became a huge fat, mentally replacing, wooden and metal toilets, nearly everywhere in this country. Somehow this association between white and personal, it was sold by plumbing contractors people  wearing new, devised these kinds. of toilets as safer because the porcelain would be impervious. I think I could get in there and bestow. And also you could see that it was clean. Now I bring all this up today not stuck by the nature of the presence, but stuck by the stone and germs. All of this, everything in this story occurred before the germ theory of disease has been proven. People did not know that germs were the way that diseases spread. That's why they were scared. things  sewer gas. And it would be nice to think that with more information, packed short information, had that how disease actually spreads, would all become more rational, irrational precautions for taking steps. But the fact is, that is simple not on. At this room, we are experiencing a boom, an antibacterial soap since skin products, antibacterial children's toys and kitchen and bones, pizza, colors, and underwear, and eggs . to healthy middle-class people who, if they use the products as intended, will be no healthier as a result of using the products. We want to be rational creatures, but we are flawed. We are not rational. One area we see at all the time is when it comes to germs. The VBEZ Chicago and public radio and internationalist American life are my requests. Today on our program, germs and our struggle to stay calm in the universe. filled with microscopic creatures that killed us or make us sick. And one of our programs today, Debuk will thank him in the digital world, Porter Hannah Rosen did an investigation of new antibacterial products, new investigation in her report. She marked them as an effective. She marked people who used them until one day. She went through her own transformation from rationality to irrationality. And two, 20th century, Jerome, terms of first understood the turn of this century and it turns out that the aesthetics of everyday life in this century, the way that we dress, the way we groom ourselves, the way that we make our homes, for all the way they are partly in response to this newfangled idea of germs. Let me explain how. Actory. Ladies and germs. We bring you one woman's story. Act 4. You're going to eat that quarter of your farmer prank grounding on how irrational fear means that you probably are not going to see decent apple cider and your local grocery store into this car. All, at five, conqueror of germ, shone columns and germs within us, germ freaking kill us, and the germs that do kill us. Let's stay right here. Act 1. Biblical thinking. Well, our nation goes through waves of germ consciousness. Social reformers have been turned to the century, tried to clean up the city's slums, prevent this spread of the proclosies and other diseases. Let him to wash and put him. among former slaves about middle-class, clunginess and gospel of the toothbrush. When we put our Hannah Rose in notice the latest wave of American-Jerm consciousness kick-in, she wrote about it for a couple times. I was either in a store buying a melt-aid with some of my friends or having kids, or about to have kids and I, and I was in a toy store and I was trying to buy something from some of my, I just noticed that everything was antibacterial and I thought, hmm, that sounds strange because , kids eat dirt. So what would, would get where a dude had sort of? little antibacterial chair, but there it was, I mean, the fire trucks and the things that kids chew on and play pens and everything was suddenly antibacterial and I just sort of looked into it and realized there was just an entire universe of booming universe of antibacterial products which is used by any antibacterial television. In fact, I heard in a friend of mine in England had told me that there was an entire antibacterial super I just started to ask people and then I realized it was everywhere. I'm going to make you ask me to read a visual section in the article where you're explaining the extent to this and displaying that now antibacterial sobs are 50% of the 2.1 billion dollar sop market. Then  this little passage we try to convey how far this is gone. Sure. It is already possible to spend most of your day in germ free comfort. You can get a good night's sleep on an antibacterial pillow. Snuggled under an antibacterial blanket. Brush your teeth with antibacterial toothpaste. Take a shower with antibacterial soap. Dry off with an antibacterial. towel. Pull on your antibacterial socks and underwear. Eat breakfast on your antibacterial tray. Say goodbye to Spawn in his antibacterial dog bed. Eat a little suzzy her antibacterial toy. Grab a cookie from the antibacterial jar. Spray the bust seat and your office home with antibacterial clear. Then come home and chop up some salad with your antibacterial mind. And in the substance of your alcohol, you spend a lot of time in your alcohol. I mean mocking is products and the people who use them and you argue essentially that for most adults these things really do nothing Yeah, it's partly that they just oversell themselves. I mean I imagine they they don't have zero use but but most scientists say that the major disease risks from ordinary contact with ordinary everyday services and Substances   a table or or a scissor or the kinds of things these things are used are basically zero if you're a health the adult, you don't have much risk for just touching things on your desk. So these products don't do that much good. And the thing you put in your article is that when we get cold or flu, what we're getting is virus. Right. It's very different from bacteria, which is what these things are actually targeted in that. Right. That's the set. And that's point two is that in general, a lot of these things. A lot of diseases are caused by viruses, not germs. So these don't help against virus and all. Well, it would be a problem. people with kids is there is there is someone jitterman use for some list of I suppose I mean but I think even in most cases what will happen is the kid will get upset and kids get upset I don't have to find friends with kids because constantly getting sick  I said kids eat dirt they chew on each other you know there's only so much to do you could be a bit of a curall I mean see they talk about curall and explain this product is saying I wouldn't say Patur Arsenal got scared popular these days I now see Pirell everywhere it's an airport it's just everywhere it's basically it's an anti-bacterial hand soap which is sort of a combination of the alcohol they use in the hospital plus some sort of aloe vera lotion so it feels good  in the guy who the the the company that started it was a company that that actually made hospital products and they suddenly realized that there was sort of a domestic use for this stuff and it it comes in a pump bottle and you should pump it on your hands and rub it on it feels  lotion but it's actually meant to kill the back tube on your hands so , I'm so dead bacteria. It's not so preventative. You touch something and it's later you'll just get that thing again. But my problem with Purell is that they they're, , they describe the product. They describe it as the sort of sunny healthy thing. , they have, when you talk to the company, they'll talk to you about, , how good family living and , take your kids on a camping trip or a mother with her diapers and they 'll just describe it as sort of just another part of us. Norman Rockwell and American Life, but then if you look at the actual ads they're run, they're clearly meant to appeal to the hassle of the upbeat and all of us. I mean, they show the sort of Petri dish with these office products and some disgusting looking germs all over your phone and everything. So they're actually meant for people who don't even have time to wash their hands after they go to the bathroom or just have four seconds to eat, they're lunch at their desk and so they have to use pure outfits and take too much time to go to the sink and wash your hands. It's just sort of ... the way that their idea that they're not marking to fear just in a true you look at their ads and they're just terrifying here nobody wants to know that there's this gross stuff on their phone if there is it doesn't do you any good to know that and in my dad actually even harm him it's gonna prove that it does seem to harm him right that's my other thing I mean all these sort of subway pole ads I mean it's once  that these germs are on your phone or on your desk are you'll never forget that every time you look at a subway pole you'll just imagine it sort of alive and pronged with maggots and worms and you'll just have a hard time pitching it so that's why I wish I had never known about this stuff because now I've, , now it's just sort of there in my head but there's no reason why you ever have to know that you're staple on your desk might have germs on it just sort of sounds yucky no it's meagreth and they asked you to describe what happened after your article was published you found that you yourself went through a change yeah yeah that was really terrible I mean I suddenly after I spend  a month or a month or a month was just talking to people various companies who did research about this and suddenly I suddenly sort of went home and started to worry about what I was using on my cutting board and should I, , should I disinfect my cutting boards and how or should I, , should I, , I should we not have rare meat when I was at a restaurant just because I knew about the stuff is just the images so gross if you feel  you have some knowledge into an underworld that you just can't somehow banish from your head. And I think I'm not the only one that's happened to I mean. And the germs got in a lot of popularity recently. And there's been, there was a front page story in the New York Times magazine. There was a front page time magazine story. It seems to go in waves where everyone's in a while, everyone's in a while, there's a germ phobic panic. One of the things that you write about in these articles is that these paradoxes that society gets cleaner and searches for germs even more remote places. Yeah. That was very interesting. And that seems to be a sort of theme of American history that sort of gets its moments or more possible . person who was thinking about home life, domesticity. So we start to turn to home, and it's a blend-lead. We start to worry a lot about the blend-lead. I mean, you'd have these 1950s, , lots of home ads. You can have some sparkly, new, new products and home. But , one thing I pointed out is that even in that, there's just sanctions because the 50s ads that they would be, they would be infused with this kind of sense of American progress. , here we are moving forward. Lendor will save you, X amount of time. Now this floor cleaner, well boy, you don't have to bend down anymore. , this is the new America. But now with the suit, new household microbiology, it seems to have the exact opposite kind of rim tone to it. , we thought we cleaned everything. We'll know we're going backwards now. , all these things you thought we cleaned, we're dirty. I think it's almost what happens to police officers right now. Start to think that there's danger everywhere because they spend a lot of time around danger. So they think that world is world. So if you spent a fair amount of time in science, you're saying germs are everyone pulling them up. When you go around, you would literally see and imagine germs everywhere in your environment. Yeah,  I would go to the gym in the morning and I saw something thought, huh, should I sit on this bench? what, what's going to happen? Is it going to be bacteria growing through my toes if I could shower and gym? And , it's just everywhere. I would be sitting and eating on my couch at home and just  wash for dust balls and drinking to dust balls. I would cook dinner. It's  everything nice to get. activity was to suddenly ruin, , it was just kind of infiltrated by the horrible underworld. So we kind of crawling up before it. Yeah. You wrote it in a second article published after the first one wrote that in terms of a cease-fire kind of dementia. And you wrote that an hour doesn't divide when your hand doesn't stray over the bottle to squirre up your perfectly clean hands. And I hate that. I mean, what this ultimate revenge for Purell eventually happened to me and they'd send me all the products, which I mean, there's plenty of German perfect. my office at the time. So I gave most of my waves. Then I couldn't give all of my waves. So I just had this little bottle of purelciting on my desk and I would notice that, , for a hand-stuffs or a tiny bit clamor, I was , picking up some loose people in that day. I was just suddenly go over this shirt and start sneezing at , and thought, oh, did I have enough? But, , then knowing that if you don't actually invent anything, maybe I should do it again, because maybe you were , , three minutes and slightly the last time, , then you're going to head started to show up, and I'm thinking, is that right? I was , it's calling from across the bush. I'm to the... They should maybe that's a good idea. They should have been talking to you. I'm sorry. Maybe it would be too powerful. No one would be able to resist. Exactly. , it's so disturbing that I was going to talk about, , the way the information works. kind of situation comes to germs that is from the cure about the germs, , then you come over where you're from, you have to be rational and... It's almost  a pre-enlightment view of what information does to a person. That is that it won't be to rational things. You want to spell fear and paranoia, but in fact, will we to get here, ? In a certain way, it's very difficult. I mean, it's very garden-eating. that, that you will get this information. You eat in the tree of knowledge, and then you will be expelled. of calm paradise. Right. No, it's true. It's completely, I mean, one thing we've writing this is done is transform my understanding information. I mean, I'm a journalist, so I love, , the more inspiration the better. I'm not worried about the information, but then reading this is made me sort of see information in another way. So how's the battle for rational people going in real life? You just keep thinking up. I think I, it's just sort of fading. I think I've lost my, I've lost a little bit, although not all of my dear parents. I don't, , now I think laziness has prior parents. Now the battles still happen, but I'm just too lazy to actually disinfect my cutting board. what? I think God correct me. The only thing more powerful than fear. And the reason is now reported for the Washington Post. If the joy and eletron finally explain the life that you've had game title from 트�;; It's not a success..... Come on, racism in the North Pole of China And put your vote on just 25 to2017. Actu 20th century germ's. People understood about gyrims, they knew somethings but how does he spread? Get a open contact with a very sick person. in the back of the human ways. But people are not exactly sure how you got no. You thought that some diseases might just travel through the air, but that other diseases might be inherited. There's a whole sewer gas thing. Then, in the germ theory, the notion that there are these tiny living microorys and organisms that can get on your hands or your clothes and then you can transmit this tiny little living features to somebody else by teaching them, teaching them food, by sneeze or by coughing. All of this is only discovered just before the turn of 20th century. The Australian anti-poms is written a book called DASPAL OF JERMS. of how the germ theory spread in America, in class America. It turns out that one of the characteristics of the 20th century is that it's the first time in human history that people understood how diseases transmitted and an entire aesthetics emerges an entire way of living based on the fact that people now want to avoid spreading germ structure. Yes, you can see dramatic changes in interior decoration, in calm design, and the revolve against a victory. the static, the plush, the morning, the dust catching. Because dust was one of the vehicles that the new bacteria is pointed to for germs. So what is the aesthetic? What is the image you use to edit? It's stripped down. It's a preference for less rather than more. It's the use of hard surfaces, light colored surfaces, paint as opposed to wallpaper. paper was thought to hold germs into green germs. And in the bathroom itself, you just read how it sounds and comes in the last century. The bathroom basically looks  any of them, the bugs, the grapes, wood, everything. The bathroom looks  a little car alert. And then we help our farmers get a call from that and we see all those bugs and traps. Dangerous use bugs. там traps and your laws. Top particles get na- and then you end up with a bathroom that looks much more  our modern conception and we'll have a portion on the floor, a portion on the sink, a portion of toilet pictures, something that can easily clean strong. So, I mean essentially you arrive in the bathroom which is  operating in the hospital. I mean I remember the first time I ever saw an operating room that thought you had what's exactly  a bathroom you said there's a little. Yes, and , this stripping down didn't apply just in the home, but also applying to the body and to the clothing. So with women, one of the James things, the shortening of skirts, because long skirts swept along the street, picked up dust, dirt, the curing of germs. There's a big push, starting late in the century to get and shape. , the idea of male authority, right? some troops along the east and from my chops. You can have to take a look at those two forms. Say to American men, if you love your wife, you love your child. Save that beard off. Don't keep them germ, lay pieces. And of course, Gillette jumps on this because they've been raped on this. Guys, because none of these ambitions ever happened about some sort of product on this. Exactly. Other invasions from the beginning of the age of germs, clean eggs and cellophane, glycerine, named after surgeon Joseph Lister, also because antichibertuosus activists get your own fresh bar of soap and a hotel room and get clean sheets and they fold the sheet back over the blanket so you don't touch the germs on the blanket. And it's time's history of all this is called Gospel of Germs. That's great. Ladies and gums. Didn't take long after the existence. and characteristics of terms of improvement for public health educators began to talk about the man problem. Men were not being vigilant, not venting the spreading of germs. Study in the 1920s and months in the anime noted that men still refuse to stop sitting, despite widespread particular research and patient campaigns to hold them not to step. The most of the responsibility for preventing the spread of terms felt on women. Home, their food, it is no surprise that the psychological studies today indicate that women are more vitamin-known that have sessions with teen age symptoms. terms and it can go pretty far. Emily Colis is the author of this amazing and funny and disturbing honest kind of prone session called just checking the answer to your speech. The TV was on and it wasn't paying attention and as I went to turn up the sound so I was shocked to notice what was on the screen when my hand was stolen, volume button. The guy who'd obviously been in a fight was kneeling down spinning blood into the snow. I frozen fear for a second and then became a tip. I was obsessed with the idea that I somehow contracted a disease from this television encounter. So much so that I was unable to keep it to myself. My husband always been able to rationalize my fears as either an unusual personality curve, or some hormonal pregnancy problem. But at this moment, who is no longer able to differentiate me from any other crazy person? That 90-pays-drawn has some disbelief, finding his nails and changing his head from side to side same. You don't really believe back to you. The show is key. months ago. There's no way in the disease could live that long near. Besides, there's a screen between you and the blood. My husband and I generally kept a pile of about 20 garbage bags in one corner of our apartment, which made him out of character. We needed to let them stay. But it was our trash, and I knew nothing bad was in there. It was the communal trash that made me shake. So when it was time to take bags out to the... the dumpster. My husband had to follow a whole hygienic procedure. To keep the neighbors terms on barclinks. First the water had to be turned on and left that way because if you touch the garbage and then this spigot, the spigot would get contaminated. Next you take one bag in his right hand and open the door with his left. Then you shut the door behind him and lock so that no one could get into the house. I guess I could have monitored, but he wanted me at stairs so I couldn't critique him. He took the bag down, stand a few feet from the dumpster. to be sure not to touch it and throw the bag in. Then you'd unlock the door, opening, slip the shoes off, come inside and wash his hands. He used a pump soap so that he could use his clean rest to pump some in the palm of his hand and not contaminate the distance. The water would stay on and he'd move on to the next pack. He went through this procedure 20 times, once reached bad until they were gone. If contamination occurred at any point during the process, so how  keep your car wet! brown  I was on the outside one in the bag and I got on a shirt and I saw it. I would not be happy. I had to go over to see me again and again my head and to find the way to convince myself and I wasn't really in danger of getting me to see me. I didn't expect myself for cuts at the brown  I'd mind if gone into. Go over the list of things we'd run out in the past weeks that could have been brown or try to remember if anyone had come into our house who might have thrown something away  a bloody tissue. The could have gone on me. If I couldn't check. here, Edass my husband to get through the discarded trash to find the contaminated back and try to identify the liquid. He was usually pretty against this, so I had to bang. It was all I'd talk about for hours, and I guess in an effort to just shut me out, be relent. Of course, this trip was considered highly unsanitary and called for special protective measures. He had to put on clothes that he'd be willing to get rid of and carry paper towels, so his hands wouldn't touch the bag directly. When he was finished with his inspection, he had to take off his clothes. outside our front door. Leave them to be thrown away, come in and do a double hand wash. Then I turned the shower on and finished cleaning up. I'd sit on the edge of the batting weight frame to finish so I could deliver his report. On this day here identified the liquid as hamburger juice, particularly in cities  what that is close to the coloring texture of human blood. My husband said that he smelled it and tasted it, and was sure that it was indeed from the cat. Looking back, I'm a little surprised that it was four more years before we separate. And we call this, we'll just call it Jess checkin' Coming up, the germ does kill you. What does the germ get out of it? Also, you can go food, impure pots, it's a mini Publicating international, win hard programs To American life, my request, welcome all ladies and germs. Since everything happened today, Steve is again to say ladies and germs as many times as I want to privilege, , you don't get very often in public radio. Each within a program of course, we choose theme ladies and germs. Bring your variety of different kinds of stories on that theme today's program. Germs and why they make us lead the world of rationality for irrationality. We've elected a four of our program for gun-eat app. One of the places that we fear germ contaminations. course in our food, but I'm sure it's not always justified. For example, this file, this very file, changes our you will not be able to find fresh apple cider and local groceries. Don't talk about the stuff that comes to straightened farm, and pasteurized the brown usually it's a very terrible blend of four five in kinds of apples based on some farm families on recipe. Unpasteurized cider  this only makes up three to five percent in the nation's cider, but this is becoming harder and harder to find. In reason? Thanks planning is a record of coffee, covers, public. stories and this is a question. First, who? I'm not just an object in here, most I have a farmer's bias. My brother and I go apples. I heal top of the stream and talk. I'm going to read the site. This year, as last year, then the year before that we've been hauling our cider down to the Kentucky State Fairytale. Well, do you hear I am? The egg, produce to stalking the cider or slushies? Half of cider, slushies. Come get a free take. Can't go wrong with free. Slurving with. Here Apple juice. Hey, call up once they take. When you drink one of those slashes, that matter, we draw a plane cup fresh side. We want to steal away all these balls. That's it. That's it.

Rescue. E Colone. Road 1 5 7 He read about him. And he was heard about him in the 1980s. these aridus, great cider contamination scares. But most of course, we saw the same story when we wondered, has cider fallen victim to that front line of bacterial arm again, threatened's all our collective fate? So I called up Joel O'Leary, the food safety scientists that are state farming extension service university, Tucky, told him we were and used by the site's health risks. Well, that you went a lot of other people. But the number of it has really been seen. , when you look at this one, I'll be number of, and it's only about three of those. But it can be a risk of it in the same size. But again, I've got a thing of two. The problem is, OW. That is pretty. Liquid, organic, yuppance spectrum. All natural, all organic systems.

Here's how far it is gone. Well, how I've worked with soundly of some brown cool scale cytopan and bass. Very nice vibe. A technical performance. My favorite, Mitchie, from Ohio's Biggsman, or at Oklahoma's Sport. Well, the dog got, as a result of this, this E-co-white thing out of Colorado, is one incident. Why did it? This is maybe the other pose, pasteurization, all these fire makers. Next thing we do, we're called into this meeting. In effect, we were told now, because don't have to pass, but we're gonna advise the schools saying now, don't let your children run right excited for many of these the problems or orchards if it has been passed. Oh, I don't think that's needed. Let's head there. going to go ice. I think there are attitude in the day. What does it say? If there are going to be wrong, they want to err on the side of safety. Well, it's  saying, which is more safe. Drink, drop the beer before you drive down the road or one drop of beer before you drive down the road. One place is safe is the other, but you don't want to break hazard. It's time to call that stage. Do you want to grab the right act of all girls? That would be samples. Do you have the perfect... I'm very nice man. It's a firm. Yes. There's never been in case two points of silence. Yes. We've never had the world where all the AKs of food poisoning from any bacteria that was Foundary international hydrogen advisor. And we had a situation where Columbus was a part of unique, there was about 10 cases of human, goli01-57, each 72-pointly reported, Columbus. And what kind of food products do you use? Well, early on, one of the common foods that many of the tenors, so in fact people had been supposed to recite it. And there was a leak to the press that don't really work in from that was covering this се heavily at the time, a leaked of local press saying that cider was suspected. Of course, the investigation was not complete and later on it was shown that cider was not the likely culprit that the likely was the sweaters. But the fact that it leaked into the press, the cider was suspect food. Press Citer sales. The city of Columbus was also a large marketer state dropped by about two thirds overnight. And just did it. cover for the press. And contact media or stand to press the session. Yes. It really went well. And the media was good to pick up on. And showed up a lot of news, friend. And he wasn't a fan. Basically positive that he could probably maybe have or did a fighter or a player, but that the fighter industry here know. I owe is being proactive to do whatever they can to learn toy techniques, do safe cycle. But that includes pretty much every people, not very compassionate and safe. Yes, and well, we took the position that if it's produced properly with proper sanitation that unpassed by cider is not the problem. Hear crib. Out of the problem. But takes up a point for instance and charges under the airplane. Served on passenger ice开. Wilt it since now in this sense. So now remember something else Joe here, poop science, released. They think of it they think of it Far side or Operation And now it's taster, let's rest! So that's one of the reasons why they're being made from the James Bond.

We're going to use the process of using the response of the group. We're going to use the response of the group. Tom Willard, the response of the response of the partners from that. The only one is the response to the say, well, who takes you really effectively every if a super word to state ill by a particular product, they could lose track of the fact whether it was pasteurized, not that will take you to damage the reputation of false means going that factor. It's why we feel it's important that all just past your own.

More often than not, we use the language of war when we talk about disease. Someone said to battle the answer on a fight in the searching. The truth is, the metaphors in the afternoon. In case of my friend Christopher, the journey in the morning, it took some 15 years to happen, but it won. It didn't really reach battle, but it won. Now this story of the germs within us, and what we've heard about them, namely, let's kill us. Someone else tell me. It's a count of battle that is friend, it's for Rose, I'm thrilled about. Christopher Greb and a tiny climate community in Central Illinois, but had more of a milk power in the Islamic, a professional musician to turn to the worst in years. There is a fact of medicine late in the 20th century that seems absolutely absurd on its face, and it's this. Just about the worst place you can be in really sick is in the hospital. 5-10% of all patients admitted to American hospital. The quiet infection while they're there. The rate of these sub-phobomusic homo and hospital-acquired infections is much higher in patients admitted to intensive care units. In fact, a measurable percentage of patients on ICU is died, not at the conditions of land of them in intensive care units, but from one of these bugs they picked up while they are in hospital. These germs were often the notestrain of staff or notest areas, are resistant to most in- tracker or in-by-art. Music and they live there in the hospital. And they got Christian. If you lie in one position long enough, perhaps in this few as a few days, you're at risk for developing work called pressure systems, which happen because you're weight rests and just to keep parts of your body. Your butt, your tailbone, the backs of your elbows. What happens is the weight of your body and blood out of the cap and ears. skin in these places. This happens especially for blood pressure in some of them, which means the circular towards system doesn't bring as much oxygen to tissue, and begins to die. The skin literally breaks down, bugs that live in the hospital in love for us. These pressure zones are huge gateways to the certain times system. You might as well put up signs this way in, this way to the rest of the body. Germs allowed direct access to the blood and kind of go wild eventually. growing on things  cartons and eating land. They can cause death litter when the matter of ours. So for patients and ICU is especially immobile ones. Skin care is really important. Of course, skin care was always important, crystal. Ecology, when he didn't have rent, he had a supply for meat products. And now the doctors really didn't want him to lose the defense he's skin to provide. In the end, in on his own, Christopher did develop an nasty bed soon. A sample got sent to the lab to the culture, and he came back positive for an antibiotic resistant bacteria, a strange staff. As soon as that happens signs, one of them is one of the big letters, contact propulsion. He told us to wash her hands on entering my living. It'd be good luck again. and the pain and direct contact with the patient. This was to keep the body in the room and to keep it from making for rays of other rooms on the moon. And they would routinely draw his blood to see if it may have passed his skin, past that last, past his nose, and into his bloodstream. Suddenly, all you can think about is every possible shirt and verticein on some of your skin. Just how are you supposed to wash your hands in such a motion? I thought myself wondering, Peshit turned the water. off with my elbows, or at least use the paper towel and touching the possum. In the end you take your cube from the nurses and you see that soap and water seem to do the trick to the loop friction under running water. Nothing to elaborate, really quite quick, but it's amazing how important that one act is in controlling hospital and acquiring infections. International society even purchased diseases in output the book vision and we've xi seeds in absorbing infectious in my work or my phone, which chronicles ways to control infection and operating moves in ICWase and what basically everywhere in the hospital. We friends said that during this production working title for the work was Washer Hewns statement. That was rejected in the fading and more sober, and but in infection control in the hospital. Christopher had made it clear to be one who created a grasshopper, as long as there was sister to be impossible, that treatment would lead someone. He's worked. So he was a grasshopper treatment. The condition that landed him in the hospital was something called a necrotizing rescue virus, which manifests himself as a sort of creeping paralysis. The big gang in the street and worked its way up his legs to his hips to his chest, then from the fingertips to his hands. to his owners. Day by day, the loss of human progress, inch by inch, the movement of his extremities first became awkward, then impossible. The metaphor of battle became obvious as his body became a sort of war man. Reports of troop movements, propiled by the members of the house staff from the Immatology Serves, especially in dreamy dark eyed resin and crystal per specially right. Armed with malach and punes, he saw the wise good nature dream about. and prod and pinch and whack at my friend. All the while maintaining the guys in front of the conversation. Can you feel this? You move your toes. How about grassing my human? Good. This for wanted to comply with the instructions for a curtain. The terrain of battle was becoming unhumane or to him. The fog of war was obscuring the landscape. It was losing ground. They tried something popped. plasma choreyces, whereas blood was removed in the film. He said it was to remove the bad tumors. All this further weakened his defenses in the germs to prevent the cracks in the rare parts. Now about this warm and fun, the US military has in place in this moment a plan to fight two wars at once, or to fight one big war in two major theaters in action at the same time. Asking the US military to fight three wars at once would be asked in a month. They've set us in each. So it was with my friend. Besides the creeping paralysis and bugoms but, Christopher required an ammonia, relatively rare type of ammonia caused by sudden negative burners. Here's the odd thing about seeing the most of us live within their bodies all the tongue. Hour by hour we successfully applied it off. Most of us are winning that little battle right now. But people  Christopher, people with immune systems damaged by HIV. They ended up dying of a bug they've lived where all they learned. His pneumonia got progressively worse. His lungs so filled with fluid that the bitter leaves changing gases. It was because his pulmonary function was so poor that the decision was made to withdraw treatment into a lab in the dark. That was his wish that if there was no real hope for meaning on the cover, let extraordinary treatment be discontinued. So I'm spending the end of my life. some three months and three person in the hospital. His parents and his loved so much from about 20 of his friends stood around his bed in the ICU as a technician turned in the oven and went in the lab and to breathe in the air instead of a mixture of artificial and rich and toxic heat. He stopped taking breath suns and on the sheenia later. Even though the ventilator was pushing there in this lungs. Minutes later his heart rings. then the monitor by this bed folded in the lawn and spat out a stripper paper. Two minutes later another one another stripper paper. A minute later one last stripper spilled on the machine and curled to the ground. I was seeing someone wondered out loud that he was in hospital. I took it home. It says Christopher Rose 26 March 1998, $19.53 a system. Below that is... flat-worn drawn across the earth of the ground-fifteen. They all just sat there for one. There is an unmistakable look and dead body moons with in just a couple of minutes the color of the body changes. The skin turns ash and aluminum-ness and gray. You can see why people have always believed that something is left upon Spirit. Luah, Numa, Sol, there's no accident we see and someone has inspired. Some people walked out of the room, others stay in the state for one. I found myself wondering, how long will it survive? How long will the HIV, the virus that falls on this? How long will it stay in line under that dead means skin? I had the distinct and odd feeling death is a gradual pain. or process . The person is set to have died and then death begins in earnest at the soliore alone. Once the circulation of blood stops, the cells are deprived of oxygen and they begin to learn. But how long were the HIV continued to live after the killed exposed? It did some research and it turns out the best guess is that the human meaner deficiency virus can survive for mean days, post-money, conditions preserved in the laboratory conditions. Patacone to the National Society and Peshis diseases. The truth is we don't know precisely how long the virus survives in the summer. In my tiny blood rather than prickling but live in a pocket in the screen for instance for a little while longer. We know that outlifts the host for a little while but not that long. Perhaps less than a week. Which brings me to this question. Is it worth it? But extra week in a dead-nearest blood, is it worth all the poverty? Is it worth it? Pitching or what? for the better part of my friend's life, being the source of endless anxiety and pain, only to outlive him by a week at the most, maybe on the birthday or so. It hardly seems working for me. Christopher lived his entire adult part of this hanging over his hand, waiting for this to happen. In the bug room, I then death from him all.
