Everything around that core gets bigger and bigger until finally can't believe the biggest in the smallest of anything to do with each other, the one is so bloated and the other so tiny. At the beginning of this story, the box parents are married and in love, and both prepared to live far from everything they know to be with each other. At the end of this story, they may still be in love, but they're dead. divorced and an ocean apart and not speaking. And the bark is caring for his mother the way it has been heard. OK, Margie, Miss. And then give you a lot. What do you do, you call it? The bark starts Margie's shower and he's holding on to her She won't fall and she's holding on to him too. She's about five feet tall, naked and fragile looking and very pale. He's dressed in jeans and a shirt that he knows about to get really wet. All right, lift him press. Look at one of the times I can wash under it. Okay. Hey Margie, was it hard the first time I've already given you shower? I thought I could be very busy. How did you get over being embarrassed? I just got to have this over and over and over and over. Margie, it's hard to let me know. You get to wash cloth in under the breasts and just stand so we can wash it. It's a moment so intimate it's hard to wash. watch, but then as he gets her out of the shower and is drying her off, there's another moment that makes the intimacy of everything for it's completely beside the form and print up and compare us. He takes a baby wipe and wipes her back for a full baby shower. Well, it takes a lot of time with her alive and with her alive and with her sex. Well, there's a shower. It's a shower. There's a shower in the shower. There's a shower in the shower. It's a shower. It's a shower. It's a shower. It's a shower. It's a shower. We have tried. Margie's only 66, but in the last couple of years she's had a hard attack and two small strokes which paralyzed her right arm in effect of her memory. It cuts in and out  falter wiring. Sometimes she's talkative and remembers a lot. Sometimes she's not and she doesn't. She doesn't want to be a stripper for me so that we can make sure. how to have a rash in it? I mean, we don't think so. We're going to make sure it stays dry so it doesn't get her rash. I'm a work, is this closer than you ever thought you'd get to an adult woman's body? You could say that. But this is the end of the story. This is today. Let's go back to the beginning. The barred's family didn't really notice that he was, as he tells it, a big scissy, because they were all odd balls. No matter where they were living, at least one of them was always not quite fitting in. Margie's from Georgia and with most of them married by Peter. up north or middle east. Who barks father, Sabar is Palestinian, or an injured, but for most of the married, they all lived in a small town in Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of civil engineer. Now, if New Barrett was a cissie, in white working class, Catholic Hershey PA, Sabar was too. We get a week off of school every week, because so many people, so many boys went hunting in the field of hunting. And of course, , I didn't go hunting, I didn't play any ill football, and I didn't do all of those things that, , the boys in the neighborhood, who's supposed to do, especially Hunter Hunting, was , , a yardstick of when you reached Manford. Sober meanwhile, to Mubachine and Har had to call in neighborhood dads to do simple mechanical tasks  uncoving train. And Margie was the one who hung up. wedding pictures because Sabra claimed he didn't know how to handle. No, Sabra did do any of that stuff. Sabra was always very formal. He always had a sports jacket. I remember cutting grass was a big deal out there. Lawn care of how green and how even and how perfect which you're yard. And then I remember Sabra was in the yard cutting the grass. and he was kind of from grass and he had a sport coat and a tie on. He was just funny and he didn't think about it. And why would he do it? He didn't think about it. That came from the Middle East idea that if you are educated, that there's a certain position that you have in the sign, that you should always look and have a certain way. You can see why in this atmosphere, subvert one point panicked and made Marju's sign the barric up for a little way. Toughen him up, he told her. But mostly Marju says, subvert worshiping barric with the word, \"'Luvvar, this, and the bad, and the other, everything talked about was mvw. it was sad, ginging him in a grave and In the heart with the magic. Marci was the one who made the phone call to move on after finding a bunch of gay adult cards in this room. He was 20 years old and staying with friends in Germany at the time on his way to a semester in England. And it was the middle of the night. I don't remember if we were exactly in bed and the mother came down and said in German, my friend. There's a phone call from America and it's an emergency for your American phone. So  Zoner was then I went upstairs and had a close body. She was crying. She was hysterical. And she said, I said, Margie, what's wrong? She said, you have to come home now. And I said, why? What's wrong? She was kept repeating. You have to come home now. And I kept trying to get out of her what's wrong. So she finally said, we found a good hospital in Tennessee that she got a TQ. And then I knew what was wrong. Kind of a psych poker that I wasn't. Coming home until the end of the semester, and I would see her, Jane, and I think I hung up right in the way. This was the beginning of their world starting to shift, and become something else. Sovereign's margin from a barricade, sovereign who never raised his voice before, to pound the table and say, me, barricade was gay because he was a mama's boy. I didn't think I made the same person. He used to be jolly and gay and cheerful and fair jokes. I didn't know him. I guess he didn't know him. He was in such bad shape that he had taken off time from the university. I think he took a whole semester off from teaching at the university. He was so bad at one point he would sit and slight stare into space and not respond to conversations and questions and they had a home health care I Four of them all because they When the barric came home around Christmas they all sat down at the kitchen table for family and Marjee didn't say hardly anything And we the did I actually saw her did It was. Basically, he started with, , your son, we love you, but this is wrong and this is an illness where our doctors, , lives looked into it, and their doctors are saying that if you just try if you get help that you can change, . But you say the word. Oh, God, now he would never say that. You're condition or your problem or your situation. to be never safe word gay. Never ever ever. But even in the years after them, never ever seen them. The biggest problem for Barth and Gag is that he would never have children. He would never have a son to carry out family-made, the sovereignty of the son of his father who died. This was the Barth's obligation. After a long argument, the last thing the son of Barth said to me, I remember he said, looked at me. He said, I will sell all the land in Palestine. Raise the money to send you to a doctor if you ever decide. And that's a, , being Palestinian and understanding how important land is, land is identity, it's a future, it's the past, it's every, and for sobber to say let's keep. cell, all of his life showed that this was really his hot priority. His whole life. For two years nothing changed. The Barclay State and School in Kept being gay. Sobber stayed depressed and wrote the Barclay long letters saying, love the Barclay, but the Barclay sick, he owed it to Sobber to get help. Margie quietly began flooding the Barclay's college mailbox from Congress. Margie and Sobber moved back to me. least, is it always planned to do when Saburo tired? He was 65, she was 59. Six months later, everything shifted again. The family mutated again, becoming more what it would seem to have been less than half before. It started with metaphor and called to move on. Well, I mean, the way I first found out about it was I got a telephone call one after talking, from March. She said, And do you think I could come live with you? And I was, I didn't know what she was talking about. I said, Margie, what are you talking about? So said, do you think I could come live with you? And then she told me that she and Saba were getting divorced because he was going to marry another woman and have another son. In fact, divorce wasn't even what Sabah wanted. At first he asked Margie if she would be his partner. In what he called, don't you? Or would she be a hit, make fun? A young lady, you think you can fit long with. She said, well, she said, I want to marry another woman and have a day. I said, okay, so I'll be. You better find one, you think you can fit long. killing yourself stars. And then  she went through the Plans A and the Plans B was having another wife at a different part and then Plans C was him getting married in the West Bank, just going down her couple weeks year. Basically living with parts to her. Her response to that sounds different to the cheers. She said okay let's find as long as I can have a boy. So one last talked. So when we tell Asma Hora, I can do them, I'll tell you the same thing, you've been doing all you were there! You didn't appreciate that, you didn't? And I remember Saba wrote very, very long letter in explains what he was doing, why was doing it? And how he had been forced into this years he had been asking me to go to help and I was just ignoring him and he felt that it was... his, for since I was not going to have a son to carry on family name, that the responsibility of making sure that the family name survived suddenly being his again and this was the only way he could seem to do it and he was very heavy on the, this is your fault you were doing this, RG, not me, the other, that's will. strange as he spent pages saying, , try to keep your mother is being very closed minded about all of this. Try to convince her to stay. She doesn't have to leave. I don't want her to. So, Robert divorced Marchie, telling her every day until she left, who left her and didn't wanted to leave. And she got on the plane and began the life. She's been pretty much living now. From that point on, instead of a husband, she would have a son. From the moment the plane touched down, the treated her the way he walked and husband to treat you. And he'll get the lock thing off, get my plane. And then got the post-demonstration notice. Also, it was great, make love to fly out. Somebody was holding me up and I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Instead of saying something, something, you!! Let 1T to 1T!! both pay a flowers and kiss and that was. Well, I guess it's... Martin moved into Mubarak's graduate school apartment, which by the way was the same university for Sabr Fittar. In her old life she'd been supported by one man, her husband, her best. In her new life she was surrounded by holes to see on to Raj. Mubarak's friends were always coming in and whisking her away to the orchestra at the place they'd worked. She's still cried every day, many times a day, the first few months. And every day she got at least one letter from Sava, sometimes two. Finally one day the letter that came from Sava said, got married. Who barked, not knowing what was in the letter gave it to Margin went to his room. Came back out and it was five or ten minutes later. And she was still sitting there, she had a funny look on it. So I said, are you okay? Which started saying something Please don't hurt me please don't hurt me and quiet And Marci wouldn't talk to me don't come in closer don't hurt me closer don't hurt me She didn't know who I was She didn't know who she was Her amnesia the bar calls it a vacation from bad news lasted several days More in Margie's cardiology so she's about to surprise me. On the last day I spent with Margie and the bar. She suddenly murmurs that she wishes and bar I could not marry. You can bar her married. You can. March down there. , most mothers who say, oh, I wish my gay son that I'm married. And rest on who? They don't say a male. There is a Marx down there. So you don't wish me where I could marry any girl in the... You should be more watched on you. First, I was in the house and you were in the bathroom. Even after all the time I spent with her, I had completely expected her to say a woman's name. Because even though it's common when men try to escape, for the mothers to be more accepting than their fathers, they're usually at least some pretty girl in the mother's room too. certain ways they're used to seeing the world and just can't give up. But March's world and the barards are not really separate because they often most get people in the Paris. The barards were implied she's here. He says it all the time. And he spends a lot of time with March. Really happy. He's the only person I know who seems as unambiguant in his love for his mother. And she is in the love for him. Every once in a while who talks about something I know he thinks about. a lot which is that this is the end of March's life and he's grateful to spend here and we can do it. Okay, are you okay? You're , robbing that for me. Margie? Margie? Margie talked to me? What is it? What's happening? While I was keeping, Margie had but seemed to be a small stroke. Margie. Margie? Margie. It all happened in about two minutes. And when it was over, Margie seemed fine, although disoriented, I, she couldn't really remember what had happened. We were more shaken, she was. Bar, my talk to catch an afterward, made Margie seem to, this is really scary. It's so, so, frankly. because she was so scary, she got a lot of sleep. She's , remember the first time I moved, and she had been just about to. And you don't know what that means, you're here here in a panic. And then I remember the other two times going into the hospital and thinking, she is here this time. But every time I move, it's a good scare. You're curious, you think you're one step closer to something. Really awful, I have to be a mess whenever anything grows serious. We just did that because we need your gonna be taken according to that. All right, Marty, you can have a little heart failure to get itself through. Just do what you can, I mean. Whatever. I'm so scared all the time. Anyway. Yes, it might not be clear from the story, but I think it's hard to really wrap the song. I think he really loved her. We saw it clear as day, and the pages it for wedding scrapbook. She turns to her picture from her wedding day. Sobers embrace and marge you. And both their eyes are closed, they're smiling, they look completely happy. Probably not even web pictures be taken. What are you thinking? Where is that moment? I'm not that man. He's mad now. Mama, the hotel maybe you found that woman maybe. You might be here. Where are you? Jesus didn't love me. And then what is it? I didn't know sweety. I thought embarrassment wasn't. Because the crow was fascinated me. The crow had been fooled. The crow, Cat, and Cat, and Cat. What to do? All the pain, nothing new. You just can't stay. Act 2. Instructions for Saces. Well, I'm joined here in the studio right now by John Conno's who often provides music for our program and us, forms around Chicago. And you've brought in a book with you, the name of the book is, How to improve your personal. It's written in huge, Black letters on the cover. Well, it's a black cover with whites and sort of this song. Would you call that a daisy, no one? Yes, daisy, I would. And it was funny because walking down the link and having it, it's really funny how people sort of look at you in this odd way when you're carrying a book and how to improve your personality immediately or your suspect. They wonder what's wrong. But, and then , I of course. , turn the book so no one can read it. So I'm thinking I'm so insecure with my personality. I don't want to talk about that. There's something wrong. Alright, in this book has an important lesson for us for our program today. Alright, today and up for... Why don't you open it up here? This is from the chapter, Good Pyrrins. From the section, other appearance factors in men. Copyright 1942, reprint 1950.

Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. And  I could see people taking the road. I mean self-help books are still the same. But when you picture this guy in the 32-year-old, feminine, feminine book and thinking, okay, where is he? And who is? Please, probably still living in home. Probably, , the unmarried 30-year-old who is last-ditch effort used to be. proved to everyone that he's not the cc that everyone thinks he is. And that there must be a formula for him. I picture this guy that's telling me, and he's in his bedroom, his parents' house, and he has remodeled since he was a kid. And , okay 1942, is he floor-app is and go to the worst event he won? Yes, you're putting the war factor into this, I mean, you have. Maybe you have somebody who's in their early 20s who can't get into the war because he is so a family. I don't know. I mean, I seem to have documentaries of gay men in World War II and I think we're probably gonna find a match for him to take pretty much everybody. And there were the famous gay battalion. Exactly. We're at one in the France first. No. I'm not an actress. I'm the actress. Because they were the one who gets good French. And it's a gay battalion. Yeah, it's rated the lingerie shops and redesigned all the clothes. It's redecorated the whole place. So the Germans didn't want it anymore because it was just too slow. We've got to stand here and it's hard to fluff it. We're John Conners coming up more sysis in the house and savage many people without crunched the sender to their child at all. This is American Life My Reclass, each week in a program of course we choose some mean when you got to mention these monologues, so group conversations found in the app, found text, anything you can think of, from that day's program, Cicis, we've arrived at a three-ever program, and Cicis, Cicis, and so on , and we've arrived at this question, why do Cicis treat people out so much? What is the big deal in you guys? I want to give you that there are two things story months. First of all there's the idea that they're weak. Right? And since everybody is at one point or another in the life, fear being seen as weak. You can be painful. Do you see somebody else's system? Second is the fact that they cross gender crimes. Sissy's. This is a voice record girl's. That's the stereotype. Well this next story is about Sissy. got rid of half of that fun. He got rid of the appearing weak part. And by doing that, he was able to get away with cross-in-chern problems and acting more in-fragments. This is the story of Dave Hall, meant to these days, embraces. embraces isn't even, isn't even big enough for his relationship to his sister. He's a guy who founded something called the Panze Kings. Gans is a performance who goes show their country, Panze Kings, tell you. And she got her. Back in theory, I read work. you He was not so happy things. I got my leg broke in PE class. For wrestling, instead of matching people with people who were of their same strengths, they would match you with a guy who was your weight. Well, of course, I was this really fat, really, really heavy overweight kid. And the other guy who weighed the same of me was a sheet of beasts. He was this big, semi-unholk of the guy. And the PE teacher, perhaps out of coollessness, but also I think there was some knowledge toward ANZKID and wanting to see the ANZKID yet messed over. He has me wrestle with a brute, so it's me and the brute out there on the mat. And of course within 30 seconds I'm lying on the mat. And my leg is in two pieces. And I just remember that I was sort of mowning and crying, oh dear, oh dear, oh my, oh good luck with me. which had to be one of the great, probably the most planned to do, , moment of my young life, as I was carried out on the stretcher. Oh dear, oh my, oh my, oh dear. I got a lot of reviews especially in P.E. class because I was bad at sports, obviously that was important. The other kids, and they didn't want to have me on their team. I got a lot of insults in my heart. all way or people knocking my books out of my hands or whatever. And what happened is I started to develop a persona. And my best friend at that time was girl who went to another high school Lydia. And she was very popular. She was a punk rock girl. And what I did is naturally I started changing my look. And I got very first spiking punk haircut ever seen in East Peoria. The fact that this hat was real. strange because I went from being overtly and aggressively mocked to being really sort of given a wide burst. I went from being mocked, it's almost being seared because suddenly I was turning up in school with this weird spiky haircut wearing these baggy yellow trousers, all of madness, and vintage green suit jackets. And you got to understand that my high school walked down the hallways, it looked  a lover boy video. There's this very spiky specific uniform that consisted of a really ugly, slantle shirt, a black t-shirt hundred that could say one of five things and only these five things. Led Zeppelin, ACDC, Arios Speedwagon, Jack Daniels, or Harley Davis, and you could not deviate from that palette. Well, so I turned up dressed  a refugee from a Maddeness video or a David Bowie album cover. And to them, I just took a kind of schoolwork. I must be capable of anything. I had a friend tell me he had overheard these two senior burnout girls talking and one of them said something That day of all he's crazy He'd jump in front of a positive you told him to he looks  he could kill somebody Of course there is nothing further from the truth. I mean I was probably the only kid in that school who would never have taken a film my mother didn't give me and frankly, I was awfully cowed by authority, but suddenly I had this love. You were still assist. -huh. I was still assisty, but I was a different kind of assisty because what? The punk new wave, aesthetic allowed you to do, was the end. Drogenous in a way that was also kind of tough. You had this maybe died, funny hair, but you also had safety pin through your ear, and you were maybe wearing eyeliner, but you're also wearing ripped jeans and a black biker jacket. So... What it did is it could use them because it was sending all of these mixed signals. I could call it biomids and seepens and seepens. Well, at least a signal-up don't mess with me. I can take care of myself and I'm not afraid of you. I call it the squids strategy. You muddy the waters as an act of defense. You shoot out a lot of ink into the water and confuse them. And suddenly they don't know where to strike because suddenly they didn't think I looked  what they meant by a faggot anymore, which is someone who's really pathetic and behind you. because I also looked kind of tough and strange and yet there were these endrogginess elements. And the result is that they just started leaving me alone. I didn't get called, I didn't get any more in a hallway. I didn't really get called anything. And what I discovered was that while I would never have chosen to be feared on my own, once there I realized that it was a lot better than being mocked. The problem is I was still not dealing with internalized cystephobia because I was allowed to be in drugs and as I was able to go to where I make up work, , where ear rings or where, , big, flowery, paisley shirts, only to the extent that I had this cover of also having to safety in the ear or the rib genes or the spiky hair or whatever looked tough. And it wasn't until college or little after that I realized the real challenge was to be able to simply go out there  drag and does  without any of those balancing affectations of masculinity or toughness to really be a cissy  and go out there only only using the persona elements that are considered to be a feminine with something I was still very afraid to do. Winning essentially they are my favorite, some fact I think that's really tiring about which regidus is almost more deeply rooted. I think a lot of homophobia comes from its association with cicinus because the cicinus of breaking of those sacred gender categories is the deeper phobia in our culture. It would be much easier for me to walk down the street, carrying a copy of the joy of gay sex openly than it would be to walk down the street. in a pair of sparkly Ruby-Red high heels. , in this city, in this urban environment, I think I'm capable of doing both, but which one when I feel a little bit more inner self-consciousness or anxiety about doing, it would be breaking this issue in the area. They've all been surrounded by the hands who came to form this collective, and they've all been surrounded by the hands who came to form this collective. and posted the partly Dave show, every variety show from the show. The other one, the deer not speak its name. Love that we're talking about in the sacked is the love of Sysix. We'll be looking at the politics. Seattle. Another disintegrated sex advice caught on savage love. The answer of it says that he's about hundreds of games, thousands, enough that he can stay definitively. They must them do not act  six. Which he says is a shame for him. Because he loves six. My boyfriend is kind of a sister. He hates it when I mentioned it. When he finds out I said it on National Public Radio, he's gonna be killed. But he is kind of a sister. He puts he likes laundry. He's in the fashion and Brit pop and Barbara Streisand. All that's okay with me. I hate to put. And if he wants to listen to funny girl, I'll default to my shirts well. And besides, it's really no sacrifice in my heart. I think Sissy's sexy. Those Sissy isn't the right one to it. Little boys who play with dolls and sisters. Roman who went to see the mirror has two faces on the morning and open. Love it. Our known and gay slang at least as a spat. My attraction to Femi Guys is rooted I have no doubt in the high school experience. At St. Gregory the Great where I spent my sophomore year there was this senior, totally Femi and Gay and out of the closet and this was in 1979. He dressed in Kmart disco fashions and wore his hair long and used eye lining. St. Gregoryx was a dumping ground, all the kids kicked out of other Catholic high schools with being bad students or hoodlums wound up in cracks. These were not kids who instinctively honored diversity. These were kids who beat up systems. But no pounding could stop St. Greg's only found. When Gandhi would be back a day after a beating defiant in his set of paths, with his hair feathered back  barrel faucets. No punch, no put down could stop him from talking loudly in the cafeteria about the bars he went to, and man he dated, the trouble he'd seen. He was very family, but he didn't want to be a woman. He liked being a guy and he liked being gay and he liked everyone to know about. As a miserably closeted 14-year-old sophomore, I desperately wanted to be a gay varsity sat-man, so I wanted to date men, I wanted to see some trouble, but I wasn't brave enough for strong enough for courageous. This family senior, he was all those which things. He displayed more courage when he walked into St. Greg's every morning than I've ever displayed in my life, which is why he had such a crush on. Of all the tough kids at St. Greg's. He is absolutely the toughest. Which brings me in a roundabout fashion to the person. Being attracted to fans and willing to admit it makes me something of a rarity among gay men judging from their personal ones. No one seems to  femme guys much. When the personals in the village voice the Chicago reader in the SF weekly, every other voice seeking a boy winds up his head with no fats, no fems. or the truly appalling straight acting straight appearing. What? What is that? I don't have a problem with no fat smoke homes. That's just month. But straight acting and appearing. What does that mean, is that? Straight acting and appearing guys don't read gay personal ads. Do they? Reading gay personal is a very gay acting thing to do. And responding to gay personal is a very very very gay acting thing to do. Practically the gayest action demand can take sort of having gay sex. Having gay sex. sexie, owning the soundtrack to gentle. When a person, a gay person, but straight acting straight appearing in his ad, and mind you, it's only in about one out of ten ads, he's saying that Gainus, in and of itself, is unattract, undesired. A few years ago, the stranger, the paper I worked for in Seattle, launched a personal search. Being the sex guy at the paper, the person who became my response in the book. I ran the section and got... decide what was and was not comesher. And the first thing I absolutely bit was straight acting straighted per person. Some of my straight acting appeared co-workers, he also actually straight objected. Nothing else was banned in our free room in personal section leading straight acting, reach the PC sensor. After pitching a hissy fit in the staff meeting, he'd very happy, he'd run away, on my way. We wouldn't run ads from a black woman seeking right acting black men and we're shouting. We're doing it. guy seeking Christian hearing Jewish women would we? Most of my straight-up hearing co-workers saw my point, the rest were willing to let alone Sicilian staff make a call about what was a token different. As a result, the stranger is so far as I know, the only paper in the country gay or straight that will not allow gay men to advertise themselves are straight-acted straight. Not that something hasn't taken its place, something has a monster of my own creation. You see at first if someone sent in a straight acting ad, we'd run the ad just without phrase, but sometimes dropping the phrase left a hole in the ad, so we would very occasionally substitute the word masculine for the phrase straight act straight up here. The word caught on, and now it's in almost every ad in the boy's seeking boy's section of the strange impersonals. What you don't see much of in the personals are men looking for them. guys. An ads placed by guys who admit to being familiar with rarest, since admitting to being femme has all the lure admitting to being a pet slob. Here's an interesting moment. Blackmail, secure, straight acting, in the closet, fed, seeking boyfriend. Wow. Coming across to this ad made me feel  a birdwatcher who just spotted some rare tropical parodermen york and soylco. A straight acting pet. How do you pull that off? Here's another ad from a guy who risked describing himself as femme. They white male, 5.9, 150 pounds HIV-native, attractive, mildly feminine, seeks relationship with gay male around 6 foot. I decided to give him a call, his name is Mark. When you say feminine, what are you trying to tell people who read the person? I'm not, masculine, I'm not straight acting. I want to clarify that because it's sick as me when I'm straight acting. What is that? because it seems really self-hating and I'd rather not just define myself in terms of the straight culture. A few encountered guys who didn't  the fact that you were mildly feminine or guys who wouldn't date you were had negative concerns. Some guys who freaked out because you listened to Barbara Streisand or something. I don't know if I would say if I'd negative experiences but I definitely think that, well I'll say that a friend of mine recently. that he thought that I would get more days than I had it for more. What does he want you to do? He wants you to talk  this and . He wants me to talk  this all the time. , and... And that doesn't sound  it would be you. That's not going to be comfortable with you. No. But you think so you'll get more dates if you do that. Correct. Do you think you'll get more dates if you pretend to be butcher than you actually are? Well, I think that in the gay community it's something that's what you're right now that is... ...desired. Correct. Fortunately, I decided to call a couple of guys who took up personalized describing themselves as a straight acting and appearing. I really wanted to know what they thought they were doing. They thought it meant to be a straight acting. Here's one. Bodybuilders, let me check you out, TZU and FUNZ. You'd be daring. closet type. I'm straight acting, closet, 30 something. I'd never spoken to a straight acting closet by sexual and poor. I gave him a call. What's straight acting? Well, definitely not, , , in the case, , all. , straight acting, I just, , I, , I go out with women. I have girlfriends, case, so I don't think any of my friends with special, I have , , What if a really sexy looking guy who was really bunch of really masculine answered your ad? He was from adolescent, who was a little off the amendment. I want to point you draw the law. You're two of them. They would be hard to tell you exactly where I would draw the line because these all pressure personal things. First, the, when you talk to somebody, you might see this thing, whatever. So, If a gay guy who was feminine but could act but we're respond to your idea you might think of going out with him so long as the whole time you were together you could keep it out you could keep acting sort of straight and appearing straight even if he went home and put on  ladies underwear and this and the Vicky cars ride that'd be perfect you'd be okay with that yeah this fear of the consequences of coming out maybe what part of what keeps you coming out with everybody that's not right and what do you afraid might happen well I want to freak out on my friends Because some of my friends are really pretty, they deserve it. Bigoted. Yeah. Exactly. So how does it feel to, I mean to Archie kind of align to them, Archie  a black person who's best friend is a blind white person who hates black people? Well, I never thought of it that way. I'm not sure I had a dream. , I mean it's not  I'm a silent person. So things are said, criticism's made. I saved this next interview for last because of all the guys who play a straight acting personal abs, the saddest to my mind are the out gay guys and every other way sound pretty together except that they describe themselves straight. Robert's at READS, seeking companion of about my age on professional, William build 37 years old, 6 to 220 pounds straight out. Looking for a guy for this street. excitement, friendship, fun. When you say you're straight acting, what do you mean? Oh, I just mean that it's a traditional, traditional, traditional, that you don't? What is the traditional stereotype? You describe yourself as a gay man, right? But what's the traditional stereotype that you don't think? What kind of guy are you looking for? Just kind of a regular person,  I think that I am. I work at... everyday, play hard, kind of eat up my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind. Beyond doing me, bar thing, the bar thing is now, you're down. What do you think when you see what the really is, that's the main thing, the government's main thing. Why do you think what did you do for a living? Let's give all-car fakirmen, Ileti and all that. One. And I need to put it through the day. I want to say, well, you have a job. And what's this, what work thing is? Right. Being a minority, being a member of a minority group, a racial minority, I think that it's really hard. I'm just one who or a lot more service. I think that you label yourself. It takes a lot of different on. When you were a little boy, were you a cissy? Yeah, I mean my voice didn't have mature. That. Are you picked on? Yeah. Do you think that that being picked on has any had any impact on your adult choices around being very, very private? I am a cissy. You want to take it far from a bar. So part of what keeps you inside that realm of acceptable behavior then is sphere of being picked up or being labeled or victim of an anti-gave violence or but it's fear that right? Yeah. So in a way when you see someone  really swishy on the street, isn't that great? of them. Ah, not always. Ah, see, not  you've heard of them. We're the coming from a, , I don't know if you can push in and then you have to see in them and they get out of the gate map. Then you're free to do that, but I don't think that you're in such a big, free, but you can keep that, you live for a very, , climate world and things happening to all in. of the impu a situation that badly happened. I don't agree with Robert. The way I see it, the bravest of all the guys I talked to was Mark. The guy who described himself as family's personal. Mark and that brave swishy scene where I had a crush on it, same breaks, they both have the courage to present their real selves to the world of glorious cissis, which in the world that despises feminine men and boys is a risky thing to do. A brave thing. Now, contrast to their behavior with that of men who are straight acting 100% discrete ending the closet, or men who are constantly policing around behavior. These are men ruled by fear, fear of discovery, fear of femininity, fear of what it means to be who they are. They are the cissis. I'm not saying that the closet case who asked gay men not to respond to his act needs to be a big, swishy queen, , to do it yourself. He just needs to be a man, secure about who he is, man who is ruled by fear. a man willing to show himself. He needs to not be such a sister.
