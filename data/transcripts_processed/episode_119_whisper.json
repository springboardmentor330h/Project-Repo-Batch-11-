So, the offline sucks. Life in Brazil is not only different from life on the outside. It's a growing part of American culture. One of the fastest-scaring parts of this country. Thanks to top-recenting laws, mandatory minimum sentences. Conterms with drug defenders, restructing your outlaws, laws, balancing 12 and 13 and 14-year-olds into adult court, long adult sentences. Prison population is grown by 50% just in 1991. Moreover, a million people in the state and family. that are all present. Today on our program, there are lives and the lives of people close to them. Families get many millions of others. It will be easy to start off with a great year international, this American life, am I a class? Back one of our program today, I must be Texas. I want a little radio show in Texas is doing something for inmates and their families that no one else in the state is able to do. Back to Mother's Day. What do you say to a five year old who's mother is in prison? When he wants to know, is my mom a bad guy? Act 3. Use your daddy. We have a guide for new prisoners written by an ex-con. But how to choose a man to protect you while you're in the joint? And what you have to do is harm in exchange for that protection. That poor, open your big mouth. For a grandmas provides a case study that what happens when you go into a place. Listen. Whether or not to post about what you are never ever, ever, suppose to say, and what happens when you say every single one of them, I cry, color bar, form a set of that, political prisoner, break and break and knock, and that prison changes all of your perceptions, changes them in ways that last after your release. Stay with us. I met with Texas. I would do decades ago, not long after he finished four years in Texas prison for hours. Very no drifted from job to job. In the end it ended up at his local public radio station, APF-T and PUS. This time in the Slammer, in dreadful facilities, money or resources, turned out to be the perfect preparation for a career in public broadcast. And it was not running the place. As for the director he started his own show, that the Texas prison system, it has become the leading, mud cracking voice in Texas. break zone. and graphic corruption in the state, and federal facilities there. But it also does something else. Every Friday night, something that makes it one of the most unusual and remarkable radio programs in this country, though when Ray started , yeah, no idea. That's the same. I think the vision is why I can interview and judge me to whom local judges I knew, prosecutors, criminal, and so on. And that's all I expected. And again, we're seven hour in time. We were doing quite well with that, building audience. especially when you make. And the Monday I was coming into doing my show and I'm minutes away from show time and they said, are you going to talk on comments? They're looking for me on the air, , how are you? I don't take comments, that's close. They said, but she's very insistent. So I put to receive a maternity care about 30 seconds, what can you find? And what I heard was a disc rock on the voice and when they're saying say, a number of times, and there's samen with you. really heartbreaking play. She said that she'd been saving money for three years or so to get enough resources to get the to go visit her son and access her some kind and forced off the road. She wasn't going to be able to make it, but she knew he listened to my show when I played telling me, she loved her and that she would work to get resources. And I certainly realized. I do pretty damn good radio, but I keep doing radio just good and I'm so I don't even want to be in contact with you. After I did my English, I'm not going to run directly. It's interesting because now that is the entire show is people talking most of it, people talking to the loved ones. And they're obviously not even aware that I am gay or okay, , I want to welcome my people, I have something to say, maybe we're going to run on the talk to you, gentlemen. I'm John, this is good gay. I hope you've had a wonderful happy Christmas. I'm at home at my apartment now and I made the bring me home yesterday because I wasn't about to miss out on college. All right, Eric, Chris, let's go. Eric, Chris was standing just two weeks ago. You got to go ahead. Okay, Eddie, Daniel, this is Danny. You're not taking any questions and happy New Year's. I got to get from his time. Yes, I'm loving it. It's just me. I'm not going to go for a little brother. I give me a little jewelry pot, a little jewelry vest. you're a real big player that you put your rear air in, exactly in it really is real pretty. I want to tell you I love you, you take care of guys. Hi, Junior, this is Mommy, how you doing? I hope you had a real nice, very great luck. We'll give tomorrow morning for a little bit early, so we can see tomorrow. I did. I, I, I'd  to school  a schedule. I'll be in shock. Yeah, bye bye. Spain. So, okay. So, what's up? How you doing? What's up? Okay. Kind of cold. But, , that's a long way. Great. It's one of why these people would cover the vision and spend some big calling directly at one call from the local museums. In Texas, we don't know who comes from some questions. It's a right now of the President in Texas. There's no way I can end up calling. Well, if you're a prisoner and if you're a... trusty in Texas President and we are very very good in the day when we get one opportunity to tell a thing called for five minutes every day. And we're doing a brief one  my call, and we're here to call at all. This is Marty. She had a very thankful day for Thanksgiving. I was just thankful that I survived Texas. I do as my whole heart. So what's it big? 车 factor- gravity is Mario TV. So, I'll be home. So, what do I do? This one's wet, no, I'm wet, I'm dry. Oh, really? I'm sure the home part. I'm sure. But , one of the things the strike movement is how it's almost  a real conversation and it doesn't because of no exactly sure what they were saying. He mentions the charges in the talk, dual mercies, not in the unusual talk. music quieter because of sound. Let me ask you to talk about the brain. of what's calling soon. Well, almost a third of the calls are honey we've made a home all right. We're going to visit Sany. Hi, this is Claudia from Houston. Yes, ma'am. I was calling for my husband's season as well. Are you in it? Babe, I was calling. I'm not going to be able to come this weekend to stay put me to work. I wasn't able to get a week enough. I was thinking of come to see Saturday, but I wasn't able to. I want to say Mario this weekend, but we had to go all my man's. I went to Erzie to be kind tomorrow, okay? Because Sandy will be coming to see you. I hope that you radio is not right now, do ? Kay and I aren't going to make it this weekend. Mr. Littleheart, she got her a job, and she is staying home and going just for it. Another third in the comments are people for whom this is the only thing. people who can't afford. I don't have the resources even if they  made it to Huntsville. From Houston, then what have to use  a cabin which is 70 or 80 bucks to get from downtown small town Texas out to the prison and they just don't have the kind of resources to do. Hi, this is Carol and I'm saying this is a high end. We're coming back to the Illinois court. Hi, so we love you. It's my time, John. I got your letter. I'm glad you let it all off your chest, but right now there's no way I could move back to Houston. Was that good? But maybe once you get out, we'll know that I can act in. Yeah, okay, this is the end. And leave you alone, you may. I am Kugadhi. I've got even one as an upto plant to get all this. Just hanging there, isn't it? All right, Merry Christmas. And the remaining third or incidental conversations on people who don't call in regular, the first two thirds of people who call in regular, I'm not usually, I'm not usually, but occasionally they call in matter. , Johnny, this is your sister, she's in London. Does that say happen to her? That someone will call to harm someone as imprisoned of love for her husband's life? Well, I read it, it even worse than that. The prison shell will inspire us to hear voices that over one can turn, and we can reach. I read the one that comes to mind is in this quiet, on her son. Just  you've directly made the third total product of cutting up the excess and casezinho principally of this movie by Enn Andrew, who is the author of the independent government in camouflaged seasons, in a ganze snow I'm realizing that this is some of my ...this two-eda, change what? Let's now, yes, we did teacher later today and I did have more jobs about two weeks and I put talk to each body, but I did put the calls through and now, let's go, I wrote this moment, Alice, and Merry Christmas and we'll be together next year. Hi, I'm just me, Theresa. I just sort of got a little bit of bad news, I'm not sure. But I think I told you in my letters that I was born. I think it was my mom and my stepfather and his stepfather. Well, I'd be at and he's not real great. Of course, , they offered the car, but they also offered the other things they've told me about. Well... It's an either or situation, no one I'm talking about. Please, I hope  what I'm talking about. Great, let me ask you, what is she talking about? Point we have here is the radio prison show equivalent to the dead. And reading to one is prison, it's called the civil war. And these been struggling, and this was the prison prison, and so it was thanks to the dead and So people will just look off and break up with their boyfriends and spend over the radio. And I get everything. I get years. I got the letter you intended that other woman. And what we have here is we have a male officer deciding this guy is one of the shamans. and there's two, maybe a woman male officer. So the best way to fix that is just to switch the letters and the mugs. Is that happened more than once? And the whole guess that happened pretty regular. Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. I love you. And we miss you with all of our hearts. And we just are so grateful for your our brothers. We feel  we're the ones that are blessed. But are you saying you do? No. but we're the ones. They're the flesh to have you. David, it's me and you and it's honey. I love you and I miss you and I'm going to try it. I want you to know that I have a beard and I've been asking. I'm going to try to make it down there because we haven't seen me. I made you the big throw so I can't mess up when I'm not stopping on sight. I need to have you strength, strength, and now it would be okay when I come down there. We talked about some of the other people. Well, Blade Waters is a rough, kind of rough Texas accented Voldemort and very easy and then found some of these counseling in the conversation, some of Schwarzman. I'm actually Schwarzman. Schwarzman plays 300 mutants in the middle of every seven, but it's serious and more on each move. Oh, big, big, big, rough. He's not going to live, he's not going to get out into the world. Mom and Dad, just into the garden, in the town. What do you think is  sweetheart? To be called sweetheart, I was ready out of it. No, setting words. People are pretty mean and they can hear him being called sweetheart. Well, and he's science may be done. He's worried about me. Yeah. Yeah. He is... unit for this is designated for older units. In a broader sense, in general, what do  about what it's  for prisoners to have such intimate and set them and then they have it heard by a lot of people in the environment pretty poor not so open with each other? Actually I think I think that's probably the best thing that happens on, , and what's wrong with Putin is the additional question to sound. There's no caringness, there's no sharing, there's no signing. It's one to a box kind of scared and security lifestyle. And I think that's way hard and things  that breaks that thing. I think it's very helpful for inmates to come out of different cell blocks and getting one in childhood to listen. I heard you run last night and she sounded  she's getting better. I heard you dead, cop. this way hard. Very hell, close to the prison shell, where they'd be fighting night on KPFT in Houston. In thinking about what song, for an after-history, we decided to turn back to Edwider, jazz musician, who's been listening to this song. There's a song that I used to listen to all the time, that I used to listen to a lot more. When I was in Greta's work, I always missed a head of tape, God bless the charms, God wronged them. really hard at. And what it meant to me when I was at gratitude when she said, , then this guy should get me a snush for the Bible says the steam is new. Mama may have a problem, have God bless the child and so on. Well, in my mind, a greater form, I thought that yes, I would be child and head, so because I was out here alone, I had no hope at time. There was no hope. I was snoring away. I was  a child. I was  a child. Because I had no one I can search in the pants that has no one I can turn and I thought  anytime I listen to that I thought that those shoes talking directly to me You guys want to hear it without any music But I'll get dark people or All right here What Speak .. & let's get this joke MANA k笑 This is a little cold but that's basically, yes. Back to you, my best friend. This is a person population rises, portion of female and it's sour and rise. We may not make up 6% from these people. And on Mother's Day, visiting rooms are packed, so that was the children's room. Man to coins made it to their netten, to see your system, John. It's about the time it comes here in the visiting room. I'll wait and teach the children. single flower in this picture. A rose to a darkening. Occasionally, a mother will pick up a present and bring it to a nose when one of the bears in the flower, the child asks she likes it. And the mother will respond the way that mothers always have and always will respond when present with a get in the stay. Oh, I just love it. It's perfect. I'll put it in my Bible or I'll put it on my desk right next to the sculpture. And always. most on you. But most of what is being smell today is the children themselves. While the other adults are plucking coins into the vending machine, the mothers take deep whips from the back of the children's necks, or kiss and smell the backs of their knees and take up their shoes and take off their feet and then pull them close to their noses. They hold them tight and take in their own second and then assuring them if these are still there children that they still belong to them. The visitors are allowed to bring in pockets full of coins and today that mother's day flower. And I know from previous visits to my older sister here in federal prison camp for women in the pecan Illinois. There's always an abrant urge to gather immediately around the banding machines. The sandwiches are stale, coffee week, candy bars and ones we always pass up in the convenience store. But after we hand the children over to their mothers. be gravitate towards those machines. milling and kitchen art party, we all do it in open as well. All my sister Jennifer is with her son in the playroom and inmates mother comes over to introduce herself to my younger sister, charity, my brother John and me. She tells us that visiting her daughter and a higher security prison before she was transferred here. Woman looks old and tired and it's all to say. I'm going to be back under the weight for recently acquired bitterness. Pitta fire, she says, she can help. a Pitta fire straight in hell. I've seen anything  it. something out of an old movie about business. Her voice is getting louder and she looks at each of us pretty nice. My daughter was in there. Don't even get me started on that place. We didn't die there. John and Churdy and I silently exchanged glances. My daughter would come to the visiting room with a black eye and I think all she did was sit in the car while I'm breathing. house she didn't even touch the stuff, never even handled it. She continues to stare at us each in turn. Ten years that boyfriend talked and got three years. She didn't know anything had nothing to tell them. They gave her ten years, they call it conspiracy conspiracy, aren't their real criminals out there? She asks this with hands-out stretched waiting for an answer to none of us can give her. The woman's daughter, the conspirator, is chasing her son through the maze of chairs and tables through the album's children. She's a 24-year-old blonde who will call Stephanie, who Dorothy Hamel here in matching dinner. She looks  any girl you might see in a shopping mall in the L America. She catches her chocolate brown sun and tickles him and they laugh and trip and fall together onto the floor and that heart. She has done the tour and her sons of Welsh Harholds and two. Here's spent weekends visiting this mother in prisons and Kentucky, Texas, Connecticut. No one last year can't, and I'm security- Ellie looks older than his age, the shoulders do not drip  his grandma's. On the contrary, his bitternessless thumb is chin higher than a child's should be. And the child  wide-eyed curiosity is in the face of his eyes. You can see his emerging hostility as he and his mother played together. She tells him to keep up with her and prove to him that he could put death cards away. His face turns solemn, which persists. She takes him by the shoulders. looks him in the eye and uses one of his hands to swat him. She grabs the hand and swat together. Eventually she pulls him towards her and smells the top of his head and she picks up a card to the toy herself. After all, it is mother's day, she sees him so rarely. But her acquiesce makes an angry ear and stalks out of the way. Toby, my brothers, is to try and share one another when not have the same thoughts. He is better taken care of. He is living with relatives and stats, made solid middle-class church on mountains. When he visits us, he is ants and uncle. We take him out for adventures, we will walk down the alley of the city and pretend we are being chased by bad guys. We buy him past food and his uncle John keeps him up, we will pass his bedtime, throwing the stories in our kissing room. to read. A perfect mix we try to convince when another. Until we take him to see his mother and on the drive back he asks the question that most confuses him and no doubt all the other children just send much of their lives and prison business. This is my mommy and dad town. It's a question that most seriously disordered to survive your old need to clearly separate right from home and because our need perhaps just is great just the question that answers as well. Now however answers will. to the simple, and a few years it won't be. And a few years we'll have to explain man-to-point minimums, and the war on tracks, and the murky conspiracy laws, and the enormous amount of money in time, the federal agents pumped into imprisoning low-level drug dealers, and those who happen to be defends in their lovers. In a few years, he will have the reasoning skills to ask why so many armed robbers, and rapists and child molesters, and indeed murderers are punishless severely than his mother. When he's older, we will somehow have to explain to him. the difference between federal crimes which don't allow for coal and stake crimes and stew. We will have to explain that his mother was taken from him for five years not because she was drugged in it, but because she made four phone calls for someone she loved. But we also know it is vitally important that we explain all this about the train or we understand the danger of abstract. anger. I've been disillusioned with your country the most of all we do not want them to inherit that much. We would still  him to be raised as we were, with the idea that we live in the best country in the world, the best legal system in the world. A legal system carefully designed to be immune to political moods and public hysteria. A system that promises to fit the punishment to the crime. We want him to be a good citizen. We want him to have absolute faith that he lives in a fair country. A country that... watches over and protects its most vulnerable citizens. It's meant in its children. So for now we simply say, Toby, your mother isn't bad. She just did a bad thing. when you put rocks in the lawnmowers, gas tank, you weren't bad though. We just did a bad thing. Once after being given the speak explanation he said, I wish I could have done something really bad  my mommy. So I could go to prison two and be with it. It's now three o'clock visiting ends at 3.30. The fathers mothers just brothers and the few boyfriends in the very few husbands are beginning to show signs of gathering the trash. The mothers with the impents are giving their heads one last with, before tucking them and their paraphernal yet until the respective carrying cases. The visitors may end her towards the door, leaving the older children with her mothers from one last word. But the mothers never say what they want to say to the children. They say things , do well in school, be nice to your sister, be good for Aunt Elliott Grandma. They don't say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you more than anything else in the world, and I think about you every minute, and I worry about you with pain she straight to my heart. Pain's so great, I think I'm just burst and I think I'll be well. about me. We are standing in front of double glass doors lead to the outside world. My oldest sister holds her son, rocking him gently. They are both crying. We give her look and shudder. Sherryd and I grasp each of the small hands in the forest walk with doors. I turn that and I see what I do. of women standing behind the glass wall. Some of them are crying but many simply stare with days dies. Stephanie is holding both the person's hands and hers and speaking urgently to me. He's struggling and his head is twisting violently back and forth. He frees one of his hands from her grass, falls up his fist and punches her from his face. Then he walks with purpose with the glass doors and our hands and the back of her. still in a crash position, she stares, I'm blinking through those hours. Amanda Coin is a graduate student in nonfiction writing for University of Iowa. This was exepted from a longer story that originally appeared at Piper's magazine. 80% of the women in prisons today have children back home, thus to these women in their single minds.

Today's show, the tens of millions of people who've analyzed their tangled up with their nation's prisons and the spirit when we have rising rates in incarceration. on primaries. In the first half of our show, we heard mostly about family members prisoners in the second half of the half we turned to now. We turned to a few aspects of life for people behind bars in America. We'd be here with this item, this act three of our program at three, Fusion Dan. This is an excerpt from a pamphlet written by an ex-convict Stephen Donaldson, guide for straight men who find themselves entering prison. But one in before we start, this reading contains material that may not be appropriate for some younger listeners. There is no explicit language or graphic depiction. anything but it does acknowledge the existence of certain sex acts. Many prisoners who have been raped by fellow inmates or who have been threatened with brain decide to become hooked up with another prisoner. However, distasteful of the idea may seem, they believe it to be the least damaging way to survive from cuss. In most arrangements, Junior Potter and Prison Slingley Ketcher are called, gives up his independence and is control over his body to the senior Potter, the Joker, man, pitcher or daddy. Next year. for protection from violence and sexual assaults by other prisoners. This arrangement must be said is an effortlessly voluntary from the punk, but it is preferable to the series in violent gang rapes and in the age of AIDS, are seen. If you want to be able to choose your daddy, tell the other prisoners that you want to hook up. Worked around fast and guys were starting to talk to you about it. It has to be done quickly otherwise it will be over well-new and make it gang-wrapped before you can make a choice. Then as much time as you can. and chocolates and want to hook up. Ask them lots of questions and judge for yourself how to see her day on. Ask out your prisoners, especially poems, queens about their reps. More information you can get better, your choice will be. Once you make your decision, pretty much stuck. Check out how serious the guys discuss the aspects from you in detail and try to work out the most favorable at the end, even put it in writing. Detective pairing is very serious matter for him too, obligates him to produce life. on the line to keep you from harm. Ask them about any previous. Catch your seas ahead, have a managed together, and why they split. Any of them are still around, talk with them. Ask doctors how they treat their women, some of those doctors treat their punks the same way. They form real partnerships with their women, they're more likely to do the same with you. Doctors may well insist on having sex with you, or putting a flame on you. This is not an unreasonable demand since sex is such an important part of the deal. And tell them a lot of that. out of job by how he behaves with his section. It shows infections and just stroke his body, hair, his good indication that he wants to treat you  a human being.

If you decide to hook up, you might as well get used to that status. frequently loans out his palm to his friends. Usually a way of ensuring that loyalty to him wants to reinforce his position as a leader in a way. This is good for you. This is the more backup he has, the safer you'll be. And when he's not around, you can turn to his friends in an emergency. Once the two of you decide to be hooked up, you may well be getting dudes out of his sense. It's laundry clean, sell, make his phone, get his coffee for him, giving him back. Well, the arrangement is firm, which makes the way. rules and catcher follows them.

This allows considerable degree of give and take in non-sexual assurances of partnership. Sexual parts, please fix. can't really hop to get out. I have to understand, Jockers, the world of confinement, he wants constant competition. Everyone looking for a witness. Guys put up a false front, never admits any vulnerability. This makes them less human. We make it hooked up, and we have someone to relate to. And really you're on the same team. We're relaxed, they're on the trust. They may even show an entirely different, and unexpected side of themselves, sharing their own anxiety and spheres and deep. experience. In turn, they will listen to you as you learn to trust them and talk about your own.

Ask about such things for a certain claim to make it clear that pretending your muscle and identity is important to me. Some chocolate don't care. I was hooked up once with a guy who let me grow a mustache. Most will still refer to you as him in his male name. Others may insist to shave your legs grow long hair and use feminine nitties. No matter what you have to do, remember that it is all an act and you can go back to your normal behavior and soon as you can out. That's a lot of advice. You'll need it.

We get to this place where Frist, metal detector, led guns, all the first, smells of a hospital, heal,  a little kid in great school. that can be a school. Eventually we're led into this big change,  your high school. Four sets of bleach pulled out, little stage. Lichens packed about 800 to stop guys. As soon as they see us, it's  a scene from a bad person. They started whistling and cat calling and yelling, Ben number, woo, fresh meat. Apparently, it was made for us. But I'm scared. We're led into this little room. Let's be. Pompas is starting to guard, starts laying down all of it. You're not to mention homosexuality. You're not to mention broke use. You're not to mention black and white relates. We've had rides. Did he got very serious, said, fitting in mate crosses the yellow line in front of the stage. You immediately turn and run for the double doors in the back of the room. But don't worry, we got snipers in the bird. Oh, suddenly I'm at ease. Here that day, snipers and the birds, nothing to worry about now. What he's talking about of course, guards with guns up at least now. I don't know about you, but nothing says Chris is the org, guards with guns. Also, we were in supposed to mention guards, org, guns, org, org, org, org, org. Basically, you weren't supposed to talk about any, so this is not about the K-1. Which you didn't even know existed before, brought it up. This is where they get their guards' tools to, , this is the creep problem. Well, this nightmare gig begins with them announcing your house in MC Jose Salon Jose Rancor and I think it's just not overstate how horrendous this situation 800 guys not one of them was for all screaming at the top of the You you Ben over he's just awful. I mean, it's just awful And I'm watching from the side thinking It's gonna stop there. They're gonna stop nobody stop. Nobody trying to stop Is one of those right? situations and hopefully you've been waiting for this. I'm supposed to be paid 500 dollars. I want to gladly keep the 500. Here's 2,000 more. Let me go home in 2 and a half hours. I'm with my wife, please. Nobody in the room is laughing except for the government and I watch from size. Nothing fun here that another common eating at all today. Drill. Jose comes off, Drenston sweat. Felt him and goes out, tries to ignore the government today. Look, come on, these guys don't. Both they've been in prison there a whole lot. I have never laughed harder in my life. I'm just fusting a god watching film and he's got these good friends. So that's why you laugh. And he's got these jokes that are brilliant. Nobody's years. And then, not only dad, he's so beautiful. They start to grow and say, have these bags. They're not going to know cards or throwing. And I'm watching from the side. I can see this dodging. Occasionally he glanced at me. I'm down on one knee left. I think so hard that then he'd start laughing, causing them, I guess, to hate and more, and they throw more stuff. It was an ugly cycle there. Fellman comes off, he can't even look, he's staring down, just shaking his head. Then, else, mine, I drift, to where the stage is, I had to be up there for four times. And I took, my got to the stand, and who would stand over? Yeah, I'm on the stage. Do I know if I try my ass? they were there. So I'm wondering what to say in my indecisiveness, I think you've got personal protection. They started one. When they were totally quiet, I just got back from Haydlock. Boy is my ass sore. Oh they huged us laugh, I never just laughed. They're just roaring with laughter for about a minute. And while they're laughing, I notice that the entire sign over here is all. These two bleachers all white, powder scent. So I look at one of these white guys and I go skin, sir. If your dick was big enough, could you sit with the black guys? Ah! Oh the black guys are high five in their crying. I'm a god in the slammer all of a sudden. And I noticed a black guy in the front row, here in curries. So I walked over and I said, where are you going to Marrow? that you need to look better than tonight the big social event of your year. Well from then on I'm solid gold everything worked. what I said? I'm sorry my voice is a little more if I just vomited up a baguette pair or one for a friend here. I started talking about how my third dad had been in prison. Some guy in the back he else. Yeah I knew him. So I looked at him and said  you look familiar. I think your face is tattooed on his ass. That's some really fat ugly guy right here starts giving me food. I have everybody moved in, and get away from him. Then I ordered the guards to shoot him. At one point I actually started talking to him. I got off of the stage right behind the yellow line. Took out my wallet at $20 bill and I said, I'm getting it. Who's he? Dude, my boy. I end the night with a Christmas single. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Only the rapists now, let's go! Oh, it's part of this dude ride in a one or so, it's been , child molester, it's showing on it! Shake! Recreant notes, telling the story from this one man show, all grown up in that place, that was the CD from the other man's. And the G-L-House, the name of the G-L-House. MacBuy elevar are currently changed by prison great and great octaves incarcerated for seven years by the apartment itself after the dog we entered you change it is a way to work with the political He's a painter and a writer. But some ways is time in prison is different from most American incarceration, in one facility he was in, prisoner sang each night in the south. But in other ways, what happened to him is what's happened to many people, everywhere, over the centuries, in London, in the time. For the first three years, prison, I was kept in a very small area of all of myself. So I literally had very little to see, look at, in terms of variety, in terms of one of other people. I am used to receive wrongly people coming to come, if it is just coming to the blinds and those ones, one playing a race suit. Never seen further than say about 60 years of six feet away from the cell was 13 feet by six feet. That was the one special, field vision, and it was no fright in us in the vision. And of course, one you are suffering inevitably spawned. Right mean, it's difficult. So that once I said was going down and I had been aware of the integral, I remember I became aware of this when the transporter used from the Tory, the Cape Town Prison, which took place in those truck. And I then, there event was slightly open and I got fixed with it and see the landscape by its andiryn, the ash ash where shot can be bent on. The... the... the... the... the... irrelimable of the unstoppable... the... wearing weight. That time has one in Christmas, this form of words. that you are being changed, but that thing able to measure the extent of the changes. that you are in the existence of the process of degradation taking place. So do you have nothing against which you need this? You cannot fight it. And the same time you have no sense of time, but as a tool, because there's nothing to do with you. Time is a water and a transfer and it's good. The one particular person that I have in mind now, called Beverly You. We call the people in the story of its their hangings with the execute people after about two hundred per year now that has central characters the actual Chamber the room where people are executed But since if you live in that person you never see it you're interested aware of it's there you can hear it You can hear the room because you can hear the trap doors opening And sort of the shattering games that are building when people actually are being hanged in a morning, and then you hear the coffins being together, hearing this room on this enclosure, without actually seeing it makes a very mysterious heart, not in place. So you really have the sense of being in a lab runes. I think it's a real way in which senses merge there. Ar meidän me. see with your ears. Because I think that when you hear those sounds that was your threat, how the lab runs, in a sense that was the way you learned about what I've been doing. The quality also of what you were in that sense here, the quality of the voice to change when the new that I've been in the past, you were stunned. Until this part of that session looks, you that that does bring me behind a few days as opposed to something else being published that has to be much between us. And sometimes if it was anyone person due to behind using all by himself and by looking at it then it would be very sad because it would be , it would be much more melodic, kind of a clue which is the interesting or touching thing by this. That happened in month-first scenes, or by myself, in the middle of the night, due to being angry, I had a very strong feeling. You can actually hear the quality of the listening of the other thing. Do  that everybody else not listening to the way, lying there, listening to this kind of thing? Everybody's eating and we're trying to sing it song. This is really fun. You knew there's not a single person who is listening. You actually hear people listening, lying within their thoughts and the vast majority of the walls. Just let it try to communicate. Not because one wanted to alert people to condition you. But one wanted to alert people to accept that you were still alive. Because you were too talented, whether you were still alive. You sent you realized, but life's going on outside there. And the people with the closest in your are not even alive. , you went down the road to buy some cigarettes and you were sitting collecting it and people were whipped and , some time but then life is such that you must go on. So they both around the absence and they go on and they remember your birthday parents in the end or Christmas and correspondingly you stopped existed since then even you can't communicate. If it was hearing of רedy, really feeling on mypa particularly the sets we were cut before the last work you were to wear what was happening that's the most mischievous coming. You were experienced and the mischievous from the other side of the grace, another life, another life. Remember talking to friends and friends and saying, , while we meet again today. in your time and we mustn't forget and what it's  now. The fear that you would lose some of the things you were taught in person, or you learned in person. We knew that for instance, as you move away from the experience, the bad parts become obliterated and you'll look back on it sometimes even in the same style here. It's nice, we all jumped getting prison. That's the way they do it. in mind worksness. It's always hiding, always moves away from the tender from the roar. Which is nice, it's fine. That means one dies in glory, I'm sure, and I think we have had a wonderful life, and this is one big muck. The calmness and the prussian, all the no colors of the puck. places or sad but it places such as army camps and as opposed a hospital doing the war years and so on. In other words you see graves and metal talism you see a kind of off green with a bit of luck in the sea but a brand. Most of this infinite shades of gray and and dirty green with all greens cut out of the world. It's  if you cut out of it. somebody of colors or certain time and they introduce color. However small the area of color may be that introduced. There will be intense sort of a time of recognition that kind of a real experience that we live in a circle that of colors. We know a longer even notice we are still looking at in gross some un-funeral paper and the white cap. over a bit, the darkest mission. And this Lisa is so much glad we are, we are washed over with the richness of Camus Newton, but in the situation  that, we are in all of a sudden, this is the eruption of the top Iraq. Or the leader could blend over the globe, or even afraid that some are got blended or threaten tanks. and you cannot possibly imagine the intense awareness of experience that can at that time. As it is never sick, can you feel it? It makes of you a very nervous, very tight person when you are at the person because you are a whole percentage to sounds and colours. I will become too much. There are too many callers when I came on, , I couldn't take it all in a distance. And it was also gave me a strange sense of superiority. I felt  I was moving into a world of zombies. Now that was a complete ten-but, in prison  that you've led a new monsomesbony yourself and become a zombie. That is what plonten prisons in this test, you become a new yet. When you come out, you have a composite feeling of you moving a monsomesbony. These people don't really know what lasts, but they don't feel. walking in a street. They don't see the cameras. And they don't know what implications are. They don't see the people coming down to their table. They know sense that. They not alive. They antenna are not vibrated. And of course particularly they not even aware of the model implications are what it's  to be walking on the street. People. That puts you really out of step with the people who move a mum.
