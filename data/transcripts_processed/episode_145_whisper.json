Make course, flatter, drumsticks, white breast meat, stuffing in gravy, cranberry relish in the side. And in Daniel's family, have a name as well. As you can see in the phone, name for this meal is... TESH! TESH! Was that culture up here? Well, the B-D-E-Zs are a chance for you to learn young tart juices. it's not a warm beginning? ø!? Ba na ni National Sermical Life, Special Program today, and the wonders of fish. Actually, we can say the word fear, and the word is, poultry. And as , each week on our program we choose some theme, but variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme. And this week, as we stand now, that magical five weeks. the year that magical five weeks between the Turkey served at Thanksgiving, the Turkey served at Christmas, period when Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the Turkey consumed in this country every year, 67 million turkeys are eaten during this period and every year during this important time, this American life brings you yet another program about poultry. That's right, stories about turkeys chickenstuffs, battle of all kinds, and then mysterious hold over us. I'm Eric Glass coming up in this hour at one duckie, the story of a typical American family, imaginary poultry, and a hand puppet that do still live with chicken. What happens when a chicken crosses that thin yellow line that divides the animals that we eat in the one hand, the animals that we keep as pets. and the other three how to do the funky chicken true story of a multinational chicken company powerful enough to turn a white man into a black man and the man they chose to do this to no time to be their own spokesman or chicken diva yet another testimony to the power that chickens have over our hearts and minds my friend and aqua about chicken little families the western the would it from balls, sung in Italian and no kidding, able to make grown men cry, stick around and hear it for yourself. [\"Pomp and Circumstance\"] That one, puppy. So, in Daniel's family, power of poultry so great in their lives. When they serve, chicken or turkey, they call it, hey, that's right. And they call it this for a reason. And the reason is to do with a stop hand puppet called DACA. Now Danielle was a woman of her three years old sister Ashley is two years younger. DACA, spending the family's attention to each other. Well, , he was a Christmas present when Ash was about eight and I was about 10. And when he first tried, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful fluffy white back. And he had a- a cape on and black kind of villain's black hero goggles. He lost, he lost the outfit pretty quickly, anyone make it. And then he became an African vehicle for her. So, I'll try to make it. That's not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And his children. Daniel dominated Ash. Ash didn't go to Daniel fought to get her attention or approval. And Daniel always, always, got her way. Except when that happens. Basically Ash would channel. I mean, it's kind of an anacronism in this context, but she would channel.it. She would become that he's wish you would speak as ducky. And ducky was sarcastic. Ducky was so... selfish, boss that he would insult Daniel, that he would tease Daniel, that he would give her painful nose, sweaks. Whatever Ashley kind of brought back into the equation, she's completely adopted for, I would just put it into that. You may as well compare his personality with Ashley's personality. Ashley's right kind of considerate, she's very considerate and kind. and very, very, very, very, very few people. Very, very few people are happy. Someone else doesn't feel good or, and that he is totally , , what's from on chatative? , what's in it for me? In your say, totally out for himself, Simon Canyasley, a braggard and a total whim. He's both both. And they... He's just indomitable. Yeah, in a comfortable spirit. Alright, I've been in Danielle's apartment sometimes, and I've witnessed a flower and see her. Picture, please. Danielle is not spoken with her sister in weeks. She makes my phone calls Ashley and Muffigan. Ashley answers. Danielle is immediately. In Patekio, and then actually essentially, , becomes Ducky, puts Ducky on the song, Daniel talks to Ducky for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's all conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are Daniel is an editor at a Big New York Magazine. I do a Ducky. I really love Ducky and come to me. I think  if he disappeared it would really feel  someone died. I mean I'd look at him and he looks really kind of old and rattly and it really makes me sad. It kind of really, I feel  it's really, it's really, it makes me sad to think about a girl's about that piano and it would be a big empty hole in the world. He kind of takes up this much room in my heart. It's  a lot of people individually and I would ask. If he if something happened to him,  if he were  lost in an airport or kind of run over by a car I would be a little daily be hard break So I hope it's a make clear why if you dinner in the home of Danielle's family Is this serving some kind of poetry  chicken or turkey if you ask anybody in the family what's we dinner? They'll tell you is what? Freaks the he out. If Freaks the map though, you don't  him to know that perhaps birds are or a pet. I think he knows I think even denial about it. He isn't denial about most things. He isn't denial about the fact that he's totally  a week in tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good looking and strong. And ladies really smart and has got a friend. Right. Right. , I think denial about that. that he'd actually stop. Which he is. Some of the time I said, Becky, you'd  to just stop. But you let me know why. Now I thought I would try to book, Becky, come on the radio for this program. So I contacted Danielle Sister Ashley. And asked her, , did that he come? the air. I received an answer back. I've found but by electronic mail. That for Ducky to appear I'd have to first go through someone named Yonolu who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mother. When I talked to Danielle I asked her about this. I've been informed that the only way that I can reach in is by calling your mom and speaking to Yonolu who have that name right? Yonolu, yeah. I think that she's asking Yonolu is. She's a head top. Anything special that I should say to you in the room? To make sure. Well, she, I mean, I don't know. She's a pretty high bar again. Hmm. No? Hey, Mrs. Matoon? Yeah. It's I request. Hey, I request. Mrs. Matoon. Here's where I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio of that duck. And duckie. And f- contacted your daughter Ashley and she said that for me to look duckie onto my radio show I was going to personally contact Yona Wu. Yeah you wouldn't need to do that. And that I need to do that to you. Yeah who is Yona Wu? Yona Lu is so she's kind of up. She's a head talk to you. She's basically taken charge of duckie's financial affairs. I presume that's the coming to its money. Well, I don't know actually. I mean, that's probably why she said contact law group. Well, so what do I do now? I'm calling you she said I was called to contact you and if I want to get in touch with you on a real in order to both touch. What do I do next? Both touch, okay. You got to both touch. That's that's how I did. I want to both touch. So. Well, I'll just talk to you a little about it. She says, okay. I mean, we're young. will want to discuss terms or something? Tim, talk. So what's- Alright, should I call you back? You could call me back or I just go in and chat. , just going to chat. Yeah. Should I wait? Yeah. Alright, I'll wait. Abracadabri? How about the alphabet? Ah, I'll wait— I'd wait. It's just a teaching screen layout. I was right about that. Oh, I just finished my sounds, but I got tired. Him pop… Thank you for the touch of your feelings. Yeah, I got tired. Think you heard me? You should've known that day who had the pro- поряд ק scientist love you. Xing, the game was already dark we went into jail forever. He showed me what you had. Yeah, this is just radio. Yeah, not TV. It's just radio. And nobody's going to get to be on TV. No, no one's going to be on TV. No, it's strictly radio. Okay, no, it doesn't care what happens to them. What if it were TV? I think she'd want to be on too. I mean, radio doesn't do much for her, just talk. All right. As you might imagine, not everybody in the family takes all this so lightly. Daniel's father was never too keen with us. He was quite actually bothered by the whole. He thought we maybe had a problem with the family. Really? I mean, there are, for a while that we had two daughters that only communicated through a doc. Yeah. Yeah. That period you're describing what Wendy means. I would say maybe for 10 and 12 or 9 and 11 and they would all communicate through the dust. Well, Danielle did pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley, but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duct. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention, all she had to do was rev up the duct. But, , they're having to do this one. I can't remember. She also made Danielle last that way. Right. Danielle thought, that she was very fond of us. I can't remember. Ashie. And how's the relationship between my sister and me? I don't know why. I mean, I'm each really sad, but I have so much kind of genuine affection and love for the documentary that it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings. way that it's not a busy to kind of demonstrate those feelings toward my sister because we never kind of got in habit of it. What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Bucky? Well, a really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Bucky, but I think as we've gotten on older and older we've gotten kind of more and more focused about the Bucky factor in our relationship. And the... But I think I think kind of a big talk. I mean it definitely kind of gives me this Vision into a brain that I wouldn't have otherwise Oh, I did finally snagging interview with Duckie By calling Ashley Is Duckie still up for this? Yeah, he just got back from a party though He just the best part. Yeah, he was at a happy hour thing. I'm right out with a lot of college students. I didn't call it, but he's in the down. So a lot of the friends go this happy hour on the setting. All right, it could you get him? Sure. Hey, Dockey. Yeah. How are you doing? I'm just fine. Long time no see. Back at you and work welcome to our good old read. a program. Well we actually have a number of different people. I  that's  comproves. But just  comproves. Yeah. The Dougie that I was talking to at Danielle for a radio program and Heather from on the talk about you a little bit and one of the things that she said was that when she was younger in order to discipline her if she was doing something that you didn't , you could be much control her with something called nose, squeaking. weeks. Yeah. She has this kind of a prominent note. She doesn't know I mean, she has a cut and just knows. We get, , , all the things together who are watching her mother show and this video is on and she reminded me a lot of me. Okay, no. Yeah. And comment told Miss Peggy move the clock and tell her, , I can move the and what she moved. Yes, you what? Now, if Ashley would tell her, if Ashley would step. and the catch and say to Danielle moves the poor. But with the exact same that day. ,  me, I,  how she looks at you when she doesn't approve of something I or do. She gets this half, I've called there and she gives you the side-long glance that makes you kind of feel  you're about to pass it off. Okay? Yeah. That's what she says. Is there anything about the life of her? that perhaps you could tell already on the instead but we might not know. I'm sure that  much more about it than you do. No, sorry. I'm not really in touch with a whole substance. You're not in touch with Hocenia. When I had time I used to migrate once in a while because I had some time to start up. And the time I used to be touch with her, but right now it just starts  more time, people, it's easier if you're having постain in it however. time to do time stuff things are. I just want to know my life. Duckie, stop hand puppet. Now listen to your own city. If you haven't been down to New Orleans, did you get an unspanned guess? What I mean? I all do the weakest wives of miles but all the time did night to go from miles to half. You don't have to pay to use your nation. If you were to cook all the way to a good musician. So if you haven't been down to New Orleans, you can't be The fact too, still life would check out. It was an accident that Jonathan ended up living in the chicken. He was not living the kind of lifestyle that one usually associates the chicken. This was during the period when I considered myself to be a performance artist. That's dope performance are just a few for certain. These days, Jonathan Gold's food writer this all happened 15 years ago in southern California. He was putting together performance, he added PS system which could have been represented amount of no A&P bags and high decibels. He had the two full bottles, blade American Beauty Arrow fresher, which he would spray in their entirety in the form of space. And he had a live chicken, which he bought the day before the Chinese poultry markets in Los Angeles. And come today at the show and audience gather in a dark and wear house in West daylight. I don't know if you've been to a lot of performance art but this was sort of really typical of the stuff that was torn on here. And I showed up and I was naked and I was carrying a machete and I was flying. And I stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens. the boy loads the blue by. The chicken that I bought was Tether 2A 3-foot rope. around me and I hack up and down blindly with me shedding toward the chicken or just in general. Well I was blindfolded so I didn't know who was towards the chicken or not. And I had fully intended that in fact I would kill it. But chickens aren't that stupid. And this chicken won't... no part of the machete, state of the end of a throat-feet entire time. And after 10 minutes when I've completely exhausted, I fell to a heat, and everybody laughed and performed it through his over. I don't know if you've stuck around after narcoforms, but the few minutes after narcoforms are the some of the most depressing in the world. How's up? Are you? you've done your wad, you've done your sort of bit for art, which is either worker it hasn't. But you're sitting there, you're covered with chicken flu-be in my case. It stinks the high hell. Everybody's gone and you've got to clean up and you're naked. It's really not a pretty kid. So Jonathan cleaned up. And when he was done, he had a chicken. And he didn't feel  he could kill with chicken. Destiny had brought them together. He felt  he could not turn his back. He says it was the same as if a kitten shows up in the back door scratching on the... So he took the chicken home. And in doing that, he stumbled across that hen in long. That separates food items on the one. From pets on the other. Otherwise the animals would eat. The animals we bought. So I get home and I have this chicken and I don't know what to do with it So I spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator And I put the chicken up there I Get a Can of a green giant bread niblets from under the counter and I I'll put it in a put it in a little bowl Checkered and I give the chicken a little water and the chickens on top of my refrigerator Because you think chickens eat corn you had red batters and those that was the available corn No, the available corn. I wish I had thought better of the niblets idea. Why? Because in fact, if you're buying three or four cans of niblets a day, which is what that you can aid in your existing, almost nothing which I was, then your niblet bill turns out to be  some, , two figure percentage of your total income ͡eer tine per cent? Happy Birthday, ? Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas if you put $10 ever goes for an animal. It's just hard to justify the expense  that. And the chicken stayed there and topped my refrigerator for a long time, months, six months, I think. This is  a one-room apartment. A two-room apartment. I had a kitchen and a bedroom, so I didn't have to look for the chicken when I was sleeping. Though I didn't have to look at it when I was cooking. Did you have a Coke chicken? Of course a Coke chicken. Did you feel intensely disloyal? No, I felt not particularly loyal to this chicken. I don't know if you've ever had chickens, but it's not , I mean, you don't have chickens. Chicken's not really  you to pet them and you don't hold them. There's really no love that you feel for a chicken or you don't , I don't think. But yet you kept it chicken. I kept it chicken because I couldn't bear to do anything else. It's not  I couldn't carry it out on to peekable heart and said, be... free a little chicken B free. Did you give the chicken a name? I never knew chicken. When I referred to the chicken public I was called it the hand. How did you not name it? It was a creature in your house. Chicken always seemed to have never occurred to me that I might have chicken in the chicken always seemed  something bad. I would have for just a couple of days. And then what did you think was going to happen? I guess I thought A if I don't want to check the expiry, B I have to admit that there was a possibility that someday I would actually put the check-in. I went through a lot of check-in recipes, hundreds of check-in recipes. But thinking maybe this would be the recipe for my nibbutbed check-in. I'm not sure that a recipe existed that would have lived up to the fact. of the chicken. This animal who you have come to know on fairly intimate terms and who you're raised and who will put a certain amount of emotion into. A chicken, if I might say, who has seen you naked? The chicken did see me naked, damn it. The fact is we need food to be just food. And as soon as it becomes a living thing, especially for sitting people, , when I used a chicken. version of living things into our food. It's hard to handle without thinking it has to be bigger than food. Without wanting to make it ritualized or something bigger than food. Exactly. Can I tell you a short, small story? Yeah of course. Before I go, I was in this Korean restaurant in Korea town, Los Angeles. It was this place called the Living Fish Center that I always wanted to go because the name was so splendid. I'm living fish center. I imagine some sort of vast, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very jump-in-to-beeps. And I go in there, of course, it's just  the crime-cream. I mean, it's not that clean. I don't know their tanks and stuff. They don't know what the book is. So I order a fish suit because it looks  the amph... small fish soups and it comes and it's just really strong spell and not that great. And I try squid fried with bean sauce and onions which was, it wasn't that happening. And I'm about to give up and pay the check and go home with the vast table filled with, I didn't stop. And suddenly it occurs to me with respect to the restaurant. And I weigh the weight and sopher and my tell her that I  it. a prom. And she is puzzled. She didn't expect me to ask for a prom, but I repeat my questions. And she shrugs and goes and tells the Suci Shep. And he goes to one side of the restaurant, he climbs on this chair, an ordinary golden chair, he reaches into this long cape that's running just below the ceiling. And he wiggles his fingers with a long. He wiggles fingers, the proncious. come in rage and they start nipping at his fingers and they start packing. And he picks out a couple of live-list ones and brings them back to his counter and without washing his hands, my name just makes emotions over it. And for a couple seconds later, the waitress comes over with the ponds on this huge down-byes. And what he done is you take him off the exit spell. And he essentially  the headless impact and that little part of it. the tale that is always on pause, it's still there. But the middle part is sneaking, a grub. And I picked up the promise my chopsticks, and it was not dead as a pawn. It was extremely alive. And it was wiggling its legs, and it was wiggling its antennas, and its eyes were  swirling madly on its eyes, and it was looking back at me, seeing me as actually the predator that creatures these need in. And that was a really freakish moment because as much as as much stuff as I eat and as low as I eat on the food chain and as Many ponds as I have dispatched in my life. I have never before killed a living being a team and he the pond knew what I was gonna do and he did not  it and I wasn't quite sure what to do. But if I put it down the prom, I would guide anyway. In fact, the living was out of shelves. I'm the ultimate beauty of the prom. So I did it into it. I did a body of routine. And the conscious relaxed in this way that was new to earing. And the taste of the prom, the taste of the meat of it was extraordinary. I mean, it was sweet. It was  the life person toward it was the most life thing. I've ever eaten obviously bitter. But it didn't. It was freaky. It was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption, which is killing a living creature with the teeth. And I thought that I thought that I killed it. But in fact when I put it down, it was still had someone's life in it that it grabbed a piece of salmon sushi and wouldn't let go. And I think I ever want to do that again. Do you think in some way that it's more acceptable to eat an animal if you are more awake to the fact that it isn't animal and what's happened to it? Do you think it really doesn't matter? I think it matters a great deal. I mean one of the greatest metaphors in Western civilization is... that Christ who gave his life so that others might live. And I don't want to be sacrilegious and I don't want to belittle that myth in any way, but a pick is giving you the life so that we might check it and give you the life something. And I think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken. To think about that cat that we're eating. Not necessarily to be sad. But to celebrate it, to be aware of the being that it was, that it wasn't just this bit, , bioengineered croaking somehow managed to find this way and to our place. Jonathan Gold, we'd  to perform a magazine. Coming up, a chicken diva just a few inches tall, how a chicken company changed a white man into a black man. It's in a minute from Public Radio International, way in our program to news. This is American Life, my request, which we can approve of course which is clean, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories from that team. Today's program, during this period of greatest poultry consumption in our nation, as we do every year at this time on the American Life. We bring you stories of chickens, turkeys, ducks, fowl of all kind, real and imagine. Today we bring you new stories and some favorite from poultry shows past. We've arrived at a three of our program, back three, how to do the poultry chicken. Well, let's find our show. We've heard about imaginary poultry in the life of one family, heard about poultry as pet, poultry as food. In this act, the examined poultry is a business. It is such a powerful business. It's a pretty much shunning. that it is able to recast human identities. Sometimes. Anyone older than 30 remembers Colonel Harland Sanders. He was that plantation Santa in the white suit and string tie, the ancient southern chicken hawker on the TV ads and talk show. He flashed a crinkly country smile at Mike Douglas and act all downhill, sharing a few crack of barrel crews about staying happy in old age. Colonel Sanders insisted that Fried Chicken didn't harden your arteries, and he lived been nine years old. Here's the man himself in a promo film from the 60s. So I set my ease, made the sponge, made the light red and baked off, and it was a pretty as low for bread that I made that I most ever seen. So we take my sister and a low for bread and walk this tree mouth over the end of the other cross the field, and he goes around the highways, carrying this little sister in mind, and they're taking this low for bread and he's show mom what we had done in the day. Now, two... decades after he lay in state of capital. The car was come back from the dead. He's returned to deliver a message from the other side, but it's hardly the home-spun folk was the mute expect. Hey there! This is your carnal talking! Now I got something here that's downright fun! It's more fun than what to me! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! Reanimated as a car tune, the carnal still has a pink face and white suit. But these days, the Earth's wild southern general. and twirls his cane  Puggie Bear and pimples to the greasy beat of old school's 70's fun. When he chants go kernel, he's doing the cabbage patch that annoying in zone celebration of a dance where they arm sticks straight out while the shoulders rotate. Since September 1998, in an ad campaign that began on his 108th birthday, the kernel has cabbage patched tap dance, wrapped and played basketball. He has not merely risen from the grave, he's risen above the rim where he catches and aloe out. past and jammed through rock and hole. The Colonel is now a black man. What's it mean when a redneck who dressed  a slave owner comes back from the dead and gets fucked? For people who actually knew the Colonel,  by it for John Ed Pears, his racial makeover can be a little jar. I resent it. It depicts the Colonel as a clown, as a son in dance guy. He's... about Redneck Shoman, for he believed very deeply in the early end of publicity, but he was not proud. He had a certain unique dignity to him. A little chicken music piece, that was gonna kill the weak bone for the human bone thing to them. He was a shoman though, are you saying he would never sing dem bones? No. Wouldn't do a cabbage patch dance? No. That's why I'm trying to say he wasn't... The real Hollywood Sanders was an Indiana Hick who left home young and had dozens of different careers. At one point he dressed up as the mission-man who worked with County Fairf. Finally he settled in Southeast drinking tucky and opened a gas station slash motel slash cafe. became the lab where he defected his pressure-cooked fried chicken and secret original recipe. For 30 years he ran the Sanders Cafe in Corbin, Kentucky and earned a rep as a hard-asked redneck potty mouth that really liked the lanes. What was the chamber of commerce told me that every time Harling came in and why she had to beat his hands off of her. She told him Harling get your hands off me. I got all I needed home. When he wasn't cussing in a beltrine, he was not loving his neighbor as himself. The Colonel welcomed a fight and fought to win by any means necessary. There are countless tales of him throwing knives, plates, and chunks of concrete, and lashing out and kings and chairs up past the age of seven. His supposed southern gentleman guarded his turf  a south central crib. In 1931, Ian is homey's confronted a rival who was painting over his buildbooks. Theıld juga was inaugurated on the the Kona Sides. Sanders let the bullets rip. The original recipe gangster drilled his foe in the breast and thigh. The most delicious thought about the commercials that turned Colonel Sanders into a black man is the old wooden that be so ironic possibility that his elderly subner is a racist. He did once ride in a parade to segregationist hero George Wacht. is adopted hometown of Corbin was a don't let the sun set on you kind of place known and feared among Kentucky blacks, particularly after an episode of ethnic cleansing in 1919, and positive whites lynched a few local blacks burned others and put the survivors on a train out of town. And it probably didn't help that halfway through the century, at age 60, Harland Sanders decided to become Colonel Sanders. Mimicking a southern planter who began sporting a white suit, string tied. in walkin's. A hairdresser died his go-t white to match his hair. In 1974, the Frikey Blacksploitation Click Darktown Stretters channeled the worst suspicions of Blacks and women's. The villain of the film is a Colonel Sanders clone whose fast food empire hides in underground Ku Klux-Glaven for the racist boys. The bus in the racist tone is his body. So that's actually bent over. Backward, make a change of being in the house, touch us at the end of race with real you want to overcome that. As head of public relations for Kentucky Fried Chicken in the late 70s, Ray Cowland traveled to country with the Colonel for several years. He had to kick his boss under the table sometimes to stop and grab and press about the Clawding Quality in the Kentucky Fried Chicken. And he heard a lot of salty language back at Colonel's White Tatum. He was a black man riding shotgun, very emblem of white southerners. Along the never-washtls. caught sender saying. And the only close incident that came  that was when he was writing his own loop, the preparation for whatever was going on. And he turned to me, said, well, no, what does nice books were calling ourselves these days? And I looked up and I said, well, what do you mean? Well, his term was, he said, bigger with negras. I should help. Where comes the stop, , nowadays across all the black, then even pay. I wouldn't call you nice folks black. Colonel, black with the rockatory time. And you can imagine coming to that time. That's, it's raised in that environment. We travel about with gravity. In a case with me shot with the Colonel, I always set the back and set up front with the driver. And what he would do when we got to hotel, when we stayed, he jumped out of the car, ran to the back door for me. And on the head there's a hotel and he would carry the bag. And we had at that point that back in the 1970s, the door man came to me, scratched his head. said, I know that man, Colonel Sand is that, Turkey fight chicken guy, billionaire. I said, yeah, they said, well, who the hell are you? And Colonel Sand, that's my son, but we don't talk about that. . After the Colonel died, his empire got an emissary trouble. Running around  a chicken chain with a Ted Cutoff. There was the unhealthy vibe of that bad word, pride, easily fixed by changing the name of the K. The more importantly, there was the mothing of fast food from carry out to eat in. Buckets of chicken were old-time,  families eating dinner together at home. KFC needed new crotters,  sandwiches, that people could eat in the store for lunch. And there was the matter of the dead company spokesman. Last year after many fall starts, KFC saw product and pitching crotters in one fell sweet. They viewed a line of sandwiches and other bonus items. And it brought- the Colonel back as a cartoon to sell the impact. This Peter Folk's KFC's Chief of the Mission Ed director was meat. And that's when we knew we had a hit on our hands because , literally outside of the office you'd have people doing that cabbage patch dance and going go Colonel. So we knew we had something good in our names then. Out in the street, I mean people in a store, you go into grocery store and I'd be in an aisle and I'd see a little kid doing that. to showing her mother that she can do that. So it just, , very spontaneous. Fouls denies the new animated kernel, isn't any way urban to use ad-speak flat. He confirms however, that KFC brand name is more popular among blacks than whites. We claim that the cabbage patch kernel has been embraced by black consumers. According to Fouls, the campaign has clicked so well with everybody in America that sales have risen 6% and a percent race blocker. and KFC's once sleepy lunch hours jump. Again, Ray County. I think KFC, great. I always vlogged because I did travel with the current home. It kind of reminded me of my childhood trip. And you think he would be okay with what they've done with it? I know that because I know what he's trying to accomplish. I mean, at that time I was traveling with him. He wanted to. be more involved in the minority community. I don't think at that time, failed, more than what he percent of the scale were from minority community. And he actually wanted to go learn Spanish, commercial, Spanish, and this with the minority community in New York City, in Holland, particularly. So it sounds  he was, , if it would sell some chicken, he would do it. If it sold chicken, he would do it. you You Kis, are you ready for this? We can get two pieces of chicken, leg or thigh, aside and a bit for just a dollar or nine. Where? I can't see girl. One second, Kis. Hello. Hi, it's the girl. The girl. I just want to tell you my original recipe, Chicken is finger-legged, and my square meal deal is for you. We're love it, I won't. The Colonel is free at last, thank God Almighty he's free at last, and the black man said him free. An urbanized tomb has taken the last lingering snake that he holds sound coffee. Once upon a time, in true American style, he invented himself, and now we are reinventing him. I confess, I have a crush on the new employee's fucking head. His patchwork soul is exactly what makes me get all modeling by America. I'm proud to... living country where a new little white boy from any small redneck town through hard working perseverance can someday if he's lucky go up to be a black man. Black Chinese is a righty with him book. I'm the only one who has another, hernal, highland sander, the 20th century I am near. And, at four, chicken diva. In the end it seems, when humans are concerned, chickens are what we make. For further evidence, we have this story, Jack. I'm the enough, it wasn't Susan who was obsessed with chickens. It was Kenny, a battle who worked backstage at the 90s, second street wine. in New York. His house was filled with chicken cups, chicken masks. He got the whole staff on the chickens, including Susan. For her time there in the 80s, poultry related jokes and references became the fast way to get a laugh in the wine. I guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens. But Susan for Tucci saw something else. Their potential greatness. Their hidden beauty. Their grandeur. One day she glued together some finger puppets for a 10 minute rendition of the chicken. little story for her nephew. I was 14 years ago. Today it is a full-length opera. Enjoyed by a cult following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or a small theater. It's still performed in the fingerpubbers, but now it has a complete score written by a noted composer, Henry Krieger, who did dream girls. The chicken little opera he wrote with Susan Boutucci is called Love's Fowl. Needless to say, that's F-O-W-L. Well, we were instructed. with the opening of the Seattle Delta Apsura Repetario del Amalete, we have the closed pinripetory theater and we have a special singing guest for you which Susan and I are sitting in Henry's Baby Grand piano. Henry's guest is his multi-stereo named Toby. We're having a story with you, you want to see what we can do? Okay, listen carefully because once Toby gets going, actually harmonizes. Katrina Sunezel. I'm a Victoria, I'm a little bit... Should I bring you a little bit more? Yeah, but I don't know where to am just  that. What's that? I'm sick and I'm a little bit more. Me have noticed that this libretto is an Italian, just  a real opera. Before I was just a bunch of puppets in a bar. It's now a good idea. And then suddenly, since when we're into a time, we became something bigger than what it was in the beginning. And it's because when it's in English, we all have no one in swimming up on the streets of Yelena. As soon as it's in Italian, it gives us enough distance that we can keep. , makes us, he's  the lover who doesn't want it. You don't want anybody more than you want someone who doesn't want it. That's right. and something it's sort of the same thing. In the verse of the song, I can't read it. I'm gentle, ex. I'm cute, I'm proud of you. In the same way, I'm a little more, I'm a little more, I'm a little more, I'm a little more, I'm a little more. You may recall the new last heard of love. back in kindergarten, she was just an average barn door file, but an acorn drop on her head, which she was taken last to Skyfall. Her alarms excited her friends, Goosey Lucy, Turkey Rookie, and Ducky Lucky. And they joined her for a journey to the key to telling me what news. On the way, they meet up with Sly Fox, little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner, literally has it turns out. Fortunately for little, hunger is not enough to distract her from the mission, she tracks on. which he meets the king. He tells her that the sky is not falling. It's just an ink horn. So the enlightened chicken will return to her room. That's when the story ends. What do we do take away from her? I  to think it's that little of the water with life. Precisely because she went off on this exotic mission, totally in the grip of her long night. Andyama, me, Qing, andyama, andyama, andyama, andyama, andyama, andyama, andyama, andyama. The children's favorite family figures in this story. It's just one small episode in the life of chicken level. Now known as La Pinchina People Up. After the eight corners of the earth, she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure, and almost every field of national, a diva of politics, a cedean, theater, art, daring do. Venus, she arrives from some other world. transported on a scale of cereal. But the triumphs of her life begin after youth the love affair with the fighting cock and bitter one. And she consoles herself as we all get some point in her lives by plunging in the Shakespeare. She becomes an overnight sensation as an actress, celebrated all over the world for one girl. Juliet, Goya Patra, Ophelia. The company then performs an excerpt of recreational music and perhaps volunteer in her ceremony, to celebrate her signature. Well, , I mean, Sarah Burnhart did Pamela. Well, there's a great tradition of women playing in that role in Shakespeare, but I think Richard III is one of the more rare roles to be played by a woman. Well, that's how adventure is. An actress, this chicken was. I can assure you, there's nothing  watching a fore-installed for your husband crying a horse, a horse. by Kingdom for a horse in Italian. Not to mention that that puppet is a chicken surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other AV sub-renewaries. Susan says that, artistically, there's something special about chickens. There are clean slate. There are, you can put anything on them. You can project anything on them because it's not  they have to me at least a very strong personel. Except for lock and cheetah. In the opera, she moved. to the field of archaeology, masters at Needless to say, and makes a great discovery, the last tomb of Gallopontra. But not before she sails the seven seas. She shipwrecked, it's rescued, but it's by pirates, and then she meets the pirate king. As he soon as he meets her, he calls him off. He calls her sweet spirit. She comes in and she says, here you see a little chicken, , who, although I'm dripping wet, I'm proud and yellow. Let me repeat that very for you in a pure translation. Although I stand before you, a chicken who is dripping with, I am proud. And I am young. Okay, thanks. And although I've loved and I have lost, I have learned to follow the Call of Adventures so let's sail on. Are you a fan of me? I am a fan of you. So let's go. Party. I am a fan of you. I am a fan of you. I am a fan of you. Say hello. Keep in mind all of the action,  everything that occurs in every Susan Fatucci production. Ever since the first one for her nephew, and continuing to this day, Procursum on characters created by sticking a small painted styrofoam ball onto a larger painted styrofoam ball, poking in two matte tax for eyes, gluing on a tiny felt beak. And then in pain, the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothes men that at 40s cartoon figures would clamp to his nose when the chunk of limb and the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothes and then in pain, the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothes and then in pain, in pain, in pain And I could go on. Susan has written her she puts it, translated, La Puccina Pucca was diaries, which detailed the other adventures that happened in between those in opera. There are 60 pages so far, excerpts of which have appeared in clothes lines, the official fan club newsletter in opera. Love's foul has a strange effect on people. I didn't understand it, so Susan won the ability to take the fun of others. Be honest. I thought I would be annoyed at the potential irony in hoaxies in the province. But there I was with my three-year-old daughter who loved the show, watching a plastic bird paint a line when the simplest human moments but also when the most profound. The confession of the great love, in this case, was a cock robbing. The song that she sings is she enters, those I am the chicken and then ready for love. My heart is the spread of alls, the egg from the tongue, was born. Meet me gently and celebrate you. together from Earth, but we were all reach for the bottom. And then she sings, I'm chipping, I can't fly without that. My heart, my heart is strong as the egg from the chettis bomb. And so, it is only with Kakra, the next slice. I'm more in the close of the world. I'm more in the close of the world. And after they have agreed to slung together, and they are soaring, cock-rubbing and sharp, killed, murdered by a jealous arrow. I couldn't believe it, but I was getting choked out, especially when cock-rubbing appeared stage. The star of fun brought me scraping black from the ground. It's a little magic. and the heart of their eyes called his ex-discipline. I gathered my daughter, my arms and held on tight. Those helplessly drawn into an expression of the grief, suffering in this new savor. In this era of slow, special effects, there was something unexpected to liberating in the marriage of this crude meeting. Pain of styrofoam balls bobbing up and down behind the coloured board box and the high melodramatic art that we were telling our brother. Picture. rires. Quick twist. It's  this, it's become more comfortable to un Meet him. Give him a comment.
