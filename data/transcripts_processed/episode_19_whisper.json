You didn't even use a good picture of me. You protest. So, it's CinHa Pr coexist, just in pictures. You wave a few snatch shots in the beer. Try to turn this debate into something on your own terms.

Another mixed legacy of a rich guy. aratique Saint- Cerwica Saint Arbases. At one, the gris. The last few months, the recorded name Michael Lewis has been publishing campaign diaries in the new Republic. I don't know if you've seen this enough, it's pretty great. He's also a columnist for the New York Times, a commentator on Marketplace, author of three books, including one called Liars, Parker, that is a pretty hilarious account of Wall Street in the 80s. This is the guy who's recording reads ... a novel, usually a pretty entertaining funny novel. And on the campaign trip, he has noticed 800 telling moments that no other reporter has documented. , for example, the day that Al Franken said it in that live, showed up at a packedly cannon that was picked and quite with some probe, he cannon military cadets. , for example, a packedly cannon railing against Detroit Steel Mill closing, but then, quietly, turning down the awkward inside and actually the board of directors of the mill, try to save it. And then, at some point, Michael Lewis became fascinated with some of the candidates that everyone else was ignoring. And by everyone else I should include both the reporters and the voters, okay? There were nine Republican candidates back in Iowa. And if you can name all nine of those candidates right now, I've got it. Chris Punditullah Bill right here in my hand. Call this station and know I'm not going to give you the call number. Please consider now when you consider these nine candidates what to be a better subject for an entertaining novelistic kind of writer.

And Lewis became so interested in one of these certain losers. I got a more e-tailor, but at some point Lewis's editor got completely fed up with him and ordered him never to follow around Taylor anymore. I did not send you out there to write more e-tailors byigraphy. The guy said, but it is easy to see why Lewis became so mesmerized Taylor would give away cash prizes to voters at his rallies. Taylor would burst on the stage. We're citing the words to his campaign theme song. Bruce Springsteens dancing in the dark. He would say, you need a spark to start a fire, and this guns for higher. Taylor spent $6 million his own money on the campaign. As Lewis points out, of nine Republican candidates, Taylor was the only one who had actually been a success in the real business world. Taylor began his tool and die maker, what failing companies. made them profitable and by last year his own company Titan, Higher and Wheel International. I just say that name again let's just pause on that name Titan, Higher and Wheel International. Tell it, $620 million in revenue. No debt.

After hearing him speak, 400 of the 2000 people present signed up to work on his campaign. The strange thing about Taylor is that he hasn't gotten more playing the press of the polls. He's the real plan. And he's extremely successful. business who was behaved as well as the extremely successful business means. Here, employees $5,500 at a wage rate of $12 to $7,000 dollars an hour. All of whom are included in a profit sharing market. He pays himself a modest salary and argues for something. And, often, the CEOs of publicly held corporations should never be paid more than about 20 times the wages their most needed workers. Actually, that's probably one of the reasons no one has. Asward from now. We start our day just before 8 o'clock, inside a motorhome, plastered all over with Maurice's favorite screaming ego logo. The one his campaign staffers pleaded with him to abandon. A ferocious looking bird flies out of the tea and Maurice's last name, which is painted in huge letters across the side of the colossal machine. Maurice campaign manager tried to talk him out of the expense, but Maurice insisted that the best way to start running for president was to buy six RVs. Land knots, they are called. And race them in a convoy across each of I was 99 counties and threw every new hamster hamling. Six Mom's Strosities, all jammed together and churning down the highway at 80 miles an hour, the pointer sister is flaring out of the lead vehicle, drowning out everything but more. Sorry studio! three surround the courthouse, flip on the loudspeakers, cap a few cags of beer, and everyone from miles would be talking about Mori Taylor for the next two weeks. He was right. Today,  every other day, Mori is wearing his American flag pot. He shouting over music, and the roar of the land on into a telephone at a radio talk show host. Anyone who wants to come and help, call 1-800-USA-Bare. The talk show host asks him some question. Well, replies, worry. I use the bare number because my nickname is the grids. Why do they call you the grids I ask after you can't stop? I got that when I took the company public shelves. At the closing they gave me this plot. It says, and they did it in a lot, which language I can't speak. But this is what it says. In North America, there is no known predator to the grids. So I became the grids. Then I thought about it. Up until that time, I kinda  my other, until people think it till of a hunt was of our variant, but he's not. He's the guy who ran the Roman Legion out of town.

Revolved number two. is leading into the school, which,  all the doors you will open for the rest of the day, slam violently against the wall behind me. He marches off down a long court over the rest of his time to keep up, leading a trail of startled adolescents in his way. He swaggered  a porter back on the way to a hut. Did you play sports in high school I asked Mori for a rather of the back of Mori's head? He doesn't even look around. He shaking his head I have no trouble imagining this corner in his face. Did I play sports? Yes? I am the biggest job who ever ran to Cresca. I can beat you in anything. And with that he blows through the double door as leading the auditorium. About 30 kids filed, slump down into their seats, and settle in for a snooze they'll never have. Your school is too big, foams-moorie. This is what is wrong with America. He says, pointing at the kids. Big, big, big. A place  this breathed weirdos. Students are now fully alert. I never could enjoy going to a school  this, including the kids seem to concur. How many of you ever take a counting? Yes. The kids are now squirming and ducking. He's breaking down their resistance, making them nervous. Two hands will help. Lori Shakespeare, a little sad. His tone changed. I know you got a lot of these teachers who waves nonchalopry a couple of unis and looking older than me in the ramps. And they tell you a lot of, he doesn't use the word crap, but he might as well. Thanks! But in your whole entire life, you are only going to use one or maybe two of those things. He causes and seems to reconsider. Now we all agree that the most... most important thing in your life is your family. Say, your mama and your daddy, your brothers and your sisters. But right after that, there's something else. We all know what it is. And it's green. With that, he reaches into his pocket and introduces a fat row of $100 bills. He holds it high so that everyone can see. Five grand can. The kids are now perked on the edge of their seats, giggling nervously. Yesss- It all comes down to a county. Says, A county and money. You can't live without. And the minute you make it, someone is trying to take it away. So for God's sake, find out about money. Can I have some? Ask a kid in the front row. It's mine. Shows the money. It puts the money back in this pot. A nice illustration of some general business press. Morey's positions are somewhat quick-sock.

We're going to study his brain. He's not human. He's an alien. January 13th. Tonight we flew in one of Maurice Private Plains, the Republican County Dinner at Stormlight, the Northwestern Highland. After dinner, Maurice rises to speak. He's on. Within minutes he has the crowd laughing in the clap. They agree with him about everything, especially the lunacy of the Forbes tax plan. Then, in the midst of the fun, a woman rises in challenges as pro-choice position. It's a religious issue, more he says. Not a matter for federal government. She presses, you can see she's used to making public speakers, you can come around her way of thinking, where would rat ever opening her mouths. She's picked her wrong guy today. Instead of backing down a wick, more he goes on the attack. Look, man, I think 99% of women never wanted a woman. They go through a lot of mental anguish. They suffer a lot. I say, leave it to them. She cries to speak. More interrupts. I said, leave it to the women. And there, at a banquet filled with Republican party hats, the sort of people who are meant to be rapidly co-lie. Who more expected to be rapidly co-lie. We can do such a good thing. all over the room, women were clapping so hard I thought they'd break their hands. Here I thought, it's the benefit of having someone around feels free to speak his mind. He liberates, however momentarily, those who don't. January 14th, I was waiting at the contest with the more... Why I'm CA when Mori arrived just before 9 a.m. What do you think I would show? Seriously. Rack of all games took just under 22 minutes. Mori won, 15s up, 15s gone. I'd figure that between the 25 extra pounds he's carrying the ramp in 16 years he has on me. I could have hustling. I was wrong. He knew every angle in trick on the court and played each one of the relics. Too good. After he dropped the ball and his court in the dark. As the route progressed, he shouted to his A's. 14 to zip, not bad for an old guy, shatter. And then under his breath, some of my guys are betting on you. Dipschips. As we crawl through the hole out the back of the court, he says, Don't you go right if you lost because you were nervous the President and it's going to have hard death. Commu identifies the love of winning a game, one of the prerequisites of his happiness in the modern world. And he did that without ever meeting one. More of Michael Lewis' campaign diaries and more of Cala. So, Jack, let's start here. This is the case of Pact versus California, right? Right. The fact of the case, and let me just go straight to the sort of unaffected pros of the judges. This introduced as all the characters in this central event. of kids. The age of 40, William King took his own life on our silver 30th 1991 and a lost bank of So-Tel. For about five years prior to his death, he had been living with petitioner 38-year-old Deborah Hatch. King was survived by two college-age children of his former wife, who he had divorced in the same sense. Okay, so now we have a dead guy, his girlfriend, two kids, and a former wife. But that is not all we have. Who's simson? and William Kane's life. We also have 15 vials of his sperm in the account California cryo bank. And this is where the story of this, real command money is. It is our contributing editor Jack Hitch, he reviewed his forest checks work regularly. There's not just on this program, but in New York Times magazine, Harper's S. Quire, Wungler, Franka, and too many other publications to name, but let us get back to it, specifically. Mr. Kane does not have more videos. But he did have enough, and in his will, he declared that his girlfriend would use any of the 15 vials of sperm and succeeded in getting pregnant, then the result in child would get some of the personal mentors and possibly the right to some money. This is a odd case for American jurisprudence, and the weak lip opinion includes the letter that William came wrote to his unborn, yet to be conceived child. Why? Judgment. I address this to my children because although I have only two average of teeth, it may be that devil will decide that I hope she will, to have a child by me and my dad. I've been a citrus-generating frozen sperm sample for that marriage reality. If she does, then this letter is for my precious offspring as well, but the thought that I have loved you and my dreams, even though I never got to see you all day. If you are receiving this letter, it means that I am dead. whether by my own hand, or that of another, makes very much. I feel that my time has come, and I wanted to leave you with something more than a dead and dead woman, did what's your father. I am an orderly proud to live, what I made of meat. I'm so proud of that that I would rather take my own life now, than be grounded to a mediocre existence by my enemies. Who, because of my mistakes in my father, have gained the power to finish me. How many people do we know in our lives, Jack, can say it, it's  that? Every sentence in this letter is where they've studied. I mean, I've been a, I've been a, I've been a, seriously generating frozen sperm samples for that eventuality to, if you are receiving this letter, it means that I am dead. And it goes on, I check this out. So, so he has several pages about his childhood memories and the family history. And, quote, so one. by checking up now? Basically, betrayal. Over and over again. This may be tired. I picked up some heavyweight enemies along the way, ranging from the callies of the world to crazy with guns, to insurance agencies, to the lawyers that have sucked me dry. I don't want to die as tired, perhaps defeated and bitter old man. I'd rather end it  I have lived on my time. And where I will regret. I have a... But again... But I listen to this next one. I'm just... I have lived a life that's full. But we digress. I'd rather end it  I have lived on my time. When and where I will, While my life is still an object of self-sculpture, a personal creation with rich eyes. still proud. In truth, death for me is not the opposite of life. It is a form of life's punctuation. I  him. But  what? It's  a Martin Scorsese, he's dumb. Yeah, and he's got this top guy. , here he is talking to his kid. But that's great. So why am I checking out now? Oh, by the way, just to make more interesting. So, Bob, I'm wish the lawyer for the two kids. Sand or girl, read paraphernal and else learned to find out. She is their mother and Mr. King's original wife. Wow, the luckier suing the sacred that the girlfriend is in fact the first recipient of the sacred. So, then in the footnote, you sort of discover just what the relationship is, the exchange of children, the existence of the children, and all of them. And therefore, so here, this is just a footnote, just dropped into the test. pretty much says everything. On November 12, 1992, Seedens children filed against Act a complaint for wrongful death and intentional inflection of emotional distress. Where in the illads that their father could have been unemployed for some time, came deeply harassed and began to seriously contemplate suicide about September 1. For six weeks, the court's act was aware of the scene's quote, Mr. Plan, the quote, to end the slide. that had convinced to allow her to have his child, Patus, that leave her a substantial amount of this proper, to raise and care for the instrument. In the week before his death, Patus encouraged in assistance for his proper, and she also generously helped him quote empty his personal checking account by issuing a check to hacked for $80,000, which you learn as much as you suck yourself. Pat, and then here's my favorite sentence. hacked assisted to see. and purchasing a one-way ticket to Las Vegas and took him to the airport. Okay. What do we do with that curved side conversation? Can you imagine? She bought a one-way ticket to Las Vegas knowing that he was going to go sit in a hotel, take pills. She also bought a way bought him plastic bag that he put over his head after he took the first. She gave him a copy of final next to the suicide. Hello, we can just... the plastic bag to put over his head. head when he aftertakes the pills. Isn't that the whole point of pills is that you don't have to do the ugly thing of getting a gun or plastic bags. I mean isn't that the whole point? All right, you're not up on your suicide. According to, , there come. Quite often if you take a lot of pills, a lot of people deserve it. So, , the idea is to put, yes, take the pills to make sure that. It's pretty grim. Certainly not the province of discussion. I'm learning just a lot here. The thing is they're not really concerned about the month because they kind of deal with them. Deal was, we get 80% get 20. What the word about is that if she gets pregnant. And this is where  this whole case opens up a bizarre form of law. What they're worried about is that the child would have a claim to be the state. To their 80 percent. And in fact, the child about. And that's because under his wheel, he says that if he, its pregnant has the child, then the child gets him go. Well, it's just that it's an unresolved matter. So it's likely that child is later on. for the kind of benefits that you need natural violin, job, and so on. Mr. King is a violin, Bob. He just participated in this new science, which is referred to in the case with the phrase, post-mortem in Semination. He returned to our own post-mortem. from examination when our program continues. I'll just add a little bit of volume to the left. Act two continues or discussion with journalist Jack Hitt, that a dead man in the sperm. So here's what the lawsuits about. The lawsuit is the existing kids want to destroy the sperm, all of it, 15 vials, a sigeless line of the positive method. And the courts of their complaint, the existing, say that they seek to quote. prevent the disruption of existing families by afterborn children. Afterborn children there's another there's another new  and this this case in terms of what it's doing through the English language is just groundbreaking. Forget about what it does for a while. Afterborn children. Bye. Bye. That would be 38 years old in the year one. She makes she must have this girl at once because. of advanced internal games. Right, in other words, she gets a little bit older, she's not gonna be able to have the experience. So now the court realizes that they got a big issue. What is sperm? Is it property? Is it something bigger? I mean, it exists at least symbolically on this kind of Darwinian level about preservation, species, perpetuation. One zone, genetic line. They're very nervous about just saying Switzerland. They're not really, they don't really want to be that. Let me just let me just be sure. Because if they say that sperm is proper, his white and children probably can blaze some sort of clean food or say, this is property and we have some sort of final word of this property. But if it is somehow part of his personhood, then it transcends that category of property. Right. And so they go back to the precedent and in my opinion, all the guarding unit issue. But most of the law regarding that says, , once tissue is left your body, then let's go ahead and try to get this. Right. But they point out that can't just say that about this tissue because Mr. Kane, as we know, as seriously posits these particular tissues outside of his body with the intention that he used for procreation, it's not just  sperm sitting around. With greater sperm sitting around, with greater. You understand what I'm saying? Intent to become a child. I charge you of sperm with intent. Yes, possession of sperm with intent too. Okay, so I'll swear in this case, the two kids, to plead the court that it's just weird to have a kid. Is that the word they use or is that just kind of what it comes down to? Well, no, let's just say it's it's it's see that it's just, they just, they don't know what else they say. But they just say, we all can just look at each other in the eye and we know what we mean when we say, this is just too weird. That's exactly what we said. Yeah. And  on a funny way, on that level, I completely understand. Okay. So the court reflects on this, the scar, the flex on this issue, his story, points out something you probably did not know, which is that quote, according to the Napoleonic Code from the early night in century, in child. more or 300 days after the pewpeded father's death, steam, jitterman, inkled. What that means is that the guy goes off the war, he gets killed. Well, the clock starts ticking the last day, he was in town. 300 days after that, in other words, nine months, but anybody in the child won't happen, that can't come in the father's goods. In other words, nine months after the guy's dead, this is the state closed shut. But this is where this is, the truck is in T- It's a long-assass farm sitting in the main green tent. Stayed in the green box. So in other words, what seems  a very simple though odd, family dispute actually raises quite a broad and profound question of the law. Very, absolutely. In fact, I'm , I get to this in the second. It's a little, it might be a hard stop. But it is. I mean, this thing, at first when I first read it, I thought, okay, this is just a funny case. No, no, this is actual. This is all we're going to go in the subtle column in the fun way. Now, the existing kids, they make all the screens, but there's something you just have to hear because it's just the thing. Okay. One is the, the quote, the child could suffer psychologically from being seen by the dead. Now, I need to go in the dark. the Guru Abpina, the first time all the time after one, it was probably what happened. There's now a more serious 오�owa and I can even say something with other than that, Thai love that they are already talking about that, it's not that way, it's the sameagl 돌� at that time, it's be life, that's , you have a little order and five years. this Mr. Head, the courtroom of me. this radio studio rejects that art on these grounds because your mom would tell you from the time that you old enough to understand that you did wanted to have a child with her and just for some reason it's very very busy and just couldn't get around to it in life which I have to say is one strange part of it that if you sell intent on having the baby with this half why didn't he just have a baby do we know that ... no that's not okay let me just go back to it You don't think that being conceived by that man, I don't care what the most. It's just, I mean I go, I'm sort of on just his side. It's just straight. Well no, because I could imagine very easily the mother's saying to the kid. I don't know, I think the court of this course, man. Just wants to stay for the record. This guy. I did not, he checked out by his own description. He checked out, , because of all the calories of the world and all that. I'm couldn't even hang five years to see this kid into kindergarten, okay? I mean, I don't know. I mean, to me, something about being dead before you were conceived is very weird. Okay, here's what's beautiful. What's the resolution eventually? This? This is a short, dilly dally, some hands with off to another court, but that court finally says,  what? It's property. Frozen sperm is a special class of property, and so we divide it up according to the rules 20% goes to Deborah 80% goes to the doofs. So Deborah got three of the 15 vials of sperm and obviously existing children had to do with it, received 12 vials. Deborah apparently at age 42 last year and that went into the club. I seated to the first instance in America law of post-more facility that was last fall. Now I just want to say what I'm doing here. I just want you to consider I what this could mean to because I said earlier death. was always sort of the key indicator that the state could be closed out. But now this loophole, frozen sperm, opens the door, , just keep those post more of them lost, it's going for decades. , it reminds me of my friend Peg Perry, you see, you can go to the other mannequin, and then bring some snow cows. One that was a different city, she was a seminary, seven cows. It turns out the bullsee, she was a sperm, she was a sperm, she was a bull. And, and, and, and, and. Oh, it was , certainly full made my no. Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm sure you would pay careful. I'd be , . But this boy, get out of the way. This ball died  40 years ago. And, , I guess he died in the 50s. He died  a 1956 or something. And he, he, he had spent his entire life essentially a seriously deposited sperm at the local. The local bull bank. And apparently it's really, really good spur. You really get good milk casks from this particular poll. Okay, this poll has  several thousand offspring. Probably tens of thousands of offspring, all over the country producing milk. And so as of this lawsuit, as of this case, as of this court's rule, for example, a rich man in California could now leave in the state of say a billion dollars, and many vows of sperm, seriously. positive. With the instructions at any, , fair maiden, who wish to carry one of his children to turn would receive, what's to say $500,000. A one time gift. And given his estate, he could conceivably sire. There's a 2000 children over the next century. All now potentially legal and California. See now, if this catch is on, these guys are going to stop running for the present. Exactly. I was just going to say, perro and Forbes could do something better with their time. They could assiduously, well, let's go on. So. Oh, yeah, let's just move on right past that chair. Well, we'll just, we'll just bring this to a club. This is, I did run across. I found a legal vehicle in the library yesterday. And I did find that why it came may find one other venue of existence after all. Apparently, Deborah King has been offered to hand some money by Hollywood producers I can't believe it, I can't believe it. Enoughfrage Number change is the burger hai That was tough. K formations? My coach says you really have a request to your coach. The coach says the way that he takes your rating, it......... I was just acting my plan to finish this in one of the championships at Monday morning. Last time, I asked staff number one. movie rights. Well that is the logical place for it, , and I say, I say, I say, is the proper medium for this story? I guess it is the TV movie. Do you think it's heavier than that? The proper medium for this story is trying to story check it. It's radio. And we've just done it. And thank you very much for joining us on our program. Thank you, Ira. This is Beatos Vier. When one of our producers in Nancy Updag got the notes that came with Song, she was very excited because she looked it up but apparently said it was Song 3. That was her interpretation. She looked up Song 3 in the Bible and she was astonished at how perfectly ironic. The words of Song 3 were it when put against the story of Updag. Simpson. King. The words of some three, word, how they are increased that trouble me, many are they that rise up against me. I will not be afraid of 10,000 people that have set themselves against me round about. The rise of the word, save me, oh my God. For that I have smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone, that I have broken the teeth of the ungod way. And the call is poor. I just want to say that part. I will not be afraid of 10,000 people. Oh You Four You Four You Four Unfortunately closer inspection of the notes he came with the song we built it. It's not song pretty . . . the word��ha But by then we had fallen so on over the song. We just had to play. Going over and doing jackpot and no further music. everything from there to back... janПub we where we are ain't... Alluding political campaign must at some point cease to be about winning. It's start to be about something else. The moral crusade, a chance to be on TV, a fundraiser for the next election. More e-tailors case, that's something else is fun. We now resume Michael Lewis's campaign diaries about failed Republican presidential candidate Murray Miller. We entitled this act of our program, candidate about, in a room for the kids. To blowpoint... The fact attention during the Iowa caucuses, Murray Taylor held five rallies where he gave away total of $25,000. A lot of $5,000 in each of these five rallies. And one of the winners of the five grand was the Pink Farmer named Wokey McCreaty. He just happened to be the host of the Iowa caucus for Republicans in the little town where he lived. These day ranchers are from February when the Republican kid was still full of people, we're at the same. So grab. February 8th. At last we arrived at the airport. Waiting there are several vans and cars plastered with stickers for Lamar Alexander. Lamar is going places, but as he rises he is coming under attack, not only for Mori, but from Steve Forbes, who has a new commercial explaining how Lamar turned the $1,620,000 would help a few friends. We enter the terminal. Lamar's jet is circling overhead. He's prepared. carrying the land. The Mart does everything with exclamation points. At length Alexander emerges and is surrounded by the cameras. You can see he is looking for some way to take advantage of the new camera crews. Spawning Mori, now lingering, disinterstingly on the Carmax fringe. The Mart strives over the shake hands. He offers Mori a phony smile in a line from his stump speech. Just bought my mud boots for all that negative advertising up in New Hampshire. Morey stairs at him for a few seconds,  in some kind of nutcase. That's not negative advertising he says. They're just telling you the truth. Lamar's happy face vanishes. Who? A truly nightmare sound bite is just a curse. The CBS cameras are rolling. The millionaire fighter flight instinct takes over. So what does Lamar do? He simply ends the conversation. Turns in racewalks in New York. Gotta go, he holler's over his shop. as he disappears into the back of his car. That's what happens when you meet the grids, Mori Boom's after him. But the night is still young. Thrilled by a rare authentic moment, the CBS crew newly assigned to Lamar, phones to York. New York orders the crew to leave Alexander and to fall and Mori, wherever he goes next. Mori takes the crew on a tour of Alexander's jet, which looms massively. besides more his own small plane. Tell me what is wrong with this picture, I hear him saying. Here you got a little plane, made right here in America, along into a guy who just made his own mic. And over here, you got a $25 million dollar falconer, made in Canada, being used by a politician. Four or five Carlos of Alexandria's gaze on, helplessly. Meanwhile, overhead, fuck safire, fuck! Dole's jet is now circling. Unwisely, it decides to land. There are a tarmac in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, one-third of the republican field is now a symbol. Even more astonishing, the one national news network on hand is trailing around behind the sureest loser. Dole's plane rolls and exorably towards Mori and CBS, oblivious to the danger. And here, says Mori, we have another politician. any real money? No. So what's he flying in? A $19 million challenger. This one is made in France. But then, just as it appears that Mori will have one last chance, asked Joel about his $4 million government pension. The frontrunner spots Mori, die straight into his car and beats Alexander VF-word action. February 10! On Querotechn profesional sounds Church in Demoen, his celebrate heterosexual marriages and protest homosexual ones. Together with a crowd of maybe 800 people, Alan Keys, Bill Graham and Papu Cannon have all turned up to take their wax. All the rest except Mori have agreed to sign some pledge to make homosexuals as miserable as possible. Who gives a shhh, Mori said, when I asked him why he wasn't going, if he wanted to be hoody so bad. February 12th, when I phone Wilford McCree the winner of Maurice 5000 dollar drawing to ask if I could observe the caucus on his farm, I could barely hear his response over the squealing of pigs. Upon my dropping of Maurice's name he said, at Maurice Taylor he has it exactly right. I was in. The McCree did have been farming the same land in the middle of nowhere for 128 years. They have both traveled some. Let's been 10 years. since the McCreebe's last attitude engaged. In their farm hours making best-in-fankings seem  a walk in the park. Unlike their neighbors, you're just about everyone else and I want them to accretisly not participate in any federal farm programs. Before long, the pot drips to politics. On the phone, the Creebe became a bit worked up about the marriage rally at the church in the morning. Those games and Lesbians have got a protest that meeting. He said an amount of utter disbelief. God damn makes me angry. He said he would have driven the two of the half hours to them one. Throw his support behind the strikes, but his south were piqued. Now once again, he says how angry the gaze made, but in the flesh his anger comes across different ones. At some level he may be angry, but his prejudice seems mainly to give him pleasure. As he lays in the Clinton, homosexuals, and the US government, his real emotions more  the light. The delight of a good fan looting for his team. Go, straights. Is it true that Forbes owns a maple fork photograph? Yes. I say it is. That gumman! He says, Oh, well for what is that man? Asked Mrs. McCreeady. That man took pornographic photographs a homosexence, telling Mr. McCreeady, at which point Mrs. McCreeady just rolls her eyes. I tried to make myself as a gree able as possible, but it's only a matter of time. have to come clean with my left-winging associations. The tension builds as Mr. McCredis stakes out a political position on the other end of the spectrum from mine. But it's nearly two hours before I discover that the MacCredis have no idea where I am from or what I do. Only that I am a friend of Mori Careers. You're not from Peta, are you? Ask Mrs. McCredis finally. I have no idea which he's talking about. People for the ethical treatment to the Maybephal shape explains. There's never no one going to interrupt. Lately they'd gone to our schools dressed up as carrots to tell the kids not to eat meat. It's truly astonishing. As far as these people knew, I was some protest that would come to disrupt their lives, and yet they still fed me and humorously before venturing to ask. One of the few things I recall from college is that in the Homeric universe the mark of a civilized person is his kindness to strangers. The good king feeds the dishes first. asked questions later.
