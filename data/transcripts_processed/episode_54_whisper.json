This is American light and I recognize. What are you staring at? Brora's ears? I dig a broad with no procedures. This is recording for 1952. and the same day was coming in a club, and such a puzzle. And  everything else about Frank Sinatra, what's fascinating about this republic is how many different people he's able to be all at once. Putting up on the one hand, and then turning around and seeing his horrible, possible love songs on the wall. When you're... Who cares for starred skies? Where is it hurt baby? Where are you? That's me, and it's later. He's lashing me into a gossip house. It's a dirty joke. I never met him. I met many, many males, thanks. But I never met a female, think. Until I met Garth, he killed Garma. How's that for an over-up? I went mad if she was a good-looking thing. That's such beautiful music for the merchants and such good-gabels. It's one of my scariest things. The Washington Star. The town where she came from, they had a beauty contest when she was 17 years old. And nobody won. There was a pool in Los Angeles, kid the boy was standing there. And she was nobody else to give him the cup because she was going to look at her friends. line. Then this is where he is on stage for Sammy Dave's tune. In 1962, we were still grounded for a mainstream white former to be integrating tonight for back-to-all. But a good question of the act is just, Snatcher and Martin, telling Davis get off the stage. And Davis feeding with him to stay. Yeah, guys I think we'll do good. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, thanks, Reddy. Oh, sing with you. Oh, swim with you. Oh, cut the lawn with you. Oh, go to bar. Missed this with you, but don't touch me. Third and century after this was quoted, what is the most striking that is, how many of the jokes are simply about and back that a black man is on stage these white guys. I'm going to play you out of big chart. I mean, well, I'm not a giraffe. Area five of these, much will leave. Hey, how come he got a white stool? I think what ladies tell me I offer some impersonations for you nice of Sam that's a good idea What you do more review get on your horse and get the hell out of you I tell you what Two James Murders on this set Let his Jedi Cause Lifeiller's question that was this quartz in fun Well Have fun! It's low blue Unless she loves you And if you  him you're gonna be cookable about things He's just your excuse, precious and carbon-compet What's in my day was finally a sin to do that was not sure. It is , I do it between a black man and a white man that is, it's on a magic. To here, you can't imagine the thing performed today by a black man. It's only performed for years. Here in my shadow. I mean, I don't think that's a sin. We're closer than mine. I'm just shadowing with a woman. In Frank Sinatra, we see the history of the 20th century. In Frank Sinatra is a shaggered writer named Rene Sparks, but it's it. We're not just here, ma'am. We see it. Frank Sinatra is my father and my brother, and goes boy from my left. I was the floors employee of the closet. floppy go-time. These are thoughts, especially with this grow-wall and the shift from back to much start. These are the real good men, falling off the stool in my head. Surely the place is the letter stick of gum behind the mirror can take something running. But he also  to go to an ice cube from the screen. Trusting in the palm of the body, our fans, smiling. Here, go scare around them. I wish something to hurt you to a train, so I can kill you for you. She gets hot too, she's gonna be dead, wait that fucking night. She's gonna be a daughter, but there's no other way. She's never bothered with someone she takes. There's no other way, there's no other way. Well, today on our problem, of course, Chairman of the Board, at one of our program, we did. at the Frank Sinatra, Michael Ventura read some of his novel of the same name. Act 2, a modest request to all of American television from one Sinatra fan on 10 years. Act 3 is great lesson. For the young people, Act 4, Frank Sinatra has called, you have A to Lies on the program. Reading from his classic 1966 account, several weeks he spent following Frank Sinatra at the height Sinatra, Red Pack Power. Act 5. I rest on full practice, get to try. Let's save it as well. That's why I'm a baby, that's why I'm a baby, that's why I'm a baby, that's why I'm a baby. Pack on. The death ONE enough. I'm gonna enjoy it if you ask me audio figuring out what happens. I'm almost chirping... And if you show up as a Seek, in the Philippines in New York,  some octopus park, fam. He was the most famous Italian, some baseball stones. Literally, he just figured he could ask about songs. He was held up to me by my father as an example. See him and spit anybody's eye. Well, I can make sure I publish the novel in 1996 called The Death of Frank Sinatra. Sinatra's people were not pleased. The book, however, is not literally about Sanskrit. It's about men  Michael and Shura. He's sense of style and sense of self, came in part, some Frank's stuff. What's it mean for you to death in Frank's? The death of the style. The death of the world. Last and greatest. In body. Oh. A kind of shit. street elegance, a style that is particularly indelibly funny and sensitive in the innocent. Frank Sinatra himself only opposed him to the ones in the scene that he's in there. He's going to be a concert. One of the things that's interesting is that in a work of pitch-in,  Michael Ben Schroer to choose any error. Sinatra constitutes put in. He decided to choose Sinatra in the mid 1990. The reason why he says this because the Sinatra that exists for today is the Sinatra of all of the Church of our control. We are going to contribute as a counter what Sinatra is as he handed into this one concept. As the Old Man walked out on the stage, the curtain came behind in the rear of our door machine. Every musician worked at the ceiling, conducted the small round and sitting grandly. So the Slash of the conduct is hand-rhythmed. brass persons were about a tempo number and it's not that flash or smile that made them work on a can. The young smile in their patients and his eyes were the same as they'd always bright or in person and they ever register on the school. And by the smile the eyes were young and they've seen the emotion. For them, they'll make up with serious sad rabbit and say to face the eyes and the smile in their country. Without a spotless This isn't just for fun, So, not regret the microphone from the top of the background. And saying about how they made him feel so deep, he's strange within this room and how they've made him feel so young and feel that what he means, all right. Song itself. It was as though Sinatra's voice was living his entire life on a different stage throughout the song. First bars were the old man, Rast, War, unable to hold notes while. and only his mastery of rhythm kept the song right and made him choose a surprise. Surprising though everyone in the room knew the way it's my life. Then on my high note the voice cracked and for an instant music sound and the audience splinched the floor in person but instead of retreating from that band sound it's not for a room dancing it's not for bent and note further into a jazz life on and so here the rest is the stake from memory by making part of the tunes. And then instead of softening it, it's enough for a healthy, no longer an hour, so diving means. Then took a quick breath and sang the next note louder still and further, until seamlessly several bars in the voice of 30 and 40 years. 4. Nothing. Resonance. And so again, it became a cry. And again, use the cracking, margey-late backing to the voice and style of the old man. One pitch, but raw, one note could be. Sometimes write on the beat. sometimes just off, keeping the performance tense until on the last note the young man's voice return as those saluting the old man who sang it, and it's not to let that no cry in the audience cheer. It was a breath of silence,  watching the trapeze on his throat and that me. With barely a pause he started to sing at how the best this yet to come and wouldn't be fun. And old man some ages space and could make them believe the length of the song the best And the voice again going to and fro between strength and prejudice, youth and age. So not for his foot tap the beat with absolute circumstances, while his posture was ever so slightly wobbling, as though his energy was too much for his body. And in his immaculate proxeter with the surety of his presence and reckless competence of his style, he seemed to be demonstrating his legend without training on, without needing. The lyrics would try obvious sentimental. Somehow he made them to. The music was simple to the point of childishness, somehow he made a complaint. They found themselves according and cheering at the songs and not in homage, but as the only way to reduce the Indian theater. The man was dispensers, kind of parrot, searched from his darkest bright light, and he was getting it away with generous abandoning, so he had no fear, and did not promote it, and he saw it, and he shook, and he said, such an old man, where could this life happen? I read my sin, yes. What kind of person? I stayed. I tried to stand between the state, I tried to walk between the state. I was in, but because I was imitate, all the people who gave me property life, took so many of their cues, where it he taken his sins. From peasants who came to America from an older, less sentimental one, peasants who came to America. the intention of becoming a republic and who almost the sum of their lives began to stand and walk out those distant friends, they'd walk so closely, get from a fog, generation. European princes had taken grace, American streets, common fair, they didn't need to learn violence. That's very good. It's an utter blend of all this better than any, and sang, to be said. Sang of love and pride, despairing of one, reddling in it. This is why she is seeking the special aid in respect in the peculiar ways of seeing these effects, meaning homage, deference, consideration, and that invitation to betray the Lord. Now some after saying about how they, wherever they couldn't take that, but in that one, waiting. But somehow in the way she held her half in the way she sifted her tea, as beyond the world's possibility to destroy or even. There was a scrapbook of Sennakus which is the picture's role of Sennakus but he was never around. Sennakus was linked in Johnson with Ablaist and with Elano Roosevelt and his older hand working for Ireland. With Jack Kennedy, Bob, Jack, Nixon, Ray, Nancy and Sennakus were very different. Sennakus with Johnny Roussette, Paul Castellan, Carragambine, Carros Sun Joe, Jimmy Philadelphia history. Still another time, so not to with Marilyn Monroe, Warren McCall, hungry bokeh, while when brand grew his songs, he hopes to press begin. That man on the stage at Olden, swear at all. Who else helped in a veteran of Ruzbe, and shaking hand, Karla Ganbeen, or both, , that man on the stage at Olden? Why? Because he could sing love songs  no means. Is it? Is it? chance fixed by loves him. That's right, that's the all people say. Some people get their kicks from stopping on and dreaming that he don't let that go. And now he's singing that we're much too long this forward. The man was speaking, I'm just waiting for a downbeat, not a bus. Are you working them on? In musicians' land. The conductor that little round man. That's my son, guy with the earphones. At the promise is not or I get the bummer job. More of that. Something wrong is the music is playing, it's not the work of singing. He was looking around as though he's gotten here, he started a little bit, then stopped, he didn't pick me. He looked frightened, scared, bored, and body of an old man. He turned toward his son, whose presence seemed to remind him that he was working, he was practicing up, and was very similar to his son's position. And he wheeled around and began to beg for the props. luck be a lady, and that she keep her party for me, and that she not dwell on someone. But it had been an awful moment to see that confidence suddenly abandoned, with nothing in the man's face. He sang more slowly now, that it seemed we've stood and talked  this before and he was running, that we looked at each other in the same way then there was no way to remember at home. He sang in the young boys in the old, back and forth, wearing when and no other. And as the lyrics climbed to the final high note, he became his voice younger and younger. Until he hit the last wind round and forward and held that note a long time. And when note and the word for finally exhausted, the boost muscles of his fatty face trembled, as though they'd been on account with the left behind and his eyes were frightened. He had to know, it was very fast. This was the last time in force and blinds to something  that. He would play an old man, he would set. Take a few steps, try to overcome. Swallow, the studies. I'm what they call the Sylvain's. For most of the performance you've been singing happening about, Drunken, perhaps that was in part function range. It was easier that that ravaged and understandable voice to sing fast the tempo for gave him the flexibility to go through many changes in the use menu approach. Slow, sad song. required rounder tones, more control, could not be played with these, the far more dangerous. Fristening the relation, hmm, say which you . That's a very brave man. So on again, telling us the drinker, all we happen to be, and we hear what's very happy but we're in the greyhack. He says he's paying for the drinks and the last of paying for everything, because the woman would aim to ask, no, and she really, what attendance and answer, and he's answering. what a terrible, generous, all-in-compsing. He's not there. He's not angry. Those angels lie at every right you live in. He asks us to excuse me. Because he needs this. His voice is disappearing. A scratchy whisper. No wax, written in the shan. With unbearable colliding, with tenderness close to death, the death of his voice. He is saying, I must excuse me. I must forgive. So no angel. But he could not live in the same place, but each time he sings there's him. Let's us watch the dying relation between demons, boys, demons, men, him and that and there in the death of the Greeks. And before Men cause no reason when they are充 within the birds approaching them. And after Hell, just before being born where reason remains alive. After Hell, Death will be afund. He can't even say it's he. He touched what we  to think was our history and it is left in our place. Everyone shoot and walk up the stairs. They know what they're doing. They know they're watching men. Quick one in every performance. You've seen that the song is for, it's called the Saloon song. I do want to need performance because somebody somewhere is somewhere in the suburb sink so I don't want to disappoint him. He has to have a lot of truth back to that food. I don't know if I started working in joints, or in jersey, bars, or drills, or kinds of places. If one day somebody came in and I'll see a better job. Look what happened to me. Nothing. Drink up, drink up all you people. Or anything that you've seen. And you have fun all you lovely people. Drink up, drink up all you people. Actual. Once an entrepreneur pan, this is all of Network TV. Our program today was first broadcast of the year's back in Christ's Natural Story Live. In an original broadcast where a serival made a plea for American television newscasters and a prediction that what would happen when it's not finally died. Here's what she said. I'll tell you at the end of this story. Any day now, Peter Jennings will put away from some freak mudslides story, casualties, six registered voters, face another camera and announce Oak Rewise Death. Later the world news tonight credits will roll over a tasteful montage of Frank's film stills and album covers. The other networks will run similar tribute, as well the brain he acts at entertainment tonight, and those swimmers on the news hour at PBS. But it will not matter whether Sinatra's video weight is hosted by the Tsuhiji Jim Lair or the Purketei Purketei Purketei. Because each and every member it will be accompanied by the same damn song. The most obvious unsuttle, disconcerting will dictatorial chestnut in the Old Man fast and dazzling backlog. My way. When the guy who generously gave us greats  I get a kick out of you, kicks it. We won't put on our basey boots or get a lot of those kuku things he's been saying. We'll be bored terrifically screening at the TV set every time he and that sathi screen section face the final curtain And the law and the spirit saw I face the final curtain Get it? He's dead and on tape from the grave talking about how the end is near. Spooky. I believe. Oh life. The only way my way has ever worked is if the person singing it is younger than the song, which is why the only successful rendition of it was perpetrated by said vicious. Frank, an Elvis for that matter, was always too complicated, too full of rhythmic freedom to settle into the song's simplistic selfishness. My way pretends to speak up for self possession and personal vision when really it only calls for September 10th. comes into two year olds, or perhaps the last words spoken to Eva Farron. Remember the stories from Belgrade, how each night in the government controlled evening news in her to townspeople blew whistles, or bang on pot. so they wouldn't care the state's lives. Keep that beautiful action in mind when Sinatra's dead and all the TVs in your more boring democratic world are playing my way. Ground it out. Play something else to the mind posh in your own heart. Or just turn off the TV sound. Have your stereo cut up and ready to go. You could kill over in second. I mean, who might not even make it through this hour-long radio show? Be prepared. Why not play angelized script, subtle reference? to the singer's Mediterranean windows to the soul, for it's knowing Johnkey at you. Excuse me! Why are you listening Peter Jennings? Here are great those work. And you're all those. post-war black and white snapshots. How that nice Christian park-out troquensit brings unlikely salvation. Let's all listen again. Excuse me! Wildlife. This is a... I admit this may not be quite stupid and obvious enough for network television. So if the staff of the today show is hearing my voice right now, here's another subject. That's life! That's life! That's what all the people say! You're riding high and April, shut down and may! If angelize is all periods and costs... This song is all exclamation points. Picture please good morning America staffers. Quick cut shots of Sinatra with Eva Gardner. Sinatra with daughter Nancy and age 5. Sinatra with Kennedy. Sinatra with some mob boss no one will recognize anyway over these lyrics. Sinatra with a pop up pirate with a pop up horn and a king. I've been up and down and over and out and I know one. It's really a terrible choice. Just as corny as my way, but at least it's got a little bit of the old ring and ding ding. It's sweet. This is my A-VM Liveboat. Anything. but my way. As for me, when I hear the big news, I'm tempted to think I'll be cranking up my favorites to not decide, come dance with me, but it's too disrespectful, cheerful to work as a judge, and kind of creepy if taken literal. Who accept Tom Petty wants to boss caught with the courts? I've decided instead to Blair the capital recording of poll orders what is this thing called love. It's a driving question behind the entire Sinatra Reef. search project, and it's a lovely pop song, suitably melancholy for morning, reflective, and wise . The orchestra starts off low. Enter a clarinet that somehow looted and pondress at the same time, Frank Scrawl's the topic sentence then repeats it adding one word, this funny thing, called love. It begins as a rhetorical question and by the end turns into a cosmic inquiry of God. What is... This thing... This funny thing... Campus It's mystery. Why should it make the fool of me? Now, ET producers are paying attention at the end of the song. ask one more time to the Lord and heaven above. This is what is this thing called love. And then he cuts out as if he's off the face of the theater in person. Just what is this? And then, once he's gone, the orchestra resolves to a sweet final court as if they have the answer, but Frank Sinatra is no longer around to hear it. Can't you just see the free spring, Frank, in the recording studio for Capitol to the pilots and TV producers of America. I beg you for all of us for free. It's Neon the My Way. Excuse me now. Well, I just hear. Well, I'll go Sarah Bals lead you! of grotesque, twice on our show, and once when it appears all things considered, we're thanks to not the guide, we made 14, 1998, to month after we last played Sarah's commentary, every network newscast used to song my way in the signature. So much, 30-hour public live net 2, all-Jardton's initial date. The one exception was ABC's Nightline, which is often the most forced into the news. The next Dark York dog. Netlines and it's special hour long trip to Sandra, a plane says, good news for it. In other words, personally, got the last word. On American Network news that day, they have snuck this past, Sarah. For essay, it's not quite good. The book of radio essays, take a can. Coming up, gay police on the road with snuck it, 66, that's a minute, public radio with national, one up, Obstrous is midnight and that theaterilly is the end. This American life on my request and truth is... The greatest theme of variety of writers, poems, wack that fiction, non-fiction, radio monologues, whatever we can think of, and substitute the show. What? What was his name again? My name is Francis Alper. This is Alper. This is Max. And I sing love songs. Mostly after dark, mostly in the saloon . Yes, you cannot have a career as long in distinguishes Frank Sinatra's without some experiments that fail. Witness Frank Sinatra's cover of air dead we go to Brown or the Rodden's doing poetry he reported. I can just about catch the day. Tonight makes me miss. Nothing, reason. So maybe that it catches on a way and follows you. Where one follows, and she runs and leads. What is that? The night makes Frank Sinatra and Irvis? Frank Sinatra? John Conner's, you provides a lot of music for our video for that. There's a huge, huge, Frank Sinatra culture. zas always the navy vehicles does. this other movies are a yeah the to age . is for is for and none of this is for it. It's really weird. And it's really weird because these are the songs that made me  it. I'm just thinking of this now. Here's  when I'm growing up, I get in your beetles. I heard the chipmunks do. , I'm a post baby, but my mother, but my mother. was going out and was by Synopherson and this dropped so this is the song This is Mrs. Robinson when I hear it the Simon and Garth vocal version of this song It's the new version. It's the cover. This is the original the Simon and Garth vocal version accurate. So let me explain to you a little bit. In time of this big breakthrough is a solar cylinder, in 1972, prismatr is simply more emotional with stress, more vulnerable, more open-needed sensual, than any male possible to that human. But the prismatr that we think of as prismatr did not appear into the 1950s. After a career song, after his second marriage, he went into the studio to record songs with a much more atmosphere. sound to be done before. This public image is becoming the character who we know now. Half-puck guy, awesome menoswinson. And Nelson Riddle and headed the sound to his albums with heavy input and with some other 50s of the era of nearly everything we think of today's small story. Those fingers in my name, that's why come here this day, that strips my content back. It's witchcraft. This great-a-well-feed-out says that the sound of the riddle invented the snap, stored around. It's thunder, wood, little trumpet, and trumpet. And there's this light-use verse. There's a much more complicated means, all of you. And counter-mellabies, misnits, than other poses, using them. On top of that. Witness for example, how riddle used trumpet or Harry suit sets. Essentially he was not hired as a trumpeter, except the section of the side, strictly as a soloist or an obliotist. And he would not have the section that he would sit beside and go special microphone. And so, sweet, so just improvise these little trump fills here now, muted trumpet. And when he plays it, he's only playing almost intimately grass. Well, if Gary gets points out, sweet, essentially plays three kinds of solo. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep, beep. He comes in here if I understand right right after us and I just think people should take I Never comes late She never bother with evo she ate That's why the lady is He's gonna come back again a couple seconds She'll have no To rest the world in His garden�orping.... Gleb A H He bulb H H Ha Na That's all. Go. If you want to glance, you need to provide fits not to their dreams. One of my same steps is by journalists gateways, first published in the Nessparer Max. It's a set of cuts not to play. It's a song for these sets with minimums. I'll be in a context, let's get this to you. Frank Sinatra, holding a glass Buddha in one hand and cigarette in the other. Sitting a dark corner of a body can you see it? effect, fading bombs, reset waiting from the sea. Please do not. Here the ensignance, during much of the evening, except now on this private club in Beverly Hills, has seemed even more distant. Steering out through the smoke in the semi-darkness into a large room beyond bar, where dozens of young couples and puddle around small tables, were twisting the center of floor to the climbers flying the floor-clunking of the city. The two blinds knew as it's not just four male friends studying a bi. That was a bad idea at the force conversation on when he was in his mood of soul and silence. A mode that had hardly been uncommon during his first week at November, a month before his 50th birthday. So, not good that working in the film that he now disliked, he could not wait to finish. He was tired of all the publicity attached to his dating 20-year-old Mia Fowl who was non-site. He was angry that a CBS television document that he was , shown in two weeks, was reportedly proud to be placed, especially as far. of the soul-fetched masterpieces . He was worried about the starring role in an all-along envisition and piety, Sinatra, Nam in this music, which would require that he sing eight key songs for the voice that at this particular moment, just a few nights before the taping was to begin, was weak, sore and uncertain. Sinatra was ill. He was a victim of ailment so common, most people would consider it trivial, but when it gets to Sinatra, in plungiment of state banks. You can press, hack, even rage. Frank Sinatra had a cold. Sinatra would have cold as we pass it without any Ferrari that I feel on course. For the common cold, rough Sinatra had an unshrilbed dual choice. Cutting into the core of his pockets, and it affects not only his own sight, but also seems to have a psychosinatic base of the... and does its work for him. Bring. And on him for their own wealth and stability. They sonn't with a cold, can, in a small way, send vibrations to the entertainment industry and beyond, as surely as President of the United States suddenly sit and shake the national economy. For Frank Sinn't who's now involved with many things involved again, Zonesome company is director of private airlines, and this is parts of Earth's wheel of state hold for growth and nation. his personal staff, seven-five, which are only a portion of the power he is and has come to represent. In our scene to be also the embodiment of the fully emancipated male, perhaps the only one in the mirror, the man who can do anything he wants, anything and do it because he has the money, the energy, no apparent guilt. All the way. all or nothing at all. This is the so-called Pupermitus friends that they wish to remain that none of the easy Anglo-Size and outs . But if the remain loyal then there is nothing so not will not do for them. Fadious gifts, personal kindnesses, encouragement when they're down, adulation when they're up. They are wise to remember however one thing is they are not the boss, little part-room. For better still, he is what, traditionally, if long and called, warmly whispered on, men of respect. Men who are on both majestic are men who are loved by all and are very generous by nature. Men whose hands are kissed of the walk and village to village, men who are personally glad to be ready to address it long. Franks are not those things personally. At Christmas time, who will personally, does the press to squish close friends and family. Remembering theats... jewelry, they are favorite colors, size, they are shirts, dresses. The same synoptic can, within the same hours, bloat in the power-ingrages and tolerances, small things can be corrected on freedom, but once piezoms. For example, when one of his men brought him a framer, patched one, which synoptic pairs of cores, the anguish through the bottle of milk, splatter him patched all over. And Las Vegas, after the last show with the sands, is an octocrowd which numbered that's fine. All got into a line of cars and headed for another club. They were clear-cut, the night was young. They stopped at the Sahara, taking long-table note of that. And listen to a ball-head-a-little-commuting men down-rickles, which probably more cost-recognitive than a little comedy. His younger soul ruled in such that taste that it depends not. one because it's too offensive to the offensive. Spouting at E. Fisher among the audience, Ripple's proceeded to ridicule him as a lover, saying it was no wonder that he could not handle his fatailer. And when two businessmen and the audience acknowledge that they were Egyptians, Ripple's cut into them in their country's policy to his real. And he strongly suggested that the woman's seated at one table with her husband is actually a puppet. When is it not.... Dr. Pradwakum, Don Rickles, could not be more delighted. Pointing to Snaps, Pau, Julie Witzel, Rickles yelled, How's it feel to be Frank's tractor? Yeah, yeah, Julie keeps walking front of Frank's clearing the way. Then not into Leo the Rosha or former baseball player Rickles said. Stand up Leo, show Frank how you slide. Then he focused on Snaps, and I feel I'm to mention the affair. No that he was wearing a two-pay. No to say that Snaps was washed up as a sim. And what's the nodril? laugh everyone. Rickles pointed toward Joey Bishop and said, Bishop keeps checking with Frank. See what's funny. Then after Rickles told some Jewish jokes, Dean Martin stood up and he said, hey, you're always talking about the Jews, never about the Italians and Rickles cut him off. What do we need the Italians for? All they do is keep the flies over. Sound to laugh, they all laugh. Rickles went on this way from early in that on to sound to standing up. said, all right, all right, come on, get this thing over with, I got it go. Shout-up and sit down, Riggles Yel. I had a listen to you sing. Pretty naked talk of Ducino, Ducino. The kings Riggles Riggles Riggles Yel. It's not the left yet. Then do more important part of the whiskey over his head. entirely brinches his type of seat of pound at the table. By 4m, Frank Sinatra led the group out of his house. Some of them carrying the glasses of whiskey with him, sipping it along the sidewalk. into the cars, and then returning to the sands they walked into the game scene. It was still packed with people. Frank Sinatra holding a shot glass of bourbon in his left hand walked with a crowd. He and life-sumptuous friends was perfectly pressed, as to see the tide precisely wanted to shoes on the smudge. He never seems to lose his dignity, never let his guard down, no matter how much he has brought, or how long he has been up. Never sweys when he walks  Dean One. No, it doesn't dance in the up. also jump up on the table with life-salt tables. A part of Sinatra, no matter where he is, is never there. There's always a part of him, sometimes a small part, that remains little by draw. The crown that it gathered around him now opened to let him prove. But a woman stopped in front of her hands. He sighed, and then he said, thank you. In the rear of the sand's Lord, guiding him with a long cable reserve persona. MI boca, room was fairly empty at the south, which perhaps he does not have people in the room, including a table of four on escorting young ladies sitting near Sinak. On the other side of the room, a long table sat seven men shouldered against the wall, two of them wearing guard glasses, all of them peeing quietly, speaking hardly a word, just sitting and eating in this enough. The Sinak party, after getting settled and having a few more drinks, ordered something to eat. Table was perhaps the same. The one reserved for Sinatra whenever he's a Jilly's in New York. And the people seated around this table in Las Vegas were mainly the same people who are often seen with Sinatra Jilly's restaurant in New York, or at a restaurant in California, or in Italy, or in New Jersey, wherever Sinatra happens to be. Once Sinatra sits to die, his trust in friends are close. And no matter where he is, you're not elegant. place may be. There's something that the neighbor can show him because, so, after no matter how far he has come, is still something of the boy from the neighborhood. Only now, he can take his neighborhood with. In some ways, the quasi-family affair, a preserved table in the public place, is the closest thing that's not in the house at all. however there's a person who might not look into everything over the州 that's I thought, Hassanatra affects us. Leave this account. Every day , can you enjoy your... Recently a room full of people were almost killed by Frank Sinatra. I was there. I know. The scene was a Turkish command house, in Lower Manhattan. This is my neighborhood hanging out. Surrounded place where only the employees... committed to smoke. I go there because so do a lot of others. Muslim cavities on their breaks, fashion students from Kyoto, elegant immigrants from Tehran. So there we all were the other day. Eating grilled lamb and deep fried balls, chickpeas, off-starred from plates, flath, forks and hives. When suddenly we heard a new song. Tell them to show them. Now many of you have already seen. seen televisions in most of us have too. But the surprise of it in my local kavabari is that thus far we've only heard Turkish radio. So we all do respect we turn to look at it. As tradition tells you to do, whenever anyone switches on a television in your presence. There was a black and white movie. There was a man switching on a train. There was a woman wearing pearls and a great deal of mess. scare a hairspray and lipstick. There was Janet Lee and there was Frank Sinatra. There are moments in a crowd when American makes so much sense when you want to scream, bring me your tired, your poor, your hungry and let's all deed Frank Sinatra. I mean to say this is one such moment. So all of this is felt silent. As again, custom holds is the courteous thing to do when a television plays in the public setting. And through the steam of onions browning and olive oil, we watch the Menturium candidate. Now I've always wondered why you can never go into a place and hear my favorite Sinatra albums. His sad albums,  no one cares, are in the Wii Smaller Hollywood. And instead you only hear songs , mean work, work. Well, there's a reason. And it's the same reason restaurants have to be careful when these movies are RTV. It's a possible health code violation to be died from snatching. In the movie, Sanatra is coming apart. He sets a cigarette between the lips and it falls into his snatching water. It's around and best. Only Janet Lee is watching. Try to light a map. match, drops it, manages to light one, but his hands shake too badly and magical goes out. He asked Janet Lee whether she might be smokes, and her eyes meet and he followed him along. She tells him she doesn't mind it all. He's too. He tries to light one up in here. Looks  he's going to vomit, burst out of his chair, knocks over the string. They're in the Turkish- She got house, our mouths were full of Baba Ganesh and hummus, and baby land. But all of us have stopped to chew. We were too struck by what we were seeing. A man, we all recognized, was on the television. That's great, damn. Sinatra has tried to flee the woman, but she follows him. She asks him where his homes. Can't look at me. His voice catches on every syllable. He tells her, he's in the army. His eye makes flutter. He sets on the cigarette, she's lit. He sighs. Apparently, whatever he is. We all know people who hate fancy nature for all sorts of reasons. Mostly for how the treats other human beings, in so-called real life. And they dismiss the undeniable beauty of his power. Under these people have been in terms of God's house with us, what they would think seemed as seen. As with the best albums, Sinatra doesn't seem to be going for many scripts. There aren't printed up lyrics in dialogue with this kind of thing. It's the real style. In this scene, he says almost nothing. He excels, and sweats. He's a woman. He's a woman. standing before us, letting the Spirit better be overwhelmed. Scary. It's time I mentioned what else was happening in our Turkish Obama house, and that was that all of us, employees, bike messengers, cabbies, felt some notchers' confusion so completely, we ourselves were about to cry. We would have been crying about this. Fight for us one. clogged up, and turned to the scene. It's not your conveyor belt on. We can barely breathe. On the television, Janet Lee starts to tell Synatra who she is, and she stops. Instead, Pelton Veradras tells him the apartment number and phone number. She gently asks him if he can move. So, my experience closes up to tell her. As you are sure how to take this response, because he's still here. Tannitly repeats the phone number. He turns even further. Shakespeare said, sliding, closed his eyes, and bearings. In that moment, finally, after attentively watching this, the whole group of us in Kababari began to cough. Now, everyone is choking back to yours. But by this time, many of us were choking on Shishin' Bob too. We were gagging into napkins. Downing our sodas, poking ourselves in the beds, crossing our hands that first. And then abruptly, just  that, in the scarred. We were okay. We were fine. We looked up the television. I would be killer. This breathing is not true. We're drinking my friend. To the end. To the end. To the deep. That's what's supposed to be true. That's what's supposed to be true.
