  "text": "From P.I. Public Radio International. From P.I. Public Radio Public Radio, Radio, Radio, International, International. Eric Yomans, Nose, Mr. Chupyam. But began with your soft photo in the magazine. Chupyam. This one. This is photo with his hand on his forehead and his eyes also pointed up the tears on his lips. some sheets and the bottom of the black and white photo was written in cursive lettering. I'm too sad to tell you. There's a run, it's charming and the man seemed unusually expressive and vulnerable. I just think I'm intrigued because his shows a man crying and you don't see that image very often and you don't see a man letting himself have his true emotions and yet he kind of pushes it away a little bit by sort of writing on there. to tell you. And actually there he is again. Yeah, he is again. It was hair longer. You see, now you see, you see the first person in the short hand and the second one was longer and I prefer it short. , the two photos, it definitely is a much more tracking to the one with his hair than the short. I'm just very, it looks very now. Both hair styles are very retro. 70s now, guys. But, , in fact, the photo was from the 1970s in Art Thuddo by virtually unknown Dutch artists named Basian Ader. Eric Irradi, article about them. And... The facts was  only enhanced the air of mystery and romance in the picture. He did a kind of conceptual art, Bosch Unator. This conceptual art that involved a lot of physical challenges that he had set for himself. In one piece he was photographed falling off the roof of the house. Another recalls out of a tree. The goofy, almost comical photos. But other works of this,  crying pictures, have a kind of wasteful, longing quality. There is something very appealing. it and very insat and I felt  I identified with that a longing and longing for what I don't know searching for something I know what is it. I didn't know I wanted to figure I wanted to know what he was thinking. And last piece he did was he's tripped it called and searched the miraculous and he disappeared and he's trying to sail the Atlantic in a 13 foot sailboat by himself and he ended up disappeared and his body was in a fountain and a year later his boat was down capsized on. because fire will be a big mystery. Welcome WB, Izzy Chicago, it's the American Life, my request. Back to another week, that's the American Life Museum at its dates. And today on our program, admiring some of them afar, trying to close their to them. At one, in search of the miraculous, at two, a thousand miles to miles Davis. At three, stalking snuggles, and at four, one thousand women becomes men up. Say what it's one term. When Eric is saw the future of Plasihan, it had been a while since he had had an adventure. For yearshe had been slugging away as director of the theater company. An experimental theater company. knew that was perpetually strapped for cash, perpetually struggling to get reviewed and get attention. It was frustrating. She needed to change. It seemed to picture a bossia, you might have to do that,  could be an adventure. I feel hesitant actually saying it, just flat out in those words because so few of us carry the idea that I should be an adventure into our adult years, a lot of you think the whole idea is really silly, but this is what Eric Yums believes. lived his life as an adventure. He was handsome, sensitive working, and he died for his art. And she decided she was going to find out everything about it. Make a film or a document. Even though she had never done anything  this before. She was about to turn third. It was time for a writer to pass. Birthdays, certain birthdays are supposed to be this big moment. It's supposed to be this big pivotal moment in your life. When I was 13, I had a birthday party called them fair. well the childhood which I had all my girlfriends come over and we had to dress  five year olds and it was  a very, my think about it is kind of the sick thing and it's embarrassing that I'm even talking about the hiccars. So at 13 I had this conceptual birthday party basically but performance concept of birthday party and then I had to have the whole thing costume done because I had to get over my childhood and so I think 30 was a big year for me because I kept thinking flyer to 30 that something was supposed to happen 6 30, don't know why. something. Eric and Tripe on Bossions, widow and Los Angeles, decided to make a pilgrimage. And rather than fly from Chicago, which you couldn't afford anyway, she decided she was going to drive. It would be more  Bossions, she thought. More a test of will, physical endurance. And events inspired to make it more of a test. And boy, I wouldn't give much time up. especially with actually to do the drive in two days, not three or four, which usually takes. Part of my drive out there to LA in some stupid small way was my attempt to be by myself in a journey that nothing has risk tied to it on, it's not really an athletic seat. And to drive a couple of days and then to forbid a car by myself to take a quarter and try to figure out if I'm going to be able to discover anything about myself, which I don't see anywhere. but I sort of talking to the take players if it was at first my driving partner and the second he became a therapist. So we went and it became a journal by the 48th hour became  my journal. Well I've seen it all. My arm is peeling. My driving arm is peeling. My wind should wipe it don't work. It's soggy and it's snowy and I'm thinking about taking lips. I was 18, 19. I was at the junior mid. My life, we have jumped around as many things. So many different relationships. I'm still not making money at what I wanted to. I started suffer from a real sadness. I was recording myself and I thought, , late at night. starting to agree with you. I'm doing this back, or it's way better than everything. So I think in everything will come to my consideration when I'm , well, I'm 70 years old. I get things from them just all wrong. And this wasn't, I kept comparing it, spasher on. , how is this adventure? How is this romantic? How is this? One of my, one of my trying to teach myself. One of my trying to, how am I supposed to grow from a sun tire? , I have too much coffee, but too many cigarettes. I haven't used anything that's healthy. Everything's been in cellophane. This whole thing of doubt, doubt, doubt. doubt, you're not knowing why I'm there and I'm stuck. Can't fly somewhere, or I am the middle of Missouri or, , New Mexico is the happiest finish in the city. Slow down. Okay. Woohoo, go go go go. I love this car. Please make it a love car. Life is a wood annat incident. If you ask a, how should you picture Basean's trip? His transit indexer, Mr. 13th of both. Chanters, about pausing. In addition to him catching his fish off the side of the boat and having a little mock-up, barbecue pit and grooming his fish and having his fresh water supply, even very little, fastened for a lot of it and riding a lot in his journals. And perhaps he was going through questioning things, but I don't think he was doing it in such a way. in a long way, in a melodramatic way, that I certainly will sound it on the tapes. I don't care if my right way, why I'm so wrong, you can't find me to see me. I'm wrong, you need to go for it! Herkidra, 15 hours a day, for two days. And the third day, things stopped and down. She barely ate, smoked nonstop. And this is your total friend, Marky, that she derived it, Marky. house around nine, she didn't hit the never-reaching outstarts plus inches. Which may not seem . It's millions of lanes of rows with an arouse. Friday night, which of course, , I pretend  this not going to be any traffic and of course there's a bumper to bumper traffic cars going really fast and I'm striving long and I start to feel really losing. And I get lose years I go on and as I'm into the game, into the actual city and I'm looking for the eggs from Army's place. I start called a panic attack where I know I know. I've never passed up my entire life. I've never, ever experienced that feeling. And here I was, and I know I was passing out and I couldn't stop my heart from pounding, couldn't stop myself from just either was going to vomit or I was going to pass out and I started panic. So I was shaking trying to get off this freeway with cars whipping around me at this point. I was going about pretty much an hour and I wasn't about to go in faster because I was really frightened. I was getting paralyzed. I couldn't get over the eggs. I finally , read my way around with people honking at me and I know I'm a tourist and seeing my place in the middle. I know they're saying always things and waiting for the gun to come out. I get off the exit and I'm in to never heard that looks really desolate. It looks really scary. It's really dark. There are no street lights and I start weeping. I'm on the side of the street. To see if I'm going to sleep here tonight, I'm never going to find Martin's house. I was completely, utterly frightened. I know what I was going to do. I pumped that myself. I started to breathe, breathe, breathe. I ate some peanuts. I was all having the car. So I got back on the freeway. I was meanwhile during this time. I'm in my car and I keep hallucinating and I'm melting in my car. And that my back of my car is melting into the freeway. It's  he's he's , How is late? She found a cool dog or a cold mark. He came and retrieved her in her pajamas. The next morning, Eric had didn't want to look at her car. There she had. And I went outside and I noticed that my back was your tire blown. And that was why I was hallucinating. I wasn't hallucinating. He said my tire blown. That's because he made me feel  it's melting in the freeway. And the face, the fat's of Eric is eventually not so much to stop him. a card drive three days long, a new interstate highway system. But what's remarkable about her story is that she was she was forced to wheel. She turned it into the right of passage and tested the joints. The chick wished for her when she set out. And once she would probably the next day, she called Basa on the wood up very soon and headed out to meet her. I was wearing these very, very, very fluorescent yellow cigarette. my army combat boots and my gas station jacket from the 50s. A very in jacket. I thought I fit in with the scene and sort of this art community in Bergomot Station. There's just all these galleries. I feel  there's a lot of groovy people and I want to look as groovy as I could. Mary Sue Lattaira, Nancy, anything she wanted to know. And somewhat what she said was very different. America's pretty picture of boss-off as an idolian romantic art girl. , I went to the voodermake. questions at this point trying to figure out what did he sound , how did he talk, how did he political, was he not, and there were very little short answers to these things. But in the course, after about an hour or so, talking, he started sort of explaining me about them, that he wasn't this perfect, beautiful, pretty, because I kept saying, he's gorgeous. And that's what she sort of said that I can't paint in that pretty though, dot, dot, dot, and how do we're problems. And that's when she started to sort of talk about the open relationships and sort of had a girl talk. about over relationships and how they don't work and  about the pain it was involved in the marriage. What happens when you admire some of them afar? Probably because they seem so sensitive and tragic . And then you find that there was sometimes kind of a jerk. In this case, it's basically how it onto a picture of Pasiang, as romantic feel man. And if you ask Mary Sue, she says there's something lovely about that. Yes, I'm sure Eric, it does have a romanticized view of who the who bossy on was and what he was of course . I think however that's just perfect. That's what bossy would have liked more than the real picture. I'm sure he wouldn't want me to explain to completely all the details. But one of the oddest things that this whole story is that Eric is sees Baziak's horror artist and she is. True artist. When in reality, she laborers, mostly in obscurity, following a vision that's completely video-syncratic, completely her out. Typical shell occurs is filled with odd, striking images, lots of strenuous movement of a typical dialogue, no story. Some shows seem to have an unusual number of people, growing themselves on. before, it's just to be hard to sit through. But from start to finish, they are clearly a laborer club and a laborer of sassure. But do you hear her talk about it? She has sold out and paired with Paseyot. He was more concerned about, and I don't want to say art for art to say, but he was more interested in what he was doing to himself, physically mentally by putting himself in these images and doing these different. tasks and I don't think he was that worried about if he was going to be a big famous artist or if he was going to be successful artist because he didn't even take care of the work we had when he had to read who died they they can't even find a lot of his work because he got damaged in a garage  because they didn't even take care of it. Christine McKenner writes about art for Los Angeles Times and she spoke with Eric about Fossil several times during her visit. This image of him as pure has more to do with there something Eric needs and it has to do with reality at home because, yeah because Erica really is every bit the artist's boss John was in terms of intensity and single-mindedness, . I don't, I don't, I don't know the authority on him, but I do know that he was just another guy hustling and all right,  everybody else. Basically, I got the impression that she... It was just completely romantic and shattered with him. And I didn't know if she was really even looking for the facts of his life. Once she came out here, it seemed more just  some kind of mythical class. And it was a very short history that he wrote. And that leaves her a lot of room to embellish it, . But I have to add, I mean I'm afraid to move by. by this whole trip that she made. I could totally understand it because, yeah, I thought there was something really beautiful about it. I mean, she was the pure one. She's more pure than he was. I'm sure. There's something so innocent in her vision of him and her quest to come out here and get, I don't know, quite what. And then in the face of all the evidence that I feel she probably came up with here, she went back home, same vision. I mean that's really kind of stubborn in sense. And it's pure in that, I mean there's no wish to make money out of this. She's not going to end up getting a date with the guy who's dead, . So she gains the purity of the obsession.

And then finally do get closer. Actually, you can look for them. What happens to the romantic dream that you have? Quinty True first heard of my old state. us back in 2016. I was in this all-way in high school, 3500 kids and Vong-E, Black kids that went to the school. So I was trying to find some way to be hip at that time. Tupers in East St. Louis and my house was far far. Part of what was appealing about my house, the fact that he had begun in St. Louis himself, and it got now. And of course my house was a blooper in the house. I was in a fish flat place. And I saw these four black guys sitting in this booth eating Jack Salmon sandwiches and dinners with dark glasses on hats The hair was cocked in everything so I thought they look pretty hip So I wouldn't set got my sandwich and set behind them and at that time They were talking about this homeboy from East Saint Louis and he was in New York City And he was doing all these great things and playing all this great music and played with Charlie Park who I didn't know any any of A� Submission and they said Miles Dewey Davis, Miles Dewey's name is Miles Dewey's and they went up to the record player and put in some money and played Donna Lee. I remember listening to Donna Lee and I said, I didn't  jazz up until that point. I was about 14, 15 years old. , I was into Johnny A's and Chuck Berry and that kind of music really blew. And when I heard this music for some reason on the, they played it twice and the second time kind of went straight to my heart. I don't know, I just... I can't explain why it went straight to my heart, but I kind of love the music. And I sat there and they sat there for about an hour and then they left. And when they left, I remember going up to the record player and I had about 30 cents because I've heard of the nickel plate of those records. And I went there and flipped through all those names and found Miles Davis's name and played down a lead and I played another one. That's when our first heard Miles Davies and then after that my cousin told me how hippie was and showed me pictures of him how clean he was. I started seeing how well he dressed and what kind of great style he had. How clean he was. Yeah,  we used to see his clean as a broke big dog. Which was a saying that came out of the same Louis and so I said wow. This is a guy I love, so I started really listening to his music at that time. You kind of changed my life and then I found some other friends who had been listening to him for a while and I kind of left my other friends and started listening to Miles and hanging out with them. And he's just sitting up in the stands at Summer High School and say we're going to run away to New York and be  Miles Davis. So I remember the first time he came to St. Louis, it was all this big buzz about him I mean, to play there. And I adopted up my draft card and changed all the late dates and everything so I could be old enough to get in the club. And I remember going to the pawn shop and getting these great suits and these churches shoes for too small for my feet. They were those really hip English shoes. And I had these big chest-to-feel hats and I was really clean. So, and then by my feet hurt, my feet hurt. Because the shoes are too small, the shoes are too small. So I go to... I got to get some friends in my end and we get in the guy and looked at me and said, oh, really? Because I was really young looking, but he let me in, five of us left me in. And when that band hit, they were so fantastic. They were so fantastic. Miles was so clean. He was so clean and so hip that I was just mesmerized. And so I told my cousin who went with us. And I wanted to go up and say hello to Miles and tell him how much I've left music and some of my cousin said, well, don't go up and sit in the mouth. And smile just to talk to him. He didn't  it. So don't go up to him. Just kind of look at him from the distance. So we kind of stood back and looked at him from distance. All of us were whole bunch of us. Young guys and older guys, but we had our glasses. And we had our glasses. And we had this glass. And we kind of looked at him standing before a smoking cigarette. Drick it up. Konya. And from behind us someplace, I heard this voice said, Oh, darling, there's Miles Davis. I turned around and he was just  guy with his girlfriend. And I said, wow, please, you're going to do this. I'm going to say hello. So he walked to us excuse me excuse me. He walked up to miles. They've been swooped in at the bar with cold training all of a sudden Hi miles are you miles sitting at breakfast F you get out of my face  that. I was That was stunning. me. I have never had never heard anybody talk to anyone  that Let's long after the American man said that to a white man, , and he and I just said must Now when was the first time you've been miles as an adult? Kind of a person you are now. Yes, I was living in New York and my friend, Leo Maitman, who was now deceased, was Dr. And he was miles to stop and he always said to me, , I know my wife. I said, get into this little mouth, get into this little mouth, get into this little mouth. So one day he said, I'm going to have this party. Okay, well, come us, yes, I go. part and I walk in and I'm sitting around and you get this great apartment. Look over here as mouth mates, my mouth mates. And it was nobody sitting next to him. His was the only seat in the half of nobody sitting next to him. So I wouldn't got to prove no look around, no place to sit and wouldn't want another one of them would not go place to sit. I came back there with this seat. So I said I wouldn't sit next to my mouth. So I remember him saying something , I said go in, I said I already. I said yeah, see the thing in here. I said what? Anything. What do you see? I said nice ladies, that's right. That's right. So yeah, let me talk about that. That's it. Okay, so then we had general conversation and then he went and got some food came back. Right. You laugh. So bad. two weeks later I was walking down the road on that part of the country. Sure. This is a kind of nervous moment for you. There are next to my house Davis. What was your feeling during this conversation? I was totally up for it. I had no fear and talking to him. I guess maybe because I was about his time I was starting to get a little play myself as a writer in New York. I was starting to get some ink and I had a kind of feeling about myself at that point. And so it was funny. We just kind of had this exchange. And then we got ready to leave. He just left. , it's loving but he came over to me and said, hey, I thought it was some kind of indication of that he He liked the conversation or whatever and so about breathing slater I was walking down Broadway He comes walking straight towards me Oh, this last name so when you got up next Hey, man, how's how you doing? He walked right back  I would  I didn't even exist That was even on the point I mean he didn't even lie This walk right back and that's not a rubber starving. I don't look back soon How is that mountain in the world? That's me at the same time. But he didn't speak. That's an aim mouth. He didn't turn around. , he's kept going. So that was kind of cold. I mean, that was kind of cold. It was , I'd never experienced that before my life. And so when I got to know him, , I probably got to know him. Well, when I did the spin magazine, I did a piece of two-part people. I've been magazine when I walked in his place. And he said, I said, I remember reaching out with a hand grab my dreadlocks and he is hand. And he said, what are you crazy? What are you crazy? Did I say no man I said, , because I'm over here to interview you, does mean that you have right to invade my space. I said, plus, plus the other time that I've tried to talk to you, you the shan real. He said, oh, you've been telling out of a street. the time out of the street I see here he said that I had to talk to you I had to talk to you what you got to talk about this time and that's the way it started and we got to be the best of friends I mean until he died I mean but it was  my father always tested he was always tested he was a kind of guy I'm lucky because it's always a kind of guy that was always tested as you passed the master he didn't get stand up to him. And then if he liked you, he would bring you in. If he couldn't, he just run over you. More with Miles Davis and Quincy Troop, also snuggles the Fabric Softford and Bear and 1000 Slinus. Ten a minute, public radio and international. We'll end off both. You It's a American light on my request. 20 troops spent three years vibrating myos Davis Davis's out of bed. talking to Davis and interviewing him actually until Davis got sick of being interviewed. To create a book written in Miles' voice and syntax, it sold over a million times. And to address Quincy, when did he stop seeing Miles Davis as the immediate legendary figure? It starts seeing him as just another friend. He really can't tell you, it was gradual. One day he was on the outside of Miles' life, and he knew. And then at some point later he realized that he was on the inside. , I get very opposed. with the miles. I mean, I was in his pocket and he was in my pocket for two and a half or three. I mean, until the time he died, I mean, I was really close to him. And so I saw, , flaws in his personality that, , , because I think when you idolize a person  him,  he was one of my heroes, especially when you young, you don't think they have flaws. You kind of see them through these roles to the glasses. And you kind of look at them's purpose. And so when I started to see some things that was not perfect about miles  his way. treating women and they're way of treating other people sometimes and little small things, ,  cleaning it sometimes. The cleaning is coming up in the interview a lot more than everybody gets. Yeah. Well, I mean, my house was a clean person. I mean, in terms of , is body and weight dressed, but well, there are a couple of times when I went over his house one day. And I went over his house when it was a mess. He messed up with everyone. Flows to brush to paste them. music, trumpet, that's it, miles, man, I said no, I said keep living  a pig, man, I said living  a pig, man, this is the pig, man, this is the pig, he said, so what? So what is a pig, man? What's your ex-bent? I just played music, jump, this is somebody crazy, that's the deal. When I would see some of that and first I would say, he's got to be a pay. But then I got to the point where I said, no, he's just a human being. He's a human being. He has flawed. He played beautiful music, but he had these little areas where he was just a human being. Where he was flawed. I never thought miles would be as country as he was. I mean, back country, I mean country, country  us. Southern, , instead of a jazz musician when you got to know miles  some elegant jazz musician miles  a country blues sing when when when did you first saw that that side of him really clearly When I was doing the book and I was about three or four months in when he started dropping the mass and he just dropped the mass when I come by an half-food and He cooked for me and we look at boxing matches and look at the basketball games and I quit first when I would go there Always be dressed elegant You're on very fashion stuff And then after that, he started dressing just really casual and especially on the West Coast When I grew up there and he had my blue jeans A torn sweater and he was just cooked and we just sit down looking tell lies and He listened to the fights and we go for long walks on the beach and taking the grass and it's hard So it was just a  it was a beautiful kind of relationship It was matter of fact I told him I said  when you can California you're much different Your Yes, yeah I got to keep my mask up, I said, yeah, that's right, get to keep it up. When did you first figure out about the way you was treating women? When did you first figure out? Well, when I started to hear some of the story, , my house was brutally honest, and it was brutally honest when he did it. Told me, I remember telling me the stories of him beat up these women and chasing his wife around the basement of the house and he was , I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And then, , so I started thinking about it. Wow, this is out, ? And then this is a strange kind of situation because I'm just the opposite. I don't believe in him when I don't believe in anybody. But I figured out that Miles Davis was kind of person. He wasn't an intellectual, so he could respond and talk it out. , talk the whole thing through. So if you got up in this space, well, you were a man or a woman. , he would hit you. That was the way he was. He would hit you. I can be tru-cool and say I didn't  the way he did certain things, ? But then at the same time we knew him really well knew that he was a warm and generous person to us, ? And we'd look at those things and say, hey man, that was the power of the power, what you did there. But , I mean, the way I looked at that said, well, , that's between him and that person, ? I've never saw him here, a woman in front of me. Because you've got to remember, I knew him from 1985 to die for six years. And so when he was in his most desperately insane period of really doing these patterns of women, this was from 1968 to 1988 to 2012. ever saw that. How could it be a occasional moment sometimes when he'd get to be friends anywhere it would suddenly strike here? Yeah, I'm friends, my favorite. What would generally happen was when somebody would come up to me and say to me, man, what is it  to be with my house? Davis, , I always wanted to be with my house, and then I would be and I would think, whoa. But for me, after it got to a certain level, I never thought about it because we had this natural relationship called me up on our calling up. I remember telling somebody, my mouth called me up from the pan here, just take this new thing. He said, what you think it is? He put it on. And it's paper about bad news. And it's the thing. And I was telling what that might do right there. And if I didn't  it, I'd tell them I didn't  it. And I was related to somebody. And the last day was called you up. He puts on the tape. Listen to her? I said, yeah, he said, what? What's that right? I said, man, I guess it's  any one of my friends who's a poet, ? Who said, listen to this poem,  what I mean? Just so happens, it's mouth-dated, it's music, and he happens to be internationally famous. Many public figures, at close, lose the larger and my clock, that they seem to have fun. There's something about miles that even today even the 26th is close to miles 6. There's never been to anybody in this night. Even to the head. It's easy to point to the sea miles. Is this mythic? It says miles just had to be there. I remember one time it was  I was with him. I can't remember the Japanese, not Miyashi, but it was another Japanese design. We had his clothes in the yard. And... And he had his clothes and he had Andy Warhol before Andy Warhol died. And Miles Davis modeling the star models of clothes along the all these beautiful garter swimming. So Miles Robinson's gonna go that way. That's it. Yeah, I know this. So you're going to sprays called the tunnel, or something, of a district. So we're there and they're mowing the clothes. Everybody's going on a mountain block out of Andy Warhol. So I'm backstage. And with Andy, , these are two magic. , these are two American eye cards in culture. So  for them, and they're a deal with one of the games. And if they don't get to anyII yeah. I'll just connect that to some of montage go MA. So Miles was the thumbnail and he had this outfit with this gold land-made cute. I mean, it's gonna be , what a hat. So he started walking out of Andrew's clothes and looking at it. And the cake was dragging on the floor. So he started walking and turned on, look at any guahal. And pick up that cake. And pick up the tape. And then walk out together. You don't even know how to make that. And he had this sheet of slud at the space. And Miles got it at length. It was holding the cake off the floor. they walked up the page and so everybody in the room, they left us in the room and these handlers, they were not shocked and they never heard anything  that. You're , wow did you see that? Did you see that? But Andy was smiling and he was , happy to be in it. He was , happy to be in it. So that was, , my uncle, he was , oh, it's  a king. He doesn't even  a king and so that's the tick. But at the moment I remember him saying I remember his attitude of  I'm the king here pick up the game people might be I can't I can't in you When she truth the walkie mouse Davis is out of the out of the miles Oh, it and journalists messa. That's not the whole thing. This is called admiral Now we have this sort of fact. This is act three of our program, Snuggles. From 19, 80 through 1995, dying to your grand what he called an apology wife. Nadi as a people would call about their call as anonymous wife and made it apologize for anything they believe that they had done. That was worthy of apology. himself really comes from this from the start, Mr. Apologize to an MSLM bridge. And over time, , people would apologize in some apologies to the media and some big things, some of these some combination to the main panel. And then people could call an MSBON to the Apologize as well. Anyway, this particular apology was transcribed in the Apologize Apologize, and I'm on the floor. This is a, but snugly good. from our August meeting. Subscribe to the channel. I have an apology for me. And this goes as if it could have passed through the same. As watching TV and it commercial came, there's a bunch of bad ex-o. There's a small thing over there. It's not even. It's not even as it was stolen from the British. It's a product. Bad one is something. And I don't know what it was about this pair of players passing it. Small pair, high pitch voice, between the sets. That's it. may have it. I'll pass. A few days later another commercial come on again. Once again I stop what I was doing when I watched. This time I kept watching. Hope you get the station mark. I hope this commercial will come back. I'm sure enough later on in the evening another commercial will not be different commercial. I'm the same snobby snobby snobby same Potter. I went to the supermarket and I saw the Potter and I saw the features I purchased the Potter. I didn't use the... Soften 80 fabrics, you just wanted that picture, snubbing in. I would snubby bear a letter, and I was hoping for an answer, but I didn't receive one. I never done that with one. I hoping to get some sort of response, a photograph, an autograph, something. Still no response. I wrote a third letter and I'm afraid it was rather a sad, 100-year-old letter. I was saying something that I was turned up with the FBI. I was willing not to touch a conference, snubby bear again. Snowberry girl travels around. I believe the bear is one resident in Martha's Vineyard, and another resident in the West Coast. I'm not sure where the West Coast residents is, but the vineyard of the Martha's Vineyard Residers. Tell all this out there. There was of course a certain amount of security around the house, but I got myself there. I climbed the gate and I thought the window opened around the back of the house. I'd rather watch house, I wanted to round. It was an element of course. Here, she wasn't home. I'm sure he was out on the road in this inch. There. So, well, I can only reach snugly bear. I can only make snugly bear understand that I understand. I'm sure if I get through to snugly bear, then I'm sure we could establish a relationship. I just didn't understand it. But the way it's going now, if you can use a limbo, every time I try to contact this bear, I'm bored and I'm calling to apologize because I guess I've been a bad boy. I'm not stalking someone there. They'd accuse me of stalking someone there. I'm not stalker. simply wants snugly to understand that I understand. That's all. I'm sorry. For somebody who heard that apology in the apology, I'm in the call-in with this message. This is how to demand a wise fixation on Snuggles Bear. I do understand and I would really  to give my emotions for it. I do care. I sort of had a similar experience with the graphic time dog and actually managed to get together. I'm very even say his name. We did manage to get it together and I got into his life. He accepted, I cared about him. But you can imagine, you see him all the time with TV, and the life of the cop is difficult. I just didn't know when he'd be coming home at night and I couldn't take it anymore. I'm also afraid of him. of the crunching. Basically what I want to say to you is maybe loving from afar is the best thing to do maybe it's possible you never actually get to meet small ones. Because then you have this pure disinfection 5mg snails. You take care, bye bye. 1. Hack 4. 1000 more. It's one thing to admire someone from afar. Try to get close to it. It is another thing to actually try to dress as someone you admire. Try to look  them, try to keep them numb now. Even for a day. That's a happy reason to hear. Pagga, Pamanthai High School. Peace.

It's just a constraint to be  Sulev. She wants to be a single and sing it English in Spanish. She came to the auditions but not just so she could be a movie star. It's as she wants to be a close to Sulev. I don't want to do the movie from money or anything because money is not there. Money is not everything. Look at what I brought Sulev, nothing. I want to do it because I want Sulev to see me what I'm doing. I just want to do this scene. A lot of people took cry on Selena. She was so lovely. Just for smile. She was  a little girl. When she went to the Grammy Awards, she went there with camera. Wanted to take pictures, everybody. To another part of the project, she made it seem  it's not bad to be Mexican American. I just didn't spend how she thought of Selena's life. She said a crying. Okay. I love it. I love it. Then I said crying too. She is my best friend. And a lot of people see the Xeranchru and the people don't know how she is. And she was a very nice person. She was a very nice person. Because I'm a success in a bit of a horror. So they were talking to me and it was ... I was so happy. After Salinas, that just a family means with a great and gorgeous kiss. I was saying, y'all now is , how do you do the great and I asked myself, after we died, just saddened, and I said to her, I think I sang omolaflor, and I mean, because it reminds me of her. I was so happy. The words mean I could fly with much love and gave to me. All march and I know how to look and love but oh my, how it hurts me. A lot of people say that she might be dead and stuff but she's not dead as as she's sleeping. She's sleeping for a long, very long time. and wherever she is in heaven or wherever she's probably singing her heart up there through. I'm at also the people of the dishes. Everybody was really good stop and look fabulous. There was the Lenin music everywhere. TV cameras, girls and fixing their hair and putting them make a fire. People were dancing at one point. We were talking to the two girls. Saying this as a lanus song and pretty soon people who didn't even know were joining Everybody we seek it was just that kind of thing One of the girls we make keep all the way from New York with her mother and her little sister It was kind of a secret mission So that's it home The mother told her husband that she was at a Mary Kaye conference in Philadelphia and the daughter's will be spending the weekend at the older sister to stop. Then she flew the Marta Chicago for all this shit. Yeah, that's good, Mama's is a dark. I got a first. When you finally get inside to the audition, it's kind of the tip point. It's  it's over before it starts. There were  20 girls on the stage at a time. This is the two down at this table. Give you this fixed smile. Henshaw carted below. As you want questions, then try to stand up and dance. You dance for 30 seconds. Sometimes you don't even play music. When I went up, the woman running my table didn't even know who Selena was. She didn't buy it to look at me. When we were dancing, they only gave you 60 seconds total to make an impression. So what are they looking for? Magic. Well, I don't know. That special magic that made Selena that she's very outgoing. It's an incredible entertainer, very gifted, very beautiful. This is a direct feedback map. He told me that with real dishes. In-fifth. I thought if he was magic I'll give him a message. I don't know about just, but everyone I interviewed she had possessed. She looked  a son and she had big dreams  some. And she has to learn in part. I want to show you this girl in a person. Oh she's beautiful. So she has to be a she here. She left her room. She told me that she was busy. She made me cry. She doesn't want to get paid. She's not around here. I dare to. If she sits remotely, then she will be paid. I thought that maybe the addition could just be publicity stuff. That series of decisions, something Selena definitely would not approve of. But the writer said, they were most likely to put a little girl on the open ambitions. And there was a picture chance they picked a big sum. After a long day, it crossed that clear. Two cousins who flew in princesses were sitting outside in the cold, eating pizza, and well-bushed by her family friends picking up. They had a bright bird in the morning and they didn't get much sleep. They were sure when the rabbits come all the way they were going to spend the night. I asked them to be out of dishes. Hi no so I think the children is a great part of the game. Yeah, Cheers! Well, because  it's  I don't make a producer where they when I got to My stuff will sell I don't know they look or stuff something different Just because the people they choose  they talk to you that don't even I don't know they're parents. They're not looking for a more deeply. They're not looking for a choice figure They might know who's So we know what's been actually what she meant to us. I'm gonna say, girl. They have spent 100, 35 dollars each, safe and babysitting to get to Chicago, but they didn't feel bad. No, it's fine because , get a lot of money, no, I keep going. We just came, we know, we didn't get picked, , but we see okay, I mean, take a chance because that's the thing, that's the thing that's the thing I would say, , we have a thing, you go, , go for it, , don't let nobody put you down because they say, well, we already chose the person, , deal. and whatever you have, and as we did. So that's, or even while we came here. They just sat there on the bench weight. They weren't really dressed as we were. They were fishing at panty holes, real short shorts, boost days, and thin leather jackets. You could tell they were really cold. They were anxious for the ride to show up. A couple weeks later, it was announced that none of the girls from the open additions were chosen for us to land up. Not them, not them. I'm not just a pop. No, but... I was just going to Smith. We don't know, we have to get our right for a scene and then we know where to go. Right, I could get rid of some crisis. The calm. Of course, some party. Come on, come on, come on. Now the Paris is a routine road. Former high school dropout. Please make that a high school. We're going to see if that's the art in Smith. to Chicago in the fall as we can put a full time job right now this is her second. But remember she says she means famous but now we are the best. So, Calia so, so, explain why this is the song you were in the list of play on a program after story about some. I  it because she seems to work on my dad too. It's an old song for Mexico. I  to sing it. Right you don't that's why she did. sing with my dad she was more of a beaty person  what a lot of beat and that's why this song this one is other song and she sang everybody sang it was when she left everybody sang when she left and then the same where she got yeah listen to you you sound  that girl in the story who's  she's not dead she's just say where you said that when she left she didn't just leave that song Naaa- anyити So For today's program was produced by the Warriors Wilbur in myself, and let's see up to the next speaker.
