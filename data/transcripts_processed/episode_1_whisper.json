Three, one, one, three. I'm. Yes. So, , all Greeks, we can do the back. And tell me, come out and tell me what you say. Say you're being cam. Let's do a fight and let's try it out. Do  one great thing about starting the show is utter and a limited. No, you're just going to expect from you. This interview did not know us from Adam. You can work about a minute, a one minute five into the new show. You can. It is stretching in front of us. Perfect feature. You have to be careful. And then start a little bit of work. You have to be familiar to the world, maybe with a scar or something. Maybe hearing my words right now is thinking, It's a little man. Oh no, that show. That one used to be good. I was sure I never missed that show. Back in the old days, back in the first couple years, before it got so caught popular. Back in it is still good. Actually, I think that the force, that human desire, to say that, to say that, to so strong, to say that I was there, I was there back in the show, it's good. That course is so basic to who we are as people. That I know, , we are two minutes into the program. , that somewhere out there, one or two of you are saying, Oh, sure I used to look into that show back in the first. 30 seconds. I couldn't used to be really good. Remember that? Remember that back when you used to do all that crazy stuff when they had that guy on the phone? Remember back then? Well, that'd be easy. In the glorious city of Chicago, Illinois, then this shows your radio playhouse. I'm a... MnC. MnC. I regardless. I'm going to do that. Yeah, this show, this name is Shari's Stories. Some by journalists and documentary producers  myself. Some just regular people telling around the stories. Some by artists and by artists and performers, all different kinds. And the idea is we're going to bring you stuff you're not going to find anywhere else. And just going to be music. And tonight's show, we thought, we would have to be thinking about the thing in tonight's show is going to be new beginnings. And to keep things off of God, the man who's had it. as best as anybody can tell. The longest running program in history of television. This name is Joe Franklin and is put in ran for 43 years. On local television in Europe and he claims that he invented the talk show for an ant. And I thought it would get some advice and had it create a long running healthy program. I've called it many times. I get who's ordered the DNA of your state's new law. I'll be your kid, but I'll be called in. Give me a kind of advice. and the kids on the blocks, the corner Brian and the on the first show. People  that, there's no guy in this matter. The paying attention, you have boys, I've heard so much about the sparkle, about the energy, you have boys, boys, boys, on radio stations, everything. And when the guest is sitting with you, that looking to his eyes, , anytime you get in the orgrant there, he's scratching the, sitting there, he's rather being home, he's  the shower, and the bubble. I should just pay attention to keeping the eye. You can see everyone in the air. Right. Get in the fog, Earl. And I think he's all looking at nose or the belly button. Look right in the eye, I contact everything. As I say, it's a lot of fun. , I never call anybody my lights come on. , , they don't feel the belly button. , I heard about you and I called. I said, we should go to the bug that I read. Imagine the thrill of your on it can be working in a nice studio. Great, Nick is Ronald, great in five times being crushed in. I got a major book out right now, but the way I recall, Bob made the deal for instance, Simon Wilson, he's finding copies of the store. You see now, I guess I've sort of messed out. We're not because I didn't know you getting your plug-er away. See that as much as I got it, and so it's better. It's   two games, and you'll just have a series, what the deal can go and say. I think I've had no control against me at the cards at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Look at that. Good loose pick. It's worth it. It's worth it. Think of anything that's higher rouse. But if you look at your fan, how we've been judging. Darling, take a trip in my rocket ship. We'll have our love all afternoon. Just a little bit but. And all we will find is destination moon. We'll travel fast as all I do will have a sight. The first will be  the time move. I want to thrill you, get a lot of information on my gym. A destination move. All right, you're ready to play house. I'm making eye contact with you right. Where do you have to put it? Let's see. Great. I'm not joking. I am making eye contact with you right now. That is just how much I have already won. So the thing about newbie. The one that we actually undertake, , and then the one that we just wished for, and the one that we wish for, and he much outnumbered the one that we really undertake. Well, Kevin Kelley spent most of his 20s wandering around Asia, and he was a freelancer, and he was basically wandering around his freelance photography. He found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies and drawn to these lawsuits, and he says that he was really confused about what he believed. And he... He was the kind of person who always drank about and you'd be getting with you wouldn't struggle with his questions. I would get twisted and caught up and these things were sort of in a background to certainly mean actually found that that was I could think about little else for many, many months that behind all that I was doing there was always this unresolved question this was God! ignore and infuse, to remove, not ignore what we do and this was real and what about these other things you can do soon about God. We will not attempt to answer these questions in this hour. I just want to just get you sense of stuff here, okay? Just modest sort of stuff. But we want to talk to you about this. What happened to Kevin Todd? What happened is that is that at the age of 27, all of this teams, when they came into Jerusalem, on the eve of Easter and Passover, the same weekend. And, , lots of people, more familiar with it. So I entered Jerusalem on Easter, with a simple expectation that I was going to follow Gras, another religious sermon, religious festival, and then, , for various reasons I didn't lock down from my hostel, and I'm thirsty. Didn't need a bank account. And I was in quite a fixed because I was a stranger in this very strange town. When it happened, I didn't have enough money to stay elsewhere and order my wife and her. I already go. So I wandered. The old town of Jerusalem at night, which we had been choded up in this time of abandoned mansion is sitting. were gone, what was left to be revealed. The breathing and paths have covered the passageways and wandering down for the number of elves used in folder. Eventually I found myself at the one place that was still open, which was to see the churches and particularly after one round, two weeks in the morning, I found myself into the church. receptor, which is called, in viewed as the church built over the mound where Jesus Christ was crucified. And it was getting very tired and there were many people around and so eventually I laid myself out in the, but only flat area. Left face lá, the slabbied  a god from nesse enormous underneath. In this world's resume wave, when. the slab that commemorated the exact position for the process. So I slept there. I slept there until I slept there until I slept there until I slept It took early morning that TV started to increase the system. I went out and followed the crowd where it was going and they were going up to the tools and to the machine. Nothing there was some chair set up, full of chair set up and fun for me. It was just a trunny area and as the sun was coming up on that Easter morning. I was staring at empty tools and for a reason that I cannot comprehend as I sat on that chair, contemplating and contemplating this view of the sun, the only sun when you come into the empty tools, all that I had wrestling with for the past many, many years and something about religion, sort of came to the end of my mind. that very moment, believed that Jesus Christ had indeed risen from those tools. In an instant, the attention of trying to see what things out, is as often because now suddenly, anything was figured out. This is if we were working on a problem for a long time and suddenly being so sick, I would certainly clear that we see it. So, although there were many things, but still, not fear to you, you were very certain, I don't know, I'm telling you. Having that realization, then, , that I believe that Jesus Christ had actually risen from those tombs, did not settle a thousand new things about what one was supposed to do, that what I was supposed to do to that one was supposed to do, to that one was want to let me know? and then I have to immediately announce all that I had and didn't get into that class and asking March up. So, it does it. There was all that was left and open, and that is in fact what occupied my mind as I went back to my, to my, to my, to my, to my, to my, to my, to my, to my down, and think about this. So, I knew, clue what it really needed to me, , to me, and that's who I am. Are doing. So, this is laying there and happening. I would say it's a voice that there is an idea that came into my mind that just we're not going away in that, but that I should live as if we were dying in six months, and we should really truly live. And then I cannot tell for certain whether I really died with that, and then either way that should live as if I was going to do it. So, that was the assignment. I'm a pretty rational person and I'm pretty logical and I have to think in the thought that I should live as this one, to 9, 6 means the first thought that comes in the head of this one. That's pretty simple. You have no evidence whatsoever. I could live  in the 10, 6 means in that time. I'm just pretending to be interesting, I'm sure so. But it's the same time. is equally probable that I might die systems things, having all the time, there's no guarantee that I wouldn't die. And so, fairly quickly, I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I really die or not, and just think that I was going to die as a smart senior to... In the end, the case is the important thing is to live as if I really believe I was going to die as a smarts. Which is not enough to do. Next couple of days, I will kind of join experience of seeing to myself, okay, what do I do for six months if I haven't subscribed to this? And we have the answers to that. Surprisingly, as much as we are signing because we have to think about it. So, we can continue to join this. The conclusion. that it came to is that what I wanted to do is the system is supposed to go home and be ordinated to the back of my pants to help them take out the trash and turn the hedges and those furniture around and to be with them. And I was very shocked by that because I thought that this system is to be by the same ever system, student identity appealing to the people, that sort of street service at the same time, to indemn texting. I want to go back home and do some sanding for the time. Of course, do not tell anybody that crazy I do. This is something for the first time talking about it publicly because it was a very scary and sort of alarming idea. never moved to a room where files came from. I got back to where my parents lived in the Jersey and things were underling the ordinary. I found myself Welch in the ordinary serious, social sorts, etc, I just intend to take- thing related to human Storageراbs Adventure Watch-This is End Univ End End End baking Fascist But about three months into that, my travel or the dentist got the better of me. What I was most concerned about is I wanted to see my brothers and sisters, who I had and four brothers and sisters, they were scattered on our Christian children. So, you felt very strongly that I wanted to see them before I died. And I got the idea that they were to see them, so I'm a bicycle or a Christian children. And visit them on Wednesday. But before I did that, I made up a will to suppose if the little things are there. And I had some money left over and really things. And I do that really really really. Into the bank and got some cashier shifts for five or five or five or five or five or five or five or five or five or five or five or five. And I nailed the money to various people and honest as gifts. And six. given way those thousands of dollars was the first true act of journey and everything because it was absolutely no way so any kind of gratitude in the feeling of succumb back to me because I didn't know I didn't get something from me. It was really remarkable to see the consequences of getting an anonymous gift  that because I didn't get a check. for a thousand dollars in mail. You immediately become suspicious of all your friends if having given it to me. And so there's this sort of suspicion of charity's suspicion goodness that starts to affect. The people that are around you, you look at some money from home, we're a city in the thousand dollars. Vietnam I wonder if you gave me that thousand dollars, then you're actually nice to them. And the next person you see next to your country, that could this be the person. And then you're actually nice to them. , I almost want to begin a little speech or about let us all now take up this practice. All of us all. If you want me to sound with my voice, if we all could just do this right now. And I will be if a little radio show just 19 minutes into the park that I can see. to live with them in a semot, helpo反field F had enough money to left over to basically pay for food in what not in Article Genet for Latin passing head of the Republic of house after workshop , U.B. you're gonna fade could y. The day which was definitely, was exactly six months from when I had the assignment was October 31st was Halloween. So the plan would be that I ride that cone to come back to dawn on the day after Halloween. I think there are a lot of people who have trouble staying in the present. There are some people who  to slip into the past as it means to perhaps fantasize or escape. They find that the past is the place that they retreat to. And I often retreat to the future. I was not a person who planned or had a career staged out in the world who had particularly the women's work. in the area of San Vizio, or in the house. The future that I found so hard to develop in San Vizio, is the most more of the city's type, is that of... I'll let you buy this record because in the future, I want to hear the song being done. I will read this book and there's some cool ideas, because someday I may write an article about this and this kind of... It's good to know that. There was a sense in which my entire life was shifted to the future and the thought of doing something now for the enjoyment of the pleasures of the principle of dysfunction just right now without any sense at all that it would be used again that it could ever be brought forward was extremely difficult in disconcerting and they fought it day by day complained to us Hmm. When the way is adult, is that I was actually able by the last weeks to not think about my life beyond how mean there was there was a way in which I had just each time I thought came up about something that was beyond this horizon and just said nope, can't think about it and doesn't work we have to see from present And at the same time I was doing that and I was able to do that. I also decided that there's an unnaturally new thing that you need to be able to do. And that having a future is part of what being human is about. We need to take away the future for humans, to take away the humans. And it's not actually a very good thing to live entirely in present. One needs to have a past. And one needs to have a future to be so as you need. It was a journey that began with the tune of Jesus and as I fell off to the young Energien Cuzillini education, F Jesus Christ who came to the task of Jesus. So, Render Jesus is on life in a very knowing way. So, we have the history in the task of Jesus. Clement and Saul, as I see across where he knew of this, his anointed time to die. Jesus is again that that very harsh information is knowing and dying. and Jesus saw this, this was great turmoil and pain because knowing that, and I did, I think I did experience some of that not because I had the same weight, I was just my own life, but Jesus prayed that this burdened me left it in the newer days and I did pray that, this is going to have to tell me good. of not. By late fall, I was peddling through applications and was getting colder and colder and my hands were facing the bicycles and they seemed tense and we got up and down. As we stayed in our hands, coming close from close to each other and I was slowly looking into putting more pressure on anyone come out of the the I was writing to New Jersey. It was related, I was related that I had to accomplish this long journey. And I was related that I was home to see the parents in to their house in Halloween day. And I was so filled with ideas and things and emotions that I didn't really save very much in the beginning and couldn't save or not. I think we had a wonderful dinner there, of course, glad to see me because they hadn't seen me in the morning. I was coming down to you. We had wonderful dinner. That's the subcandy that I gave out to the kids. And we had a discussion that night, which was about nothing in particular. It was not about the future. It was just about talking about our filming, the basic sisters and just telling me more about the idea. And then we were glad to see me. So it was a very together and not a very dramatic, you need to just a pleasant one, kind of one that you might have a memory about as you were dying, which was not special, you need to just know, I would have been dead that night, which was a very difficult thing to do because I fully, I was fully prepared at that point, led it to a long time again. and crying and got nervous and arranged in iris that we fully gone through my own mind, my own soul, all the things that I might have regretted when I looked. Why did this is many of those as I thought it could be letters and iris prepared as as much as I knew could be prepared to die. So I need to bed while the kids were still in doorbells. It's a suitcase… I want to go. And I didn't know what was going to happen in the stay of this done on my commute. And the next morning I woke up. The next morning I woke up in the assists. The next morning I woke up in the assists. I had the next morning I woke up and I had my entire life in tenor. Cruze fapping spatial card today always uses Mamma Ordner or Deon.

Thank you. Yes. Romantic law? Sure. And people have expectations about relationship. And one of the things I believe is that there are a lot of people who are good at beginnings, but they're not good at medals. Which means why? Means that they  the beginning, where there's all this idealization, where romantic projections and the other person can be who they're. who they think they should be rather than who they are. And when you get to the middle, say, I'm just going to stop the tape. All right, this is all of your audience right now. It's just a degree right now. It's the very beginning of our relationship. It's a very deep meaning. If I read your relationship, I'm going to have to solve it a first and a radiating need. And I just don't any idealizing on either side. And this is make eye contact right now. I'm just hoping so that the eye contact. And I'm doing this. It's where there's more of a reality they're through a relationship. And they kind of go off. That away from it. You did this not as exciting? So, Jim, you said it because actually as we've approached the first show, I've realized that I am much more comfortable with the notion of kind of everyday work-a-day sort of radio work. And , , having, this is a little... But the notion of saying, , in a really big way, okay, this is the beginning. It's the beginning, and we're going to have  a big beginning, and we're going to make an epic statement. I feel very... uncomfortable. You got to see work at it, middle. I better I think it matters than it needs. What? It's good to practice where you're always white in the middle. We've gotten so deep, . I never expected that it was going to be, there was going to get so deep. This is just, I'm just very pleased. I had deep this has gotten. Are you sitting there thinking it's making fun of me? What's happening? Yeah, we're right. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. You can nothing to do that. Are we going to get a take of it? Depending on your hands. We're out of the ship, are we? Depending on your hands. Okay. All right. Well, that's my mom, Shirley Glass. Speaking to us in Baltimore. I don't think she's listening to that. I do not think she's listening to anything.

They're just back from performing in Glasgow. Scotland is going back there in January to collaborate with the performance artist Ron E. Thee, the search title. Basically, we contacted Lawrence and we told him the story that you heard on the show. He's going to be a very good singer. He's going to be a very good singer. He's going to be a very good singer. He's going to be a very good singer. Basically, we contacted Lawrence and we told him the story that you heard on the show. over the course of the last set out, I'm telling you how to story.

And as you turned out, when Warren's figure found out, the day that he found out that he was each every posthuming. This was five years ago. On that day, it was the exact day that he and a friend left on a cross-country car set. So we commissioned him to do a little piece about his experience. title, road, treatment. It's not entirely on video, mostly in town. Shekki and focus on the color of the blood color actually. The effects are sort of very colors are so weird. I don't know what colors are. The colors are so weird. I don't know what colors are. The outlines of the images, the silhouettes we see over and over. And not. in fading and touching me. I'm gonna get this microphone adjusted also, I don't have to be nervous. 1, 2, 3. Sambo, yeah. Sorry, thanks. The story concerns Luke. Game, white, Midwestern, late for miss. Files Luke on the day that is in front of his edge only part of stairs. Nick cops a stance of cold. Not unlike the HOSN 4-maneration on the blade one, but there's a hint of vulnerability to the deep. You got to hear some forward at a bucking however, it's great. Roll. Great, talking under me. Storyfought this great story follows Luke. He's accompanied by his college buddy Bill and both their packs for a road trip across the country to San Francisco. This isn't the right section to move on. Just tell the guidance. Locations. Current area. Gas station exterior. H-I-V-C-N parking lot. H-I-V-C-I-C-I-C-I-C-I-N interior. I mean. Music is... Strausses for... the last songs, particularly Rua, my new season and some by Dame Janet Baker. Can you take it into me? Follows Luke in his friend Bill to the gas station and to the clinic. The last stop before getting on the highway. Okay, take it off. Take it off. Bill loads one hits his pot while driving on the way to the gas station into the clinic. The clinic. Can we mix that strat music? It's coming to more and more solid. There's really no music on the soundtrack. It's stark. Christ, maybe some songs coming from radio at the clinic's desk. Great. And definitely on from a car radio mixed with surfing on the A&R radio. No music. The drama is constantly being undermined through the cool collective quality of Luke's demeaning. He seems to touch. Quote. And not sure how I see him. He's feeling a little sad. Sort of man. I guess playing. And I'm okay. I'm sure I'll get a little more in the moment. And come. Luke thinks he's sounding  a short story as Simon and her creator. writing clans or worse, trapped inside and writes in novel. The accommodations and self and the television dramatization of themselves. Camera pulls back from the behind-the-scenes head, sort of on our mini-creams, camera floats, covers over the back and looks ahead, the ceiling of the car must be included in the three-stomachs. Bill pulls into the closest parking spot in the ended. Close out the last of the one head and there's a knocking brass pipe into the actuators to look at that slightly watery looking size from too much intake. Look, takes it as one of those clear barramas, that is experienced before something long. A little clumsy since building this to forces me as into a simple third posture. Quick, close up on the corner of things mouth. There's a moment of anger slashing him. The opening register is built-in. My and Bill asked him what was thinking about Little Chris Mons Who's thinking Nothing I hate thinking in the novel I think it's true himself Cut to interior of the clinic Researching area Who changed the soundbed here? Great. And take it down. Just to see the moon. In the scene that we talked about on the phone, the clinic waiting room scene that scene flips back and forth between various security black and white cameras mountain at the scenes. The nurse assigned to the looks and non-ness number is a black drag queen and Stephanie. The fold nurse is absolutely lit at people's hat that sits atop of her function in the cloth's hairdo. She's the only one in the clinic where I was a really young son. Stephanie is the longest finger in the house that Lucas ever seen on anyone. Luke thinks recently about how the swimming nurse keep on belonging to the nursing person dollars. He pushes that thought away in the swimming nurse to his forehead. recognise her and say what she's ditin' in the living. that novel is in the movie. Stephanie, the drag queen knows walks look back to the small cubicles that the tests are in the instrument, and then is to be living results. Looks near-medium imagines how many people have been in this dream cause and what they would take by because they were all piled on top of one movie. And all of this happens. Cut to stuff neatly closing the hollow sleeves… the door and makes that how long the core of the world seemed. We haven't taught. Perfect. Maybe a thought from the security community shows all of the people who are using the clean. Look, imagine themselves in a George talking thing that was reproduced in his sixth or a radio. He wonders what his sixth grade teacher would think of something new. He wonders if his sixth grade teacher was in a testing. He maddens a body. and play with the body of the opponent. Staffness is insane, being a lukist and being designed in the rhythm is an issue. He explains to staffness that he has been expecting this result and his experience to lighten with his kids, following  my favourite lightest frames, and it doesn't seem to come with a surprise. Staffness is, you can climb, who break near, and I just need to sit for a moment and make sense. Cut to build a new, flipping through people's digging pictures. Cut back to close to the view for a hit bring-go. If he faces new order, wants him to get on the physical call. He waits for stuff he needs to finish his shit. Thanks for doing the checks and then, Then he will slide straight from one of the seemingly as close up on the roof sand and scratch. And while seeing to tossing as new. walks down the hallway to the reception room. Who tries to do is blind as possible to do I'm not sure about this line of section but we talked about it in the middle of the highway put the car being surrounded by bikers and the way to the sturgest bikers are  that now I know I  the idea of it anyway my way and can be seen cut to interior of car being on parking lot The book keeps looking straight ahead as a murmur's and positive. Long same pan from the back of Luke's head to the back of Dils. There's no reaction in either of their faces or that he profiles into faces. This is the one in this shot. Do you need a join? Perhaps the scene would be shot in Blue Screen. with the camera in the back seat and the sky surrounding the two hints of bill and milk having that old scratchy 16-meter turning line of exposure to the clouds and the new moving rapid pace flickers flip-spacting forth between real sky and blue screen back door voice comes up on a car radio trying out to think of the future which is living it's not even a normal engine something  that you got it it seems to be really I also decided that who is entirely unnatural in the meaning of being ready to be. And that having a future is part of what being human is about, and that we take away the future for humans, you take away the lives of humans. And that is not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present. That one near cast, Luke, comments to Bill. Living, turning, present. Bill drives and lots of the communities very good. to see what position Luka is holding your freedom. Luke looks outside passenger window and every once in a while, turns to go into the door. Longness. There's dead in. Touching Luke's room. Kaur is pulling onto entrance by men to find way. Luke sees what she is holding through the saw me on his. The earth's feet meet into the earth's Let's season self-absorbed sins in the story I can't read the truth or sin The universe that is in one sign of humanity He leans over the truth and Arthur man The universe that is in one sign of humanity He leans over the truth and Arthur man He leans over the truth and Arthur man I mean I'm injured. I'm in a fishing camp. Here we go. We met him, we put on all of them. We got a walk home, baby, guys, if just don't see it, be right. We parked a look at the city life, she's seen it. It really is a little bit of a sightseeing. I'm more than little closer to her. So I could see she's seen it. Oh no, dad, move away from me. For me. Well, we're in Stigar. This is a scugger from the service to the filmmaker. See, you ready to play house? My request. You can go to the right now. Can we do it right now? Determine. This one. I can do it. Right in the eye contact. That's right. It's a nice one. Okay. But some of you are a program so far, okay? Let's just review. It's just getting straight right now. It's not sure it's so far, but about people whose futures they're taking from them. They were thrown into the present and they were needed. I guess if you're interested in any emotional moment happens, you're thrown in the present and in a really aggressive, aggressive way. Whether you choose to or not, you have this sense of hyper, hyper-sense of reality. The next story is about some of these futures taken. him when he was long as imprisoned for 20 years and he sentenced his community two years ago and he found himself reborn into every day life. It was  I just, I don't see  I just didn't know that I mean the air is feeling a bit about that. Get enough cooking breakfast. making pancakes. It's a great thing to do stuff  that. It sounds great, really. , everybody thinks that it's really good. , that's really exciting. And that's the one thing I want to say. I want to say that. Very lovely. And I'm inside. I'm at. Inside. This is Ed Wider, he was a prison for murder. There's doing time in great, different places in prison. many. And a few years ago, a key witness who had testified against him admitted to Ryan while on the roof and an other evidence confirmed for a very famous murder film. In back when he was in great effort prison, he paid trumpet and he sang with the jazz band. And the whole time he dreamed of this new life and he knew life that he would have out saw as a professional musician. And that that's what he's working on. That's what is working on right now. and he doesn't have a CD after the he's pointed in the world. The first time I guess when I got out of this, I didn't so can tell to be so exact  I did. And I was just glad. And makes it. It was beautiful people. , they tell us something you did. And in prison you have a lot of, , you have a lot of musicians, . I mean, they have all musicians, they all make no money. I guess, but you fuck as a prison. But you have a lot of guys, you can use it. And  even though you might not be active playing  if they're quick to kill us , what's not right? What do you flatten in mind? whether you raise this thing you guys didn't play change Although it might not have took away some instructions to move the system. I guess you can say that Truth moves have a tendency to think  class transition everything has to be perfect , , you were all you didn't teach me. They don't discern themselves so much with that. As much as how are you anything, how are you helping us to see your family and about ourselves? How are you making us feel better? A great effort. It has nothing you should do to make you feel better, accept the release of yourself. So, as you can play with a gratif or a zeroing look for an plot, this long as they don't book. , whether if they can't find out the wrong thing, that's how you, , you just didn't turn right, , when you have to hold up, you didn't, you didn't hold it all off of what it's hard to agree, and I didn't look right, , so they'll find songs. And I haven't heard people earlier in the program talk about the importance of living in the pricing. But for me, if you're invited, if you're invited out there in prison, the most important thing is to keep your eye on the future. in the prison. Do you really dare it because the person is so stubborn. I think when I was in the same night I didn't know about this. In my head I just said a lot of, a lot of plans, a lot of things that I just didn't know about. I just didn't know about being the purpose. , you're so stubborn. You're too. You're not me. You have nothing else to look for to do. , you're asking, you're hoping to be hoping, you're trying to be a little bit easier. We asked him if he is still playing the same music. Now that his future is here and he's out. And we thought that maybe the songs that he used to play were just playing back his card. Memories of prison that he'd rather just assume avoid. But he said, no, he plays the same one, but he's now that he used to. Though sometimes they mean it's an indifferent to him. When I was in gradasward, I always... listen to. I had a tip of God blessed the child. He's got a normal being hard. And what it meant to me was that God is. And it has the same meaning now, but it's different. And it says that when I was at graduate store, when she said, , then this guy she did, he was not sure about the same, the same as me. Mama may have probably had the God blessed the child. He has his own. Well, in my mind, a graduate was, I thought that yes, I was the child and handsome because I was our human. and long hop at the time. There was a long hop. I see my moves. I was  a char. I was  a char. Because I had no one I can turn to my pants and pants. And pants and no one I can turn to. And I felt  every time I listened to that, I felt that she was talking to me. , if me, that meant that I was on my own in this prison situation. And I was gonna have to make it the best way without you. And I was gonna have to must all energy and life would work  you. , when I was released and I heard the same song again, it still had that needle but now it's a different, I'm on my own differently because I'm not in sesame. , that's not a struggle now. It's me, but I'm on my own now because I got things that have to do with this possibilities now. I'm going to have to take the others and have to take the job responsibility. Have a lot of the things , , to do these things. I don't have no fish in God. Wake me up in the mouth. Turn here. It's time to get up. It's time to go eat. , it's time to eat. You guys can go to shower. , I don't have them. I don't have them. I don't have them. So all this nail is depending upon me. And my own wish to. Then let's go. See you again. Then let's not go. So the Bible says, and is the end of me My name, my name, and it's God's blessing, God is God's name As Your wisdom, ye novice to the Devil while the week was fair empty parties don't they don't make green rickings popup paper got less chance Yeah it's not. He's over Money You've got lots of friends They all keep us hanging around You're done But when it's gone And all of us spend their days They don't come to rest They won't come to rest No, no, no Which wishes you Because the grade is such Go on and I help you say But you better not take too much mommy You inson 않아 Danger It's too And write it, which reading is in the pie class when the studio is at WH, by drawing for the diffuse, speaking to me and says it to do some means in that time. But write it to the bigum, because it taught it for nada, that was the way to use to nada, for me. So when we asked him to play a number with this one, what is happening? It's pretty much all the time we have for this evening's fun, if this program is provided by the John D and Catherine C. MacArthur. Foundation.

Chris Heinhook to step up with the Jango Rine Heart numbers on the show. You can hear her in just one hour here at WBEZ. Other people to thank because this is our first show. She will go away. He dunked come a bitch, tackling in Jenkins. Gloria, Chacha for raising the money. Now antlets were designing over the studio, billmires and album. next working overtime in this week of the studio to compete it. Sounds really pretty. Except for when a certain board operator named myself. Three signs playing at once. Card cutting him gave us a thousand little things. Jim Villecheck is the guy who installed our door today. I'm here grateful to him. Fun away and just given us lots of ongoing technical advice to our Melatia. As we go to the show from the start, we'll be back next week. Same time we hope from the BBE Chicago. Am I regardless? I wouldn't say that the prayer I will miss Tell me, what I ever met you"
