  "text": "So, I want you to explain to me everything you had to go through. where to see them again depends day. I had to get something. I had to get not only a cook but also juice from somewhere outside of the movie theater. Not open it up. I want to have it sealed. I have a strong, make a strong cover, read it. Had to sit on the other. Had to leave the theater during the previous. and then come back and just let us start. Had to wash my hands and come on time to of course, just so, you say, I'll bring my hands. Happens a lot in your monitors. Who's already scrubbed? I don't know that there are parts that have to watch from the rear. I just realized that it was going a little too far. That these rituals that I developed were still from the back of the house. I'm going to live as a shadow witness. American life in my class. Each week on our program which is the topic, in your variety of different kinds of stories, documentaries, radio, monologue, short stories, pound, hate, anything we can think of. Today's program, what happens? Then it would have idea becomes a compulsion. It happens when it starts to control you. Our program today in or acts for different stories and joining me for this hour is part to actually go to chat, there's a difference. There's a difference. of theaters, freaking out and spell out hatreds, pop top, and editor at Harper's Magazine in New York, and the contributing editor to our show as well. Paul has been thinking and talking to a lot of people about this subject of small obsessions and compulsion. Can I just say that you're stirring the movie theater? I mean, those are pretty small things. I mean, that is all this thing seems pretty innocent. They aren't. They aren't. I mean, none of them are really out of control. I guess I guess one of the reasons they're so good. sort of hit me is just because I've been thinking of this and what's struck me about it was that feeling where suddenly you think now this this could become a lot worse I mean there are people  okay this was before movie  there are people out there who are interested and what separates me from that couple hundred Thanks new and numeric. There's a numeric number week on the side of that difference but I have this feeling there and moving that  good half at any so Paul among the cavalcade of stories and blood and papers of the hour of session and some of them are serious and some of the more likely what he was start with one of the first people that I talk to is actually someone that I know really well and I just go for my day to kill him what I'm wanted to talk to her about was her obsession with the number two, which was a kid just  any kid. Favorite number, favorite call. Her favorite number was two. But it came out a lot, big. So I started being very proud to be doing things twice. For example, dropped a key. I would then lean down and pick them up. But before I actually picked them up, I would probably drop them again. I'm really close with the no one with right now and I'm very, but I'd be very aware that I was so I'm so into the beautiful obligation. Provisions weren't all consuming. They were some of the organs of the dinner table on our class. She says something you're trying to keep it fresh. Two. She made it on top first. There's columns there. She got her own feet. She started to see the whole world being flooded with these teeth. She's just working on the subject. Thanks a lot. No, I had a favorite color with blue and I also had the fancy that blue is basically these colors. So it all seems to sit in, right? But yellow seemed much more odd to me. It's red, you got brown, you even. Great, you got it. This is a bit resonated all with you. I can see blue being in it. Tell me a little bit more about the other associations too. you talked about, I think you told me once that these were well. Yeah, you are awesome. when they do even these. But , I don't  them as they are. I much prefer to say Thursday, which seem a lot. I mean, days are weird. Monday, Wednesday seems pretty easy. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, off in art. And so I see it totally different. You do? Yeah, I see Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays, and even Hollywood. I mean, Tuesday. first. E. Get the good for the next session. I think I'm going to say that again. Who wrote it? Where it's not just this? It's starting to really control A. And that's common because that's when people start to love us. Do  what Francis did? She not only had any other thing. Number two, she also had a deal with symmetry. People are symmetrical with each other. She would touch her left here, let's just touch her right. That's very easy. The big symmetry thing that I can remember is going to the Broadway show with my family. And I have this sense that I didn't feel quite right to just clap at my hand. Oh. I tell you the thing about coffee with my elbow. With this idea that   that would produce a more symmetrical mixture. I would craft with my hands and pop with my elbows, and then maybe even pop with  the entire hand handle. And  I can remember sitting there, wanting to make me insane. What are you doing with your elbow? I think you , , this is not normal. What I want to ask you about is the relationship between two other people and the others. And I just sort of remember that there were times when I would go ahead and where I would give a mad about the two. I mean, do you remember those times when I would get mad about the two? Yeah, but I always felt  you were irritation about it. It was just... rational means for example  you've to come up a lot with them. You have a word of clot, right? set my alarm clock usually for  802. If I need a word more sleep than at 812 or 822, I don't really  832 but I'll do that. , so when I used to want to set the alarm clock for 802 and you would check and want to set it, I mean first of all, some of those you would have checked, you would just want to set it for 803, which was just pure malice on your part. Obviously, I'm not going to be happy if it's, or I'm quite a separate 8 or 3. I mean, what would you really care if I set the alarm quite great, O2? I'm actually a member of that, and I would say it's not going to be a... I actually would watch you see, but no, it's not. Why? Because it is about , it's about  unnecessarily cluttering things. It's been an entire kind of stuff, but good good. We're about... Just told me this is so good. But there's only, you only think about it highly stuff. If it's something that you, that really feels an obligation. Which of the two things is a little different way, but it's also something that you  or that I . But that's not what that's, that's not what it's . What's the chance you would say? Oh, , 802 or you said, right? That's great. That's great. That's great. It was , if it was you, it was you. You give it to me. , if it wasn't just, you would put it, it's  a piece of cake in the house. It's not if I just, , have a last one. But you never just have to. , you had never just happened to set it for a night of life. You would set it and there would be , , something very sinister about you're setting the alarm clock. I'm trying to get you. Right, right, right. So, what we do? You didn't really do it. I mean, there is a way in which I'm addicted to two things and in a way that's kind of almost as powerful as any other physical addiction. I love this song. No, I think that I actually kind of  it. I don't think I  having that kind of order at that much. I think you're teased. When you would drop a piece and fuck it. Yeah. You do that. Quite. Love people with things. Yeah. Well, I mean, , I was glued in enough to know that people would take it become weird. , average Joe is not going to be that sympathetic to someone's business, especially with them too. But although I do think, , the boy talks to people. I do think he'll have their Asians. No, he talks about his about it. they continue. And on the one side of the continuum would be the people who might just labels working together, other people who would have to take a closer. And I think, yeah, I think most people are on the continuum. And in some sort of most people are on the continuum. but that doesn't explain why one can't explain this. They're , Joey, would end up with such an extreme sound  use of practice and someone else ended up. Do you, why do you think that she and that at the point which isn't? Well, we talked about a lot of that. I don't know what's really key about the deafening answer. The more thing I kept thinking about though is that to me of sessions, can sometimes take place. It was not said. The loudness religion gives you certain rules, or rituals , or I would choose to in your life. Things would be ordered to form their rules. And if you grow up in it, non-religious environments, maybe start creating these forms, you grow up in creating a sense of freedom. Yes. So do you think maybe people who grow up in that sense can have good or wrong said rituals? Was- or hyper-rational. Right. There's no religion. There's two psychologists parents, both basically with every figure that. But  both you and your family, your siblings too. I have kind of this tendency. That's cool, right? But  what? I don't, that's my trouble. We really confused. , I could imagine that a physics sub, is really... and it keeps the thing. What about Elena? Rob Bance. What do  about Elena the relevant? No, she won the group answer for her. That's my day. And do  why she worried about him? No. I don't know either. I think she worried about him. And she worried. She worried a lot of her events. She didn't just remember either. I'm sure she would be very bad. She would be very bad. She would be very bad. She had less than her family. I think she also  him. I hate people that they're a pocket. That's a part of that. That's a part of that. That's a part of that. I mean, , I really, I don't actually think, I think if you go into any health, so you'll find me because, ,  my mother used to say that having worked kids and this right here is a normal, with a normal kid in town. Okay. Suppose the way that you can walk gathered, another few stories, or a obsession. The next one is a little bit further down that continued, this is one with somewhat more serious consonants. There won't be too much to do Just smile when I feel There is not much left of me Watch you get as much as you say There's a word being a word I leave it up to me Actual From there what? I read the secret bits. I think a little scary about these questions. Even even the ones that are pretty in some  jump. Is that feel, we got that something is just drawn. And so let me think that you could just suddenly go on the end. Just because you are drawn. There's a sense that something else is writing on this. So explain what you got first notes. Well, this is a story. of someone who did go for a while. It's by one named Lauren Slater, who was a psychologist, boss. This is a neckserk from a book that's going to be published, which is 10 of the title Black Swans. But one thing is really interesting to me about Lauren, especially after having talked to Julia, that they started the same place. As a child, Lauren did a lot of the same thing, so that Julia did a lot of the same. superstitious beliefs, fears, how much you walk through a door and tap a frame three times, which is set of prayers back between each prayer , she fudge had a closer eye than can't ten had. But at some point, he would further. There is something satisfying and scary about making an angel, lowering your bulk and body into the drowning block, straight blanks landing on your face. I am 7 or 8, Ms. God means above me, Grand Death. I moved my arms and legs, expanding, contracting, sculpting snow report and swallow me up. I register a mistake on my angel, but it looks  a thumbprint on its left wing. I reach down to her racet, but I am unable to smooth the snow perfectly, so I start again on another angel, lowering myself, swishing and sweeping, rolling over. No, yet another mistake. This time the symmetry in the wing span is wrong. A compulsion comes over me. I do it again and again. In my memory hours go by. My fingers inside my mittens get wrinkled and raw. My breath comes heavily in the snow begins to bloom. A moon rises, a perfect crescent pearl whose size shape I will never be able to recreate. I ate for something I cannot name. Someone calls me, come in now, come in now. Very early the next morning I awakened, look out my bedroom window, and see the yard covered with my printed forms. Hundreds of angels none of them quite right. The forms twist and strain. The wings seem to struggle up in the winter sun, as if each angel or longing for a escape. for a free flight at my crack at Crystal and Ice of Earth still, stiff world. Looking back on it now, I think maybe those moments in the snow were when my OCD began, although it didn't come to me full-fledged until my mid-20s. OCD stands for obsessive and pulse of sorter, in some studies say over 3 million Americans suffer from it. Some mental health professionals plain that the onset of obsession is a response to an underlying fear, a recent promise say or a loss. I don't believe that that is always true, because no matter how hard I think about it, I remember nothing unusual or disorienting before my first attack. I don't know exactly why it to a clock one Saturday afternoon, what felt  a seizure shook me. I recall lying on the floor in my apartment in Cambridge. I was immersed in a book, this Saturday strongly. a boring mountain, walking my way through the tail's church, among the moan. And suddenly this, a thought for reigning across my cortex, I can't concentrate. Of course the thought disturbed my concentration, and the monks moan turned into a whisper, disappeared. I blinked, looked up from the book, the floor suddenly frightened me, between the plain and the monks I could see lines of darkness in the sway of the spider crawling. Let me get back, I thought, into the world of the book. I lowered my eyes to the page, but instead of being able to see the print, there was the thought blocking out all else. I can't concentrate. Now I started to panic. Each time I tried to get back to the book, the words, crumble, lost their shapes. I said to myself, I must not allow that thought about concentration to come into my mind anymore. But of course, the more I tried to suppress it, the louder it jangle. I looked at my hand, I ached for its familiar skin, but as I held it out, sentenced, I can't concentrate on my hand, blocked out my hand, so all I saw was a blur of flesh. I tried to force my brain onto other topics, but with each mental dodge I became aware that I was dodging. And each time I itched I became aware that I was itching. And with each inhalation I became aware that I was inhaling. And I thought, if I think too much about breathing, well I forget how to breathe. Say, God, I'm sorry, 14 times I ordered myself. This is crazy, I said to myself, 15 times, a voice from somewhere else commanded. In the days after my attack, a cess of thoughts return. But before then in consequence. behavior is  counting to three before I went through a doorway or checking the stove several times before bed. Now became imperatives. There were a thousand in one of them to follow. Rules about how to step what it meant to touch my mouth. A hot and suing urge to fix the crooked angles of the universe. It was constant, a cruel mattering. There, that tilted picture on the wall. Scratch your head with your left hand only. It was noise. The beak of a woodpecker in a soft part. my brain. I did very little for the next year. I didn't want to go out because any movement might set off a cycle of obsessions. I sat hunched and lost weight. Fearing brief prevented me from eating much. When I was too terrified to get out of bed, I checked into the local hospital where I lay amidst IV drips, bags of blood, murmuring, heart machines that let me know someone somewhere near will still alive. Then one day my doctor said to me, there's a new medication called Prozac, still in its trial period, but it's 70% effective with OCD. I want to send you to a doctor who could pick, he's one of the physicians doing trial runs. I shrugged, willing to try. I tried so much, surely this couldn't hurt. I didn't expect much though. I certainly didn't expect what I finally got. Cats of Paper on Vicky Vicks desk are all edged and green and white with the word Pros X-Crip to the cross-the-bottom. The pen has Pros X in Boston tiny letters. He asks me about my symptoms for a few minutes and then uses the Pros X pen to write out of prescription. After a couple of days of nausea and headaches, the Pros X began to work its magic. One morning I woke up and waited for a command. Touch your nose, please. 12 times, trying not to think about concentrating. The imperative scheme, I could hear them, but from far away,  birds beyond the mountain, the sound nearly silent and easy to ignore. By the fourth day I felt so shockingly fine that I called Dr. Rukidik, I believed he had saved me. I'm well-italled in. Not yet, it takes at least a month to build up a therapeutic flood level. No, I said it doesn't. I felt... the Russian joy, the medicine you gave me has made me well, has actually never felt better. The pause on the line. I suppose it could be possible. Yes, I said, it's happened. Coming up, the chemistry of obsession. Prozek stops working for our insider, a beat it catching, and more in a pub. in the beginning. A little sad with a little funk but feeling pulled in before and when it got spinning I can do it right now. To some American life, Marick Glass and co-hosting with me for this hour is part of one of our contributing editors and he has assembled a number of stories about obsession. And right now we're in the middle of a story by Lawrence Slater and she found herself seized by her sessions, hearing voices, parallel laughter. And then nearly overnight she found herself cured by a prosik. How could a drug change my mind so abruptly? My brain wasn't. wet plain taste, because all good branched deep, but a glinting thing crossed with wires. I wasn't human but machine. No, I wasn't machine but animal. Blink to my electric ride by all of the more completely than I could imagine. We have come to think lately of machines and animals. Of machines in nature is occupying opposite sides of the spectrum. There is IBM and then there's the lake. But really, they are so similar. A computer goes on when you can... it's button. A gazelle goes on when it sees a length. Only humans are supposedly different, above the pure cause and effect of the hard-wired primitive world. Free will and all. But no, maybe not. Pride swallowed a pill to the onto technology. In doing so, I was discovering myself embedded in an animal world. I was a purely chemical being, mood in personality, seeping through serotonin. We are... I'll talk to believe it's true, but how strange to feel that supposed truth bubbling right in your own weak brain feel. Mornings now, I got up early to job, shower efficiently, and strode up to the library. I was able to go back to work, cutting deli part-time at Vermaugios, while I prepared myself for divinity school next year by reading. I read with an appetite, hungry from all the time my lost illness. The pages of the book seemed very white. words were easy, black-each shining, Ebony and my quieted mind. Then one day, as though I'd never swallowed a pro-zec pill, my mind seized and clamped in the obsession for that, I was staying with a family and opalash and Kentucky on an oral history project. During my interview with Kat, the mother, I decided to take a break in the sand of Yard. It was almost 100 degrees, she can scream in packed, and one swift and seamless move, hats has been long reached down to grab a bird. He laid it down on a stump, raised an axe, and cut. The body did its stance, blood spilled. I ran inside, took a step forward, and then said to myself, don't take another step until you count to 25. I'd satisfy that imperative. I had to count 25 again and then have 25 and then quarter it before I felt safe enough to walk out the door. By the end of the day each step took over 10 minutes to complete. I stopped taking steps. I sat on my bed. What's wrong with me cat said come out here and talk with us. I tried but I got stuck in the doorway. There was a point above the doorway I just had to see and then see again. And inside of me something springed back again, back again. The next morning, a Sunday, cat told me, \"...they'll feel better if he come to church with us. She peered into my face, which must have been white and wrong. Are you suffering from some city sickness?\" The next morning, a day of the night, a day of the night, a day of the night. Come to church. Pat said, we can ask the preacher to pray for you. But I didn't believe in prayers where my illness was concerned. I'd come to think that whatever was wrong with me had a simplistic chemical cost. I woke late one night, fists clenched. It took me an hour to get out of bed so many numbers I had to do, but I was determined. And then I was walking outside, pushing past the knee. to count before every step. I passed midnight field to single shack with lighted windows, housed slept in the pasture. I rounded the pasture, walked up the hill, and then before me, spreading out in moonlight, awake. I stood by its lip. My mind was buzzing and jerking. I don't know at what point the swans appeared. White swans, they must have been, but in silhouette they look flat. Brass Cłązicom 어쨜 Alright look at it in Low nombre Love and they seemed to materialize straight out of the water. They rose to the surface as memories rise to the surface of consciousness. Hundreds of black swans suddenly floating absolutely silent, and as I stood there, the counting ceased. I mind became silent and I walked. The swans drifted until it seemed for a few moments that they were inside of me. Seven dark, silent birds, fourteen princesses, single self-swimming in a tapid sea. I don't know how long I stood there, or when exactly I left. This warmth disappeared eventually, accounting, ticking, talking of my mind resumed. Still, even in chattering illness, I've been quieted for a bit. Gorsenie had opened. elegance had entered. This.call me. I was not completely claimed by illness nor was I a prisoner of Prozac entirely dependent on medication to function. Part of me was still free. Private space, not absolutely permeated by pain. A space I could learn to cultivate. It is a small space and I would have wished for myself. Even after I raised my dose, the Zek never worked as well as it once had. In years later, I am sometimes sad about that, other times strangely relieved, even though my brain has hounded. I still must check my keys, still, I must pause many times while I write this and do a ritual count to 30. It's distracting to say the least, but still I write this, I can walk and talk and play. I've come to live my life in those brief stretches of silence that arrived throughout the day. I'm learning something about a single moment. How right with the tension it is. How truly loud it's tick. We're in Slater's psychologist in Little Boston. This story is accepted from the approval of BlackSquart. And also, probably you guys are going to publish this in purpose. It's a pin. That's fine. It's quite sad to say that we're welcome to my country. I'll just miss you at that end. I don't know whether it's a And I can find it, but never Yeah Don't get it back Don't get it back But you wanna break that Don't get it back Now I don't know what's e-Sings going on Vai, Vai, Vai! Let's reset and I love it When I lose confidence started I zamaned In my activates I'm about to start your本 I'm never getting back I'm getting back Act 8. Talk, talk, talk about. Thank you, I'm Paul. I'm one of the contributing editors to our program, also a writer and a senior editor at Carperson Magazine. Each of our program of course, we choose a theme and do a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme and Paul, you have been gathering the stories for this week's show. And the theme is, because we're just tuning in. We're talking about obsession. Compulsions and rituals. See, it kind of a meta obsession, so we're going to obsession with obsessions. Okay, exactly. the obsessed Muslims. we split the purposes of this hour. And as we've been putting this show together of the last year, you've been saying that these kinds of proposals that are hearing that share a lot with religion. Yeah, I think there are certain similarities. And I think that just has religions can help people with my order, care on a world. Some of these rituals that we create in ourselves to the tips ofalgia. This reminds me of something that I've earned in Hebrews as a kid. Here we go. This music is always playing in the house of Chah-Fah. That in the Staddle and Baltimore. This class has all pretty much. Anyway, what it reminded me of is this thing that I've earned that in traditional Judaism. And you're still see very religious Jews do this. Then in that kind of duties, I merely every act of human life is accompanied by some kind of ritual or thanks to God or prayer, including putting on clothes, washing your hands, using the bathroom, strict rules about what you can eat and how you eat it. , the pressure box, grossing and coming to the head, we just do kisses to the mrs and the door frames and the homes, enters and leaves the room. Plus, how's your prayers in Blessings? If we hear lightning, these blessings from that. If they see thunder, who's the blessing of that? If we hear bad news during the day, and who's the blessing of the truth, Josh. If we hear good news, any of what type of good news we might say, Asia, Hachiyano, this is my or silver. 35 years old, probably three. Remember, the Hibod has civic community here in Chicago. He's a irrigator from the local district council of the IRS. There was gracious enough to come in and talk to me about similarities and differences between the hundred rituals that he does as we're just every day. And the more secular rituals that you can talk about, you've been a view of having talking about all of the SDRs at heart. And when he came in, I described a bunch of these kind of daily compulsive rituals to him. Jillian's having to do things in twos, , dropping their car keys and then having dropping sari into the car. But Warren Slater is having to count 30 of me now and then push him to allow us up to move forward in any task. And my or so we're said, really he only sees one similarity between what they're doing and what he does. I know he's saying that it's just the capability to be developed something. I think maybe we should go out in differences there. And I guess it sounds  the way you describe him. maybe wrong. That these people are imprisoned by certain actions. I don't feel imprisoned. I don't feel held. Saying, oh, I can't be in a car from sundown and bloody sundown. Saturday, I look at this video. One interesting of difference between my... higher and the people who we've heard about Safar's program is it when Maya goes to his daily rituals, but any groups go through daily rituals. We can next to its addition to Diabotes, to Rha, to his family, to his people. Whereas the people who we've heard in the show up from now when they go through the day with their very excessive. It doesn't connect them to anyone else. The path is just a lot more wrong, right? Do  that the key is here that something bad would happen to you? I would say that I knew to be honest, what's the bad thing about that? What's the bad thing that you can have? I guess maybe it's the fear of not knowing. Fear of not belonging to sort of  this abandoned. Maybe if my abandonment got abandoned me. And I would be alone. I'd be responsible for myself. So give it a . Go and do the things that God wants. God is with you. , I don't think that I can actually be in a minor as is described in a sense of enjoying it. I think there are a lot of similarities between how they see their minds. I think that especially when you were talking about that is fierce, , I think that Jolens is the same way. It's not that she's terrified of her two. She's not afraid of the wrath of two. He's not afraid of the rap, but I mean, down, he doesn't obey the command, but I think if she goes, it's kind of a dangerous wall, that helps to have something for her son. For her case, that number two, I think if just , he said that he feels her own separate. Just , off. In the same way, I think she'll even be a good listener too. He had four, two out of the sessions. Now, I wrote one thing about the way that we judge sessions, how successful. I'm going to take my joy in every way he's completely successful. One thing, two, what we considered being able to help you, to agree. He wasn't such a good person, he was just lacking that he is a... to carry the team on the back of the East, actually. It's not the only way to surpass. Right, exactly. If the story of obsession can be subsumed in a larger story of heroism and glory, then the obsession will be even his attention to it. Right. Well, this leads us to our next two stories here on our show. This is the work of two people who've immersed themselves in their own particular of sessions and people at home can judge themselves with pleasure. With what results, this first piece of work is... one of the stranger things he had to say. He was going to show. I'm in great white head, he's been collecting the sound of people screaming and it thoughts about the meaning of different kinds of screams. For years, all over the world, he sets up these special, colonized people in front of his set up of, I think, the Institute of Scream Studies. The screams, often treated as some kind of insurmountable, impenetrable obstacle pure. white noise force that is beyond Analysis and I'm worthy of any kind of interpretation But here at the institute Here the screen from entirely the other perspective the screen isn't opening There's an entry point doesn't access point and entry into a vast interior landscape that has hasn't surface this highly nuanced, very individual psychoacoustic force to. There is also a screen line, the actual journey that the screen takes into interior landscape. And we established the teleconference and machine that the instrument called the screen line, because that machine was going to circulate. individual screenwands into Thank you Mr. Whitehead. I've been leaves you around the wrong text. I'm sure if you came to my house, you and him, going to never want to hear again. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, I'm Leena Degen, I'm her kiddo and he's mesquite. bank card or each door and use last screen. ...Byeee!! The screen. Hi, kind of early in the morning to scrape. I don't think I'll scrape but I'm going to tell you a story. I was thinking about how scrape sometimes come later, much later,  a kind of late, yeah. And so this is a true story that happened when we go when I was a teenager. And I was on the string. I could run away, I think, but this is all I had. We were on the string. and we could go for days, night, and it has got really steamy and the strain. It's got a CD, it's been , what was this? Thank God, all the time, thank God, smoking. And it suddenly, just  broke out,  I know it, with kind of thirst, which would just be so awesome. It was  really, really soft foam, and body is kind of colliding. Ricochanged, currador, stuff. And, and, and then then then... and we pulled the door out of the apartment and the body had a roll over, a roll past, and it was blood, snowed, all over the glass. You couldn't see anything because of that, it's  the sun and the vision and the vision of the front. But it took quite a while as an hour before we reached in the evening. It took a couple of days to finish it. But when the vision got over the train stopped, and there was a scene called the location  a tulip silent. who had extraordinary nothing, no one seemed to speak and it wasn't incredibly hot and hazy and they were just a desert all around and they took the body off the train and then the guy he took it off with him, got some these kind of few props they had from nowhere and it was just  a platform in the middle of nowhere and in suddenly  out of the silence green k i had to fly something between a whale and a screen And it's  it just went right through the whole kind of landscape. And it's  the dust settled in the air as the screen kind of chur-hung there. I just seem  for ages. I wonder if I can do that screen. I can hear it really, really clearly. I'll try but I think it won't be  that. Anyway, something  this. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That companion of screams from Greg Whitehead of the Institute of Scream Studies. He invites your screams and your thoughts about screams. And we get to get there enough of this from around the country. He's going to put together a second companion of the screams for some later show that will play. It's a little radio experiment. Here is the phone number to call. 312832-3326 again 3128 three, two, three, two, six. We're serious about this. Call, scream, and talk about screams. And call well, well, people are dialing. Well, the next person I talk to is the artist's and he and his name is Liza. And she is another obsessed person who has a heroic character. So he, for five years, she had a ritual but she did every day. She would get on your dress. get ready to go about her day and then sit down at her studio with tweezers and white glue and tens of thousands hanging low beams. She was bent the whole day gluing them down into patterns and then the end of five years she created this amazing book on. I haven't had much luck describing this work. What does that mean? A beaded kitchen. You imagine a beaded skirt on a beaded top. This is the best I can do as I can say. This is a three-dimensional room. It's 200 square feet. It's painted, but it's painted with beads that you have to apply with tweezers one at a time. So it's this amazing amount of color. It's some pinks, blues, and silvers, and golds. That imagine a wood grain counter in your kitchen. Only suddenly, instead of brown wood, it's become golden and yellow, and it's burnt copper. There's a table in milk, right? Beat it, take a look. On the table are quite a panches, speed it, cereal box, speed, toast, bacon, and newspaper. All the beat. Behind the table there are beat covers, beat it, fritz, cook, stove. Every surface is covered with tens of thousands of beats. Free effects for thunder and above. The whole place seems  it's plugged in, just shy. Nothing's bad. It's even a beat-it-dust man, for this film's beat-it-dust. The thing about obsession is you never know where it's going to be. One minute or just a regular person collecting autographs of same string, try and keep playing. And then something just overtakes you. For lies that I think for a lot of people you reach a point where something that's much fun. It's a job to do. I didn't think about it. I thought it would take that since it's not to do when I started. I didn't think it would take so much. I didn't realise it would take my life. I didn't realise that when you, it's  calling in love maybe it's a form of where you watch your life, you watch everything else. Follow. all the way, he lose everything in a sense. Five years, I was in the constant stage of to-doless of stress, pressure, and always been a failure because every day you feel so you've got nothing done, you maybe get five inches of work done, , five inches of an entirely-beaded kitchen. So you really suck right. It's been a long time. Every day. This is a personal problem. , yeah, I always feel  I didn't get enough done. I never had the feeling of, wow, did I just really do well today. Maybe I'll work 18 hour a day, and then maybe, , I'll continue to do that for two weeks. So, how much time did that take? I don't clock in. How many days is this fine? years to do it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how much cost me to do it. I don't know. If I knew those answers, I wouldn't do it. Nobody who thinks  that would be a kitchen. The wallpalt is really challenging because the curiosity is the thing that motivates me. Nah, I'm not patient. I'm curious. I already knew once I had done one wall panel, I knew what it was going to look , then I had to do nine more, , eight more panels and then they all get together. And that was really difficult. I would wonder, can I say to Preston, then finally I stood the whole wall up and he wasn't a god, he wanted to be a good person, doing the same pattern for the last three months. She didn't have any grants or patrons in she was working on the kitchen. So to make ends meet, you'd have to sell pieces. for time. And of course the pieces that she saw would be be there. They would be pieces from the kitchen. Well, actually she says that she's probably sold the equivalent of the kitchen. There doesn't need another entire kitchen out there in various peoples homes. So she'd have to be there to buy the beads. It's one step backward and then another step forward hopefully. Hopefully we'll buy two months in the studio. One... sale or two sales. And that problem with my work is that it takes so long. So selling a soup can wouldn't just set me back a day, it's set me back maybe several weeks. For a long time, I felt really, I resented how hard it was. This stood seem right. I mean, nobody who works at IMAGNAN has to work at IMAGNAN in order to then work at IMAGNAN. Do  what I mean? She's living in LA at the school, and there was her. That's almost destroying the building. I got to Sponkall in the middle of the night. I was a home apartment. Basically they were locking the studio out where you would lose everything. They did this to doctors offices. They lost other files. Because once the building is condemned, they lock it out and you can't get back in. So there was this great moment where I didn't know if I was going to lose three years of work. I didn't know if I was going to lose. And if I had lost it, if I had, I think I got locked out. I wondered what I would do again. What I would make that table again. But thankfully, I had time for two hours to get everything. And I had a bunch of friends came and we just shoved everything. And this work is so fragile. I can't imagine doing this in two hours. But we got everything in the truck. And I ended up moving to Southern Cal, even further south. the San Diego. So, did you ever answer that question? For yourself, what you, what you would have done is just try. That I didn't have to answer that question. King is people think I'm patient, and I'm not patient, I'm just thinking. But I'm very, very curious, just point of death of curious. I wanted to know what it would look  to be a table. That's it! that's what got through it. It's the same patterns. So we're in blue pattern again and again again again. But what kept me is the same, the interest, what will it look  when it's finished? So if I had lost the piece and I knew what it took to do the piece and I already knew what it looked , why would it do again? What would be the motivating factor with that bead effect? So you could see it? I'm not sure if that's a motivates thing. I'm not sure if you approval of anyone else's motivates. If I had known that there would be those kind of sacrifices I probably wouldn't have done it. But as it came up, as you cross that road, you decide if you're going to jump over and if you're going to retreat. And every time I found that I would jump over. Life is so... So much chaos. I think that one. on the great solutions to dealing with that chaos to have the mission, to have some kind of purpose. That's sort of the way I deal with, with why I'm here, is to make every square inch something, something meaningful. My materials happened to speak of that because they are so slow and painstaking. And I have all this time to think about purpose and why am I doing this? And is this a meaningful thing you'll be doing? Everything has meaning. Let's listen. the classical music of my work. Absolutely everything has needed. You should give it to me. I had this in my studio and also I live in my... It's a lot. I was having something prepared. The camera came inside and speaks to my washer dryer. He looked at my kitchen and it was almost finished. It's absolutely what you're looking at just about maybe minus a Tyler. He said, put his hands on him to say, neat hobby. Last of his kitchen is currently on display in the museum, in the atmosphere. She's working on a, he did backyard, including I'm no one, he did, blades of grass. He said, Welcome to the channel.
