  "text": "So Lu and Johnson was a teacher. She wrote a book about her job. She sold that book to Havana. Before long, the book was made to a movie of Dangerous Mons. Now it's also a TV show, also called Dangerous Mons. And now every week Lu and Johnson returned on the TV and she had a teacher with her same name. March around and do things she thinks are unethical and advisable and sometimes just plain silly. holding a school fundraiser and a strip club. Number one, there's no teacher I know who would do such a thing. It's a legal. I think it lose your job and I would hope you would lose your job. But I just objected to that and I would never do it. Welcome to VB EZCH COGLE TO SMARCHING LIFE MY REGlass. Today at our program deals with the devil. As we do every week we invited a variety of writers and performers onto the show with their stories at this week all stories bet selling your soul to keep asking for bargains. In a program today, Act 1, Dangerous Minds Act 2, Act 2 is actually found in a Satan's own telemarketer, Act 3, Voyager, Act 4, Harmon becomes Files, Act 5, First Contact, let's see what it is. Act 1, Dangerous Minds First of them, a word about Luian Chocson's book. the one that they adapted very freely into the movie and TV show Dangerous Mind. It was called my possey don't do homework. The arrangements taught in the public schools and she says a country to what you may see on the evening news. It was not a war song. Yeah, that's one of the reasons I wrote that book design felt  people were just writing up kids. , 13 or 14 years old saying, well, there's hopeless, there's useless thing you can do. All the things I was reading then, when I was horrible they are and then I was factory people and you don't care and you're untie-tie-ball and I just don't feel- that's true, I think that's really not interesting. Well, Glenn Johnson's deal with the devil, preceded in several stages. First of all, we've started in shelf life room. About two years ago, I think three years ago. And Glenn Johnson did  something special. The primary lesson I always try to teach in my students is, you choose who you want. You can throw up your hands and line everyone in the world and say, I can't earn a name. can't do this. I have to do that. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to come to school. You choose to be here. Now you can choose to learn. You can choose to meditate. I think that came across in the movie. There is hope that you're not a victim. Man, you don't understand nothing. You don't come from where we live. You're not bus tier. Do you have a choice to get on that bus? Man, you come and live in my neighborhood for one week. And then you'll tell me if you got a choice. There are a lot of people who live in your neighborhood who choose not to get on that bus. People who choose. to get on that bus, which are you, are the people who are saying, I will not carry myself down to die when I go to migrate. My head will be high. That is a choice. There are no victims in this classroom. But the movie to some liberties with foreign jobs is a good one. For instance, filmmakers made her mixed race class into an all minority class. filmmakers invented fictional black parents who did not want the kids to learn. filmmaker's organized film around two stories which did not happen in real life. In one, who and Johnson get so overwhelmed by how impossible it is to make progress. But after just a few months, she decides to quit. And the other, the student is shot and killed. And she feels that these things reinforce the very stereotypes that she was trying to dispel by writing her book in the first place. And I think the movie really promotes racial tension by constantly hitting black against why having killed. call me white bread which never happened. It didn't happen. And I said to them why they do that. And this will be found in hard to believe that a classroom of black or Hispanic kids would welcome a white teacher and give her a new respect. And I said, but it's not a matter of your skin color, it's a matter of how you treat them. But they couldn't believe that. Then they still don't. And I think there are a lot of people who do believe that you can't walk into a classroom filled with minority kids and they're going to treat you around this time to deal with them. What would Hollywood? and Hollywood took other terms. The new printing of the book might pass you don't do homework in half. And when I got the mail I opened it up and it said dangerous mines. As the title it said dangerous mines. Yeah, said dangerous mines and it had the moving poster on it and it said by the round of the line, I didn't write a book called Dangerous Mines. How can they do this? So I called my editor and I said how can you do this? What? How can you change this detail of my book without a... I've been telling me she said it's not you. I'm not. You wrote, you got me. Not long after that, executives. Executive somewhere in America decided to exercise the cause and the low contract she had done. And her deal took this term. Someone called me and said, did you hear? I heard they were making TV show. They were both in the same home. No way. How else interesting? So I called my agey, Los Angeles, and said, making TV series, I would  to consult because I don't want them to do what they did with the movie. It's a far removed reality. , really  more something you do this to you. So she all back later and said, no, they said they don't need to. They want you. They can't afford to. She said, what do you mean? I know I'm a lot cheaper than those home. That's right. So, come back. That's apparently, yeah, I mean they haven't heard about educational sours. Right. America. And then, , there was some discussion between her and them. And the fact I asked when I produced her, so how much did the pain writers? I said I heard you pain in $50,000 each for episodes. And I said, oh, no, we're on the pain 30,000. Plus per... Per episode. And I was, we asked them to pay 25.1 for you. And they said, well, we'll see, probably not. Again, there are things about the TV series that Llan Johnson lives. She likes the especially the PICD in your case way that any PICD plays her, for example. But she also finds plenty that makes her uncomfortable. that episode with the student stage, the fundraiser. and strip club. They hold something called a hair war. Oh, my! What? What is a hair war? It's kind of  a fast-soluble hair. You try to tell me your people will come and lay down good money to watch us get our hair come. What are you being in the comb? I'm going to say I show you if you want to run around here. I just  all the producers. And, and Schneider and I said, and you're in bed. I said about this, you see what's your problem. And I said, , where do I start? Would you ? If you, if you're 14 year old at 15 year old daughter, if you're more from school, you found that in addition to taking her to strip club? And you didn't answer that. Go ahead, Johnson. The real one. Not the TV one. She's trying to raise millions of dollars to start new school these days. And having a separate trade on national television this way, every week she feels, is not going to help her credit for it. The idea, , they did the hair war. She raised funds within the center of the fight with a school board and they're looking down for this hit, running away from the program. These are two involved here in political fights  that. among adults is inappropriate, it is not a question for David, but I wouldn't do such something to find him. So, and he said, well, I think it's cute. And I said, well, I'll tell you what, I'm not cute, and my students don't think I am. I'm , how do these programs English teachers? The land Johnson. Well, I've seen it the hair work episode, has Loyen Johnson on stage in the script club, modeling big-out-rich's hair go. The police chair. Here he is. I will call you again. I'm cheating. made a deal with the devil. It was a devil whose intentions and works seem particularly benign. Well, me. The producers of dangerous minds are Andy Schneider and Diane Froglov before this project they produce the offbeat program Northern Exposure five years. They worked together so closely for so long they eventually finished each other's sentences. They'd be asked them with a try to accomplish in dangerous minds to go out remarkably similar to the ones that Luian Johnson had. She wrote her books. To give voice to a lot of kids that don't have a voice in television. We set out, we wanted to make people feel that these kids were their own kids. That's the point of the show. These kids who come for who we think of as at-risk kids, kids who come often from broken homes or from poverty, that they are not just statistics or something to be feared as the elements of crime, but they're just kids  everybody else. They're us. Those are the producers do not have a lot of personal experience these kinds of teenagers. to get the story lines and salt and work with teens  this. Teacher's Social Workers, Youth Gang Services Counselor, David Books. They got the idea for the hair worship, the story of that hair wards in the Wall Street Journal. And they described Goi and Johnson's phone caught in that. And that'd be it. So this way. She felt it in the end when she participated in the hair wars. That she looked silly and are feeling as well. That might be the case, but for in terms of creating a story and an arc in a story and giving a satisfying conclusion, she had read the story and the acquisition of the screen. Can you really tell anytime there is a story about a dream that someone would pretend to keep showing that I could focus on most models of how our films would be. We could have wanted a goodūt to be read and the story is атели 흌 loyal easthors, but the attractive coach was particularly new to my dad. I think it was even worse than what I said to reflecting her hair. It really helped the story to have her participate in it. And we felt as writers that that was endearing and something that was positive and really lovable about her that she would participate in the cops. The real-name in Johnson also had problems in the early program, where black character trains to kill TV mischance because she's encouraging his girlfriend to go to college. And I said, this is so wrong. There are black males who aren't trying to kill people. Why do you have to constantly present them as a violent? You can drop out of this. school, even, and still not be a criminal. And I really resent that because nobody ever threatened me. , this is totally unrealistic to think that some black girls' boyfriend is going to come and shoot the teacher because she's trying to tell the girl that a college. Producer's anti-sniper and Diane Frolov said that although Lulean Johnson herself was never threatened, other teachers in her situation certainly happened. Well, they don't recall talking to Lulean Johnson about this particular episode of show that don't view the scene the same way she does. The conflict was not so much. about the fact that she was going to college, but that he was losing control of her. And that dynamic sort of happened, , we were white people or anybody. Then one of the things I said to him, I probably had been sending, but I said, I'm not trying to think, but I really believe that one of the problems this group of writers are having with presenting black and Hispanic males, actually, that you don't know when you do have no drawn or so to food . You've never been to a house. I don't know. Where are we supposed to list our friends and that sort of thing in our defense? The process of writing is always a process of research. Diana and I wrote, in order to expose her five years, we didn't know any of her last words. We didn't know any Native American, but the process of writing and getting into the world is a process of researching that and coming in the contact with us. those people that you're trying to write about. We're not doing this really nearly. And again, I don't think we should have a demographic, but our staff is largely minority. Are writing that. And they're also former teachers on our staff. And then mentors and counselors  that. What do you think the overall message of the TV series here is? Who did it so a war zone? So it's a liberal message. the TV show is exactly the exact opposite kind of thing you try to do with the post. Yeah, yeah. It's not a new story. It's the same old story, which isn't true. It never happened. Well, we hope that's not the message of our TV series. We feel that the message of the series is open. Yes, and that people can make a difference in the lives of other people. That these are kids, and they're... as we said before, there are kids see. It's very disappointing to hear that. The war zone aspect of life in school is something that we will concentrate on more, but only because you need conflict, you need dramatic situations, you need stakes to be high. Otherwise, I'm not sure how you make the show, what's the, I mean, you have to deal with us? with the issues that have impact. In a sense, this is the fascinating bargain that producers contain her smarts. A high school in their show has more words on them, or her out attempts by teachers to save goods, more crises and near crises than any real university high school. There's a need three stories per episode, and they have to be transparent. At this point, Wayne Johnson says that she's refusing the fascinating bargain operative by Hollywood. She has no contractions. TV series. They send her checks. She sends them back on cash. Chis, if she had it all to do over again, she wouldn't have let anybody film TV series. Oh, she didn't swear to herself. She's helping the studio that produces dangerous songs. It's Disney. She changed the way the picture. Didn't need some house seems to believe that they own the young Johnson the way they own the Johnson Bumble. And that they can take this character and make her do what they want and say anything, whatever experiences they want them have to do. I maintain a mad character.

And if we can add preguntas in brainstorm. and a theme. And here in Chicago, where we do the show, we have seen his state, a castle, a whole big group, stage productions and fountains in the last few months. Randy Newman and David Mamette did their musical version of the Goodman Theatre, Doreka Theatre Company. Actually kicked the butts of Randy Newman and their version. Somebody I stood when the summer I came under who Dam Yankees came through starring Jerry Lewis. It's Fowl's Fowl's Fowl's, this town is Fowl's Crazy. So if you can wish jump on the bear market. We say that's what we're doing this Alan. And today's show is deals with the devil selling your soul. We are at a three of our program, Voyager. In the upper face, when the devil appears to the first time, he says simply, here we are. Why are you surprised? See, that is the way to do it. That is the way to do that. The problem in our daily lives is that, when we're off to deal with the devil. We often do not know. but that is the choice of make. This next story is about a bargain of bad. This American life producer released people headed home to Baltimore to meet with a friend of Bruce, Jane Potter. Jane and I meet in the court yard of the Bebody Conservatory of Newspaper, and walked down the street to Lewis bookstore cafe. For my routine age, Jane and I would get a lose between our western violin lessons. We did fish sandwiches, talk about music and coffee art columns. Jane is Korean. When Jane was 11, Jane and her mother, her violin teacher and her own. All drove four hours from the small town where she grew up to Seoul, South Korea's capital. They went to a big hotel, the hotel world ruins the Lebanese and international tourist state, and went to the room of violinist Brousen asking. She played in the Mendusen violin concert. I think the first thing you said was, well the first thing that my aunt translated to us was, , is you come to the states and stand with me. It was a pass. is impossible. , with your family, you allow her to go asking my mother this basically. And my mother, I remember my mother just being , what, what, you want, what, , , she was just suddenly confused and then at the same thing, I could see her just , sort of  smiling  she could believe, , her daughter, , whatever. No one in June is family room, she'd be getting into if she accepted to Nassau's offer to go to America. But it was clear. beginning that if Jaina went she would go along. that was talking about, , maybe you might have to give her up for adoption. I kind of almost remember feeling , now he is asking me, , who do I be willing to keep up my parents and my family or this glamorous life, whatever. At the time I didn't understand, I was... Wow, my power. What, no half?! Yes, me this question. I don't want you to faint. Later, Janis has she brings out the violin. I asked her to play me the Mendelssohn, as long as she played for Mr. Sinozki. The song that literally divided her life into past and present, the opening melody as famous for being part of the choir. I remember the first time I saw a game, she was short and chubby and dressed in red Korean coat. I immediately after coming to America, Jaina dropped about 20 pounds. I remember people whispering that she was chubby when she arrived because meals were the only time that Jaina's stricted to create mother would allow her to stop practicing. There were other rumors. All part of the Jaina misty, the young Korean prodigy would suck. I so much come alone from career to studying bottom-on. Classical music  Bella Eirge Masters is a discipline of the trenches aesthetic, the greater the sacrifice the bigger the hero. And to P.B. A second-rate music school in a second-rate town, June a sacrifice in town were limpian. You were all odd. No one so young played so well. Inheat family. Some급 family. Tstage honest. Handle thatcap in the name of the Echo. Tstage honest. The next part. There's good Quest of temporada. Staff. Ah-ha-ha. Bend it with your hand and get aware there. So don't drag me down to do this, chgoing. Be a little coward sometimes. More辦法. But Geno's own instant love for a parlor of three, that isn't interior. Call the killstone and other synoscis student was about the same age as June and I Who'd all hang out together place based in theaters in the Peebadi lounge and big money off our moms for the candy machines? Then I remember you being in the car with my mom and me and Was it  the first time ever that I was the first time I and I remember you Private ask each and a however and there was a ship That was my first What cuz Now you and Crow are trying to teach me,  you guys just took me by the hand. Okay, look, see, that's a shit. And I was , oh, oh, shit. Shit. Genesis, the first couple of years in America were everything she wanted them to be. Everything was new, everything was interesting. But life with her host family was good. She did well in competitions, and since it not speak that as manager to set up some concerts for her in Holland. Then after two years of study at P-Buddy, dinner went back to Korea for the first time. Which came back to America. things you're to all part. The relationship with your host family deteriorated. I don't know what it was but I think  the last third year or something  that that I was living with. My really started to feel  my presence there was a party to them. No, and that's when it started getting hurt because then I realized oh my gosh, what am I doing? I've been here, I've been living with the family that's not mine. Basically strangers,  what? What can they passfully, ,  about this? She left that post family and moved in with another, and then left them for another. More was expected to enter than if any of us, and she was essentially raising herself. She was lonely and stirred to Mr. Camlin, Korea at one point she caught her mom. Well, I was really upset, I'm quite cold enough. crying and I said, , can I just come back and just go back to school there and at least, , let me try that and see if that works, . And I was really hoping if not assuming, , that my mother was to say, sure, I can't come back, . And I said, that's ridiculous, , you think that was... So long now and  now you have to carry on what you've been doing. And I just remember hanging up, I don't remember what I said, I just remember hanging up, feeling so desperate. I remember Janet doing this product product. I remember driving her back to Mark's or her son sitting with her in my car outside her house. I was 16 and she was 14. I remember her telling me about the problems. family back home Korea. Prof. was having financial difficulties. Her brother was having trouble getting into the right college, which encouraged her to turn this whole future. And her sister had had some kind of breakdown and was putting to a mental institution. There's all very draining in Jane and was having a hard time, but what I remember best was that these crises somehow forced Jane to think about her decision to come to America in a new way. Watching her family struggle from a distance, somehow brought her face to face for her own distance from them and from her culture. I remember her telling me that she thought she could never go back to Korea. That she had missed too much. I was accused constantly by my family of becoming so American. But then I would look at myself here and I would be hanging out with my friends and stuff. And I would also look at myself, it's feel  a touch, but I'm not  them. I'm not one of them. So I really just kind of felt  I didn't belong anywhere. And that's when I am. I'll slap the hat. In the world of classical music, if you don't make it as a soloist by the time you're 16 or 17, odds are you never gonna make it. At 20 it hadn't happened for Gainet. She was so practicing and competing, but it was more of a struggle. And so  one day I just decided, okay, I'm gonna try something else. I only know what it's  to not be a violinist. So I put my violin away and for two weeks, every day for two weeks I was just living  a non-violinist. I was going to bookstores, looking for, I don't know, I was reading, trying to look for what, what, I just, I was, wanting, I don't know, I was kind of wanting that, that luxury of being able to choose for myself. But even to me, I'm really missed it, really missed the music. Someone recently wrote the tragedy of Bob Dulles not only that he sold out his principles, and sold out everything he ever. believed in to become president, this deficit hawk who campaigned on the kind of tax cutscenes to ridicule is food to economics. But after you saw it out his principles in the soul, you discovered that there were no buyers. Janice Stray reminds me that she agrees that yes, she made a fastening bargain. She left her family, left her country, left her home, but she never got the gaming fortune she made all those sacrifices for. And when I talked to her, I somehow expected her to be as conflicted at that age as she was when we were in my part 16. But in fact, she was fine. Her feelings had changed and she's outgoing, her premise in part. She doesn't particularly want to be a soloist and she's not driven to see. With her without violence, Janet Fiddler, her life in America, to the restricted motion would have had in Korea. And the recently, her parents have started talking about coming to the states, living in the first they can closer. She finds these conversations make her nervous. She doesn't want to give up being to pet and she's had such things a lot. I don't, I don't feel. Because I don't feel regret that he was there and that I gave him to this deal or I don't know if I should say I keep in Or I really don't regret the fact that he was there. That they listen to me, they say in those things. I don't think that he was wrong. Because I have to say it was just a very adventurous thing to do. And I really feel  if I had a choice to stay home and do this, I think every time I would choose it. Just to go. June is at 23. She still is too buddy. She takes a little bit of a gap around this dress and you can consider it as your extra in-bought. She is a sponsor, a businessman in North Carolina who heard her performing now helps her with the monthly check. At her apartment, after Cling 3 saw us from me, Gina stops and is back to her violin away. She asks, should I keep playing? And I say, sure, play more. No, she says. I mean the violin. Gina is still wondering. At Quart, Carmen becomes fouls. When I was nearing my 30th birthday, I decided it was about time to get off welfare. Both the children were in school and old dreams of being a hippie revolutionary, scrounging for a pound of gold-gird soybeans and a mountains, didn't seem nearly as romantic as it had five years before. My husband had run off to the Virgin Islands two winners before, the fat Jewish girl who caught on the lock. somebody down there who had a boat. When this story begins, the story of another deal with the death, another person coming in from the sticks to the big city. Carmen Delle's L is living in a tenant farmer's shack, no farm or a carcass, water comes from a pump, is heated on the Ashley Woodstone, 1978. And it earned a way out of there. Carmen Delle's L started to go to auctions, thrift stores out in the country, and by step chief that she could drive into Washington, B.C. and sell for higher prices, clean markets there. I must have been a sight in those days, with my folding tables and clothes racks, ragged looking children and droghtown. I think I was pretty thin, but I didn't know it. I wore peasant glasses with no desire, and my hair was long and curly and white-laught from the sun. You must realize that in those days, hippie women were really different from straight women. We thought we were practically another race. We believed in all kinds of dogmas and rhetoric. We believed it and we lived. That eating meat was one of them. Smoking dope is really important. We believe in karma and revolution and whole lot of obscure practices We self-ceiling on it. They have a whole lot of sense back then. So in a young lawyer, a real estate broker or something, we'd come along and hang around too long. I didn't know what to think. Didn't they know that we will wills apart in every way? What could we possibly have to say to each other? I was so naive. When the man who ran the flea market invited me out to dinner and steak and egg kitchen, I was flabbergously. I was, but I went in. By now it was beginning to get chilly. Money would really be tight when it got too cold to sell on the street, so I decided to go to a fortune tellie. She lived and worked in a storefront in Chinatown. She was fat and sneaky looking and had only one grass, but has turned out she was right about everything to calm and she gave me three wishes. I wish from apartmentoler. and an antique store. She gave me a strange list of things to buy. They were a bottle of Chinese blow-wash, four-seven-day candles, red white blue and green, a box of bonio sun grados, which means spare bath, white flowers, jinx removal powder, and Indian money draw soap. I drove back to the country $20 poor and kind of depressed that I proved it so vulnerable. That was on Saturday. On Sunday I poured the bottle of China. in the house of it. This was to clear out evil spirits. Then when the children went to sleep, I began the ritual of the spirit bath. I placed the candles around the galvanized tin tub that we used for everything. Fill the rest of the petals of hot water, and poured in the first bottle of red liquid from the box I bought. Just before I got in the tub, I arranged the white roses in front of my dead mother's picture. This was to ensure her blessing and ask her to enter. seen in my behalf. As soon as I got in the water, I got this weird tingly feeling. The shadows from the candles loomed around me  ghosts in the water look  blood. I set their naked and shivering by the wood stove and prayed out loud for God to send me things I associated with red. I asked for sex, adventure, and central heat. I also asked for red cowboy boots in the Ruby ring. On Monday morning, I drove to Calpec or found the cowboy boots for $2. The pink lady shop and the ring in the jar. buttons, which we'll let me have between five cents. That might be an awful man for the flea market to have that seed in sped the night. I realized my next wishes would have to be more specific. Tuesday evening I repeated the ritual except the water turned blue. I found it a harder color to match with things I needed so I just asked for general good fortune. Nothing special happened Wednesday but nothing went wrong either. Well it went on  that for the next 14 days. I loved�장. turned. I found better close in the thrift shops than I'd ever found before, made over a hundred dollars in the free market. My landlord began to smile and wave at me when I drove past this house and let us with small checks and then arrive at the post office. But I guess I have to get to the unbelievable part and hear what it is. A handsome young millionaire came up to me that last day of the baths had offered me free rent and a sunny slum apartment. Ten thousand dollars to start my own business. Sounds  I'll lie, doesn't it? I know it does, but it's true. Soon after we move there, he fell in love with him, and we all lived together that winter sleeping on mattresses on the floor, eating Chinese food and cardboard containers. That was one of the happiest times in my life, but I missed certain things about living alone in the country. Dark side of the magic had to reveal itself yet, so we blindly enjoyed our warm rooms, and I thank Jesus every night for his blessings. I've heard that we punish ourselves better and more profoundly than any spirits or gods we can imagine. I hope that's true. I hope that's true because I still feel guilty. Because you see David, the millionaire, is married, and I know it from the very beginning. Invited me to Washington, do you see the half dinner with him and his wife? I remember everything about that night. I want antique dress platform shoes and three car fake items. bracelets. My entire outfit cost less than $10. His wife had a mint coat and long red fingernails. I was very impressed with her. They invited me to drive for my little house and Virginia to discuss a business deal. He was a swam landlord, she had an antifogged of slower. They had discovered me selling things at the Georgetown Blue Market and wanted me to trade clothes through her apartment and a 10-minute cross town. It seemed  a good idea to me. time. So I took the place, but things didn't really go as they were intended to. The apartment was cramped and lonely. All the other tenants were on strike because the building was falling down and David, the owner, wanted me to be his mistress. During this time, my visits to the local Haitian food store became more frequent. You must understand that living in the ghetto is very difficult. living in any other part of town. Even the grocery store's cell statues of Santa Barbara, San Lzaro and the Virgin Mary. And when one of the neighbors was found dead on the front stoop, the Jamaican woman who suned rest  an ninja and practiced swing his numb chops in the hall, put holy candles all around the lobby in the order of the seven African powers. We were the only white family on the block. It was very lonely. My only comfort was sitting in the cool spooky Catholic church. looking at the handmade dog clothes the ladies made for the snatchers. And then, one full moon I put on my black velvet dress, pinned with a rhinestone dagger, wrapped a small box of jinx removed with powder and a white handkerchief, walked across town to the house where David and his wife had. It was not really clear to me at the time when I was up to. I felt as if I was being guided by an unseen force. But I swear I had no real idea of what I was doing. Took a pine branch and I put it to the male song. And then I left the school package on the stove, set a few magic words and ran. The next morning when David came out to get the paper he found the stick in the spell. His wife asked him to go by half a half at her coffee because they were having weekend guests. David says he doesn't really know why. He decided to go to the little tea and they buy my house. But when he got there. decided to come see me. Until that moment, I needed one of us to stop anything for the other. When I opened the door who was standing there crying, said he loved me and couldn't live without me. I said the same thing, and he never went back home. His wife sued him for a million dollars, all the furniture and the Mercedes. She won, but I got him. It took me years to figure out how to get away. It's true that I loved him for a while, or at least I thought I did. But looking back on it, I realized I'd been alone so long that I would have probably thought I wasn't loved with anybody who took care of him. I remember when he bought me this Diana Ross song, I know I'll never love this way again. I played that before he came over and danced around the house. I was in my private room. Then my brother was found half dead of a barbitured overdose in the woods of West Virginia on a commune, and he came to live with us. Four people on three remote partners. One thing led to another and David took us all under his name. Michael tried to kill himself two more times. Christmas came and went. David gave me $40 a week into me out to dinner, which sometimes cost three times there. I felt  I was else. Salvador and David was America. I used to scream and cry and beg until let me go. One of the neighbors put it into words very well, me carved, landlords, poor, and front door. I refused to let David have it painted over. It was true. There are only two kinds of friends who take all my reason away. One is the friends of love, one is the friends of meeting money. I got to the point where I was in a constant sense. I need a lawyer. and a psychiatrist. My cripple brother moved across the street to another hot slum of partner, and lived with a black woman named May. They fought over money, other men, his living was closed on the floor from her pick up, etc. She was very beautiful,  Diana Ross. She said drunk on straight chin and watched soap opera all day. They would give them $200 a week to live on, as part of our understanding. Even though we never discussed it, I knew that my staying with him kept my brother from another suicide attempt. The money gave us all a false sense of security, the thought of him being taken away, honored as possible. There was 30 years old, the children were aided for, my brother was 24, and David was 33 and already a million air. Then one hot night in June, I began to break all the windows in the apartment with my bare hands. I began to scream out the window that this is what happened to a woman when she had to sell her body to pay the rent. They would try to homey down and cover my mouth, but I broke away and ran down three flights of stairs screaming. And I got out on the cement steps, he and his brother caught me again. But before they realized what was happening, I ripped my dress in two and stood there naked and yelling, take it, take it, this is all you want. This is what you pay for, my body, not me just this body. His brother slapped me in the face and they drugged me naked at the cement stairs. scraping the skin off my back. I don't remember too much after that, but nothing really changed. We went on living there, my brother went on living across the street. Two years later he finally did kill himself by jumping out the window. We kept his remains in the kitchen cabinet for a long time. It took me seven years to get rid of David. Ronald Reagan was up for a second term that year. He was invited to the inaugural ball. David wanted me to go too. Now I do know people who would be delighted to get to the inaugural ball just to see what it's . But I was so superstitious. I was sure God would strike me dead for hard nodding with the richest meanest congregation on earth. So I went back to the beauty ladies. she told me what to do. First I had to take an apple and cut that score. Then I was to write my problem on a piece of paper and put it in the side. Then I had to wrap the apple with a black ribbon while I chanted, bind him, bind him, take away his power and set me free. And then on the first night of the new move, I buried the apple in the non-scribier behind the sacred heart church. The next day the children arrived rope to Cincinnati. for an all-heels angel-fraid of mine ran a tattoo par. I got him to put a big red heart and dagger up high on my bicep. I knew no good with public command would ever want to be seen with me again. And  what? He did. The truth is that  any other third world country that tries to cut itself off from America too quickly, our economy has never recovered. And that's why tonight by the full moon I've returned to the bar when we first made it. our faithful bargain to beg him for enough money to pay the rent. They say that once you start messing with their call, you're forever in a step. Carmen Delle Zellgus and Beauty Texas, she just opened a vintage clothing store called Lucky Day. get out any egg. SG-25 OECU involve eating and swimming and too much wheat. first contact. No, there's been so many retellings of the the Faustory, Marlo, Gertor, Sayers, Thomas, and they're very various versions of the opera Faust, but only one person, as far as we can determine, only one person, is intended to tell the story of the devil coming to Earth to steal someone's soul. As a children's story, the person is a Daniel Pinkwater, he's agreed to read his book Devil in the Dream, and our program today. I knew that the devil lived inside our plumbing. I could hear him making noises, especially down the drain of the kitchen scene. Sometimes I would look into the drain pipe with a flashlight, try to see you. Finally I cut a glimpse of something down there. Hey I said are you the devil? By the way I am, a voice from down the drain and it's just one of no, that's always I don't have to tell you anything, the voice said. Come up here so I can see you I said. Oh no, you'll turn on the water as soon as I get there and get me all wet. No, I won't cut a s- Well, that's what I would do. You are the devil aren't? Yes. I'd really  to have a look at you. If I absolutely promised not to turn on the war, you come up so I can see you. Why do you want to see me? I just do. Come on up. I won't hurt you. Besides, there are those little bar things across the drain. I couldn't get at you if I wanted to. I'm not afraid of you and the devil. Then come up and let me see. Alright, but if you turn on the water, I'll do some pretty bad things to you. You really suspicious. You would be too if you were me. The devil said, his voice sounds gross. Are you coming up? I asked down the dream? Yes, I'm coming, the devil said. And don't say it's my fault if you can scare the death. I'm not scared, I said. Well, you should be. I could see the devil climbing up the dream. It was pretty small. He wasn't any bigger than the goldfish I had lost up. that dream once when I was changing the water and fishbone. The devil got up to the little crossed bars. He had a face that reminded me of the fish and he was almost the same colon. Well, here I am, the devil said, you got terrified, right? Do you remember when I lost my fish down this drain? I mean, sure I do. The devil said, you murdered him. I did not. It was an accident. Sure it was. The devil said, poor fish, he probably trusted the water over a float and got slashed out of the bowl. down the drain I said I don't think he was smart enough to trust me or not trust me efficient. That's right for them said tell yourself that I heard him crying for help you didn't even care I didn't care I said I didn't kill him on purpose but you admit you killed him just now what you do I asked what try to make people feel bad about things they can't help it's one of the things I do when the devil said now admit it you feel pretty horrible what killing that fish right I didn't kill him I said I don't feel that bad about it. I'm sorry it happened, but it wasn't my fault. I'm getting bored talking about your stupid fish, as I was saying. How can you have it mentioned how frightening I am at the same time, sort of fascinating? You look a little  a fish, I say. How can you live in the plumbing? Again with the fish, the devil said. I live with the plumbing because I can do whatever I please. How can you so small? I'm as big as I need to be, as I said. How about you, can you be a pretzel? Do you have any of those skinny salty ones? I got the devil with press, I pushed it down the drain, he ate. That was Lousy, he said. I know you only got it because you saw frightened of me. Look, I said, I got you with the press, because you asked for it. You want the other press, I'll get you another press. I happen to be a good nature kid and I am not released to frame you. Yes, I do. That was, do what? Yes, I do what, another press, I'll get it. Ah, the kid's terrified, the devil said. him so I heard him say it. That does it I said. I turned on both terms, hot and cold. Hey, no fair the devil shall. Too bad I said. I heard the devil shouting in the mirror with the long way down the drain. He was really mad. That was a rotten trick you shot it. You ought to be ashamed. I'm not. I said. Then you'll think or just book devil in the drain for instanthan. by Children's Library, is Oliver America. Really?
