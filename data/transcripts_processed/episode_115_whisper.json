First time you ever had a first day. I've been at the time of Targetless 3 and a half. Everything was always the same. She didn't the same day care since she was 6 months old. Her parents were still together, but they've been the same place. Her house has these rooms in it, and her backyard is this way. Her teachers are the same teachers. Her friends have been the same friends for 3 and a half. And for 3 and a half. years, which in her timeframe is all of eternity. There are no other friends. There are no other people. That's what dad, our contributing editor Jack hit. He says that all of this change the day that he discovered that he could switch type of way to a different school, a preschool that was a lot closer in the house. As he told type of it was a school with the big kids go. They said we know, so , I told him, she idea of moving on to the next stage in her life. The first time she'd ever... And that option was so exciting. She literally jumped out of her chair. Grant circles, runs, cafeteria. Streaming, dancing, just sending a Pozana's glee. And we talked about it all weekend long. No, it's all the books they, this is a big sense. You talked about it all weekend long ago. What was there to talk about? Or just in other. that would be people and teachers who everything that part is going to be just, you say that to a three-year-old, I think that's interesting because it doesn't fit a bit of the experience that can't ring. She had never had a first day before this and comes a big day. Is that up for school? On the morning of her first day, this was a long-to-setting off of the Atlanta. We walked up the block on the right, started down to the supplies and supermarkets. On the first day, any first day, we're expected to live by the rules and customs and culture that were in the frame. But we don't know those rules and customs, just yet. It is a very particular time. And all the kids at the school, the typely, was after it. They all were ready to new each other in the year before she was the new comer. first day of the second day. But I remember it. I remember the gut friendship. All I came to pick up was the one and all. So, it started to crash. It was the reason for us to walk on the show. It told her that she could play. That was this old group. She was my daughter. She should stay. She never heard that expression or that I need to find. Question what's interesting is that the person made that partner is now on his face. Do you make that? Well, I mean, I think that he's in his natural part of the finding group. And I don't know why. But there's not a profession or a career or a group out there that on some level doesn't have. Some ritual in which the new member is either tormented or tortured or beaten or humiliated.

The whole thing reminds me of who the gangs were carrying Chicago, turning a gang here in Chicago or really caught up. You need to get jumped in, , your future gang brothers or sisters taking into an alley and beat the hell out of you. There is just something primal and intimate about the entire thing. Is it the existence of the first day, the simple presence of an outsider who wants to be an insider? It's so profound, so disturbing to any group that they have to crush you, prove you harmless, whether you are walking what you want, but not. one. This is the disturbing aura that surrounds the first step. Welcome to the Easy Chicago Public Radio International, it's a American life horror glass. Today on our program, first day, three of outsiders who show up wanting to be insiders and what it takes to make the jump. At one, lost at sea, how cussing can get you from moments when recent fails.

Alright you all listen to our show may remember dishwasher peed, he is an actual dishwasher. for eight years as he was pursuing his quest to watch dishes and every state of the union he is up to 33 states. To score Louisiana he thought they were trying to get a job and boil it out in the gull mess. But it was one problem. It would mean breaking with people's the fun to prove it. Basically, the rule is this. Never work at a job where I can't quit and leave the moment the notion struck me. For 10 years, ever since I had established the fundamental rule, I had never broken it. You wanted to try it out. do we have some more right? Maybe, just maybe he could dare head off to a bigger dream. To watch dishes on a fishing boat for months, off the coast of Alaska. With that in mind, set off to task at the Thunder Dragon World. This is the company that's quite galling hands for oil rigs, and the small town that site in the Orleans, filled out a bunch of paperwork and sat around with half dozen other athletes. But my name is finally called a walk down the hall to where a guy greeted me. Two stunned to catch his name. I could only stare at him and think, Hey, my car is lo- Clinton who is an absolute dead-ringer for Bill Clinton can take my eyes off them as he led me into his office. Resembles was remarkable, he had same puppy cheeks, the same dipluchin, the same song of her hair and hair cut. He even had that familiar Clinton smirk. Only this guy smirk seems to say, I know you think I look  Clinton, you're dying to ask me about it. I have a couple of things to do with the application. Such as the make and license statement with my car. I don't have a car, I said, you don't. Why not? , , this is just a need one. When you need one for this job, in fact, only a car is the most important qualification for being a galley hit. At the only car to watch dishes on an oil reef, that's right. When you're on call in the dispatcher calls and tells you to be down at the coast in three hours, you have to be there. We can't wait for the final card forward to find some. I'm going to drive you. Oh well, in that case, I do own a car. Great, what kind? It's a station wagon. And what's license plate number? Not sure. You don't know your own license plate number? Well, I have to go outside and check on it. You go do that then. Step to that side and wrote down the license plate number for car that I hope wasn't his. And then went back and gave it to him. Minutes later, I was issued a hard hat, safety glasses and two workshops. I give over 65. How do I find it so interesting or what? You see? Know, I am not saying it. Wrong! So unfortunate cause. I hoped I'd surely even wear me boots. And then I drove that head off by a naked gun. That's a good idea. Not very bummed. × long head out of gear. Really stupid. I want to weld it up for them. Estilation ringer. lasted for 15 more minutes. as now officially on Paul. I spent the rest of the afternoon walking back to the city, crashing at my last bleeding moment of freedom. As on the verge of breaking the fundamental rule into the preceding need disaster, to make my spreading worse the next day, a friend of a friend who claimed to be familiar with life on the oil rigs told me I could expect to be hazed, as it overcoming my occupational arily hitting the car. Steam Center for Interhop production for Toyota잌 목youruvis and spring infrastructure for Toyotaors for EcoStoneP homeowners. Let's win it! put up with idiots hazing me as well. Two days later, as blown to an oil rig, go for next throw. The helicopter approached the center of the three connected platforms, landed on the roof of its uppermost structure. I asked the pilot, where would I find the galley? Go down those stairs and someone will show you we said. It took off my headset, put on my hard hat and safety glasses, grabbed my bag and hopped out. Help the door open. You locked in spray-might links. to the outside world. So where do you say the galley was? I shouted over the world of the whirling blades. Just go down those stairs. The pilot shouted back. Shut the door. Shut the door and ran across the roof. It's a dash down the stairs. The helicopter revved up. Pause momentarily for reasons to temptation to run back up the roof. Fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do that faced consequences. Down the stairs, I caught my head through an open door and asked the guy which we felt. Go this way in that, said down the stairs and load, can't miss it. Follow this direction to found myself out in the middle of the platform. Surrounded by cargo containers and pipes and a suit at the industrial chunk. He passed it, the doors packed that way. The way in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came. I looked, didn't find any doors. Apparently a little fun was already being had at the new guys' expense. But they're gonna leave me a little bit of damn rake searching for the galley. First myself, or let me helicopter leave them down. Then notice because it's cardboard that I've scrolled in right here now. You read. Keep out. This means you. Wet floor. Signed. Redneck. Signed home from what I read. Signed home from what I read. realized with the doorhand, tugged and pulled and turned the handle every which way but think it damn door to butt was so green even a lot of simple latch as helpless until almost magically door-uncontained inside. In front of me stood the guy at scene through the window. Get sun! He said, don't just stand there, play with yourself, come on in! Introduce himself as red, the galley spirit, my boss. He stepped inside and asked him where the galley was. And you're in the mother. Gally stopped looking around as pretty sure yet people at me aren't even though I could see a small kitchen whole space was barely bigger than the kitchen and dining room of the house Where's everybody eat then I asked right? Good there Redneck said kicking one of the two fences at face to counter a long one wall Obviously a hundred employees can fit on those two benches, but since he seemed to think I was billable I played along Yeah, okay, I said The re-court acting as the official welcoming me arrived right behind me. He's tracking me what to do in case of emergency. There's an explosion, he said, run to whatever platform isn't burning. Redneck, as I was later learned he insisted on being called, introduced me to cause the other galleads, who was mopping the kitchen. My job instructions were redneck, so... As long as you keep them f***ing dishes clean, they're in a mud f***ing, and this riggy gives you f***ing. After a brief tour of the small kitchen, right next showed me to my station. Step up to the sinks, and as soon as my preferred dishwasher sinks, looking straight ahead, I saw her. Right there, above the sinks, perfectly at eye level, was a portal. I immediately knew that this little window to the world would play a huge role in helping me survive two weeks without putting. We looked at her at the endless experience. Let's go. mix. There wasn't much to look at. Whole lot of sea, whole lot of sky, dozens of rigs up in the distance. But already I felt at ease. My gaze was broken by redneck feet and we sang, they partner, they partner. I didn't initially recognize my new nickname. They partner and said, , f***, that's much to you. No, I ain't f***. really said, the mother f*** got to the boat of us then and he did. Then it was time for lunch. Renek explained that despite the fact that the rig was surprised at pre-connected platforms, the crew was actually pretty small. Altogether, there were about 30 people to be fed. Their meal times were staggered so they were never more than pirates' disguise in the Caliat and he could... time. The slow but steady pace fights the dishes as well. The row is dishes for me to wash, never any rush, get in the bed. Several times during lunch, crew hands walked up to me in the kitchen with big greens and the pieces and asked, how's it going bro? Okay, I tried. They waited. For what? I had no idea. They waited and then the griller stayed with me in the standout of the kitchen. One guy said, let's just quiet ask my the f***er's problem redneck. He likes looking at that f***er window, what can I say? I didn't understand. I watched the dishes. I looked at the window. I minded my own business. Just as redneck had an instruct. I would anyone have a problem with that. For a few more of these counters, for the next couple of days, I immediately realized what was going on. The righands, after working at greedy ship, were rast about when we were upnicking, expected to be greeted in the alley with some woody remark or joke. Maybe even a song or name. The expected Gally hands were tied to some public relief  a court Jessica. But they got instead, was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea. Well, too bad. How's it there that entertain anyone? I want to jump and jump in for diners. I would have come away later. Redneck was never at ease. Be raised back and forth across the tiny kitchen when you go. but constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips. There's a fun and funny guy, but he had a nervous edge that was attributed by all, including himself to the seven years he spent as a CIA mercenary in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. He never saw a redneck sit down for more than 30 seconds before he jumped up again and re-zoomed his frantic face. He grew especially nervous when he and I were alone in the alley and I stood staring at my portable. Got damn partner, say f*** something. I definitely say, usually I just curse. Let's get out of that. Good, let's see. You got that right partner, you'd . Good. Then after further contemplation, you'd have. Mother, f**k it. Not an hour passed without redneck reason, one of his favorite topics for discussion. Sex with parmaine holes. The technique was raised in a parmaine arcad cell. quite knowledgeable about having sexual farm animals and wasn't stingy with this information. He was also always prepared to discuss another favorite topic whatever Puzz was around, the various ways to kill a man. Between Redneck's experiences in Southeast Asia, and Puzz's experiences in street-kinged and prism, they had plenty of stories to share and information to exchange. Sometimes, when I broke from my day dreaming at the window, I found a dip-pulled a deciphered, exactly which topic Redneck was presently discussing. He just sneak up behind him and catch up. around as f***ing knick  that, not f***ing all years! Every day the gop ones through a metamorphosis. For hours on end, I watched the end of the six-pensive water, slosh up and down, back and forth as the creative fish, corpses, seaweed, stingrays, grouphood and jellyfish swam, go to past. Seabirds sword by an affix course to someone seen the summation of down. horizon. I had the dozens butter or rigs that stood five, ten, twenty miles across the water heaping. Some appeared no bigger than a blip on the horizon. I wondered a lot about the galley hands on those rigs, we were staring back at the blip that was our rig. The more I stared out of the goal, the more extreme sticks that came by the water. There was water as far as I could see in all directions. I was surrounded by it, as trapped by it. My hands soaked and drank it constantly. More I stared at the water, the less I understood. to it. The hazing aid period has a green horn never materialized. At each day passed, the pump worked out and acted last four or two weeks of putting. Accounted down to departure took the way rapidly. Three days in the wake up, two days in the wake up, one day in the wake up. Finally there was nothing left for the wake up. No more shifts to work, no more dishes to wash, just had to wake up, jump on the helicopter. I'm not going to stop it. I'm not back to the day I landed on the rig. The end of my first ship, Cookie. The night's, I'd ask me. Does your first day on the rig? Yeah, I said. For the first day is the worst, and all the rest are just the same. This Russian Peak Street was first published in the Zee and he writes that publishes. This washer. Hey, , you better listen to me every one of you We've got a lot of lot of lot of work to do forget about you in the water Who they are working for Back to Squawk hop The first day among other things means human error it means mistakes it means this happens the Miyaした That is true in a job or any rest for a day of curves, you don't know the ropes. What else could happen? We have this story from a police officer, now a veteran of the forest in the suburban community. There was nothing, nothing going on Saturday night, just no idea. Really quiet, super cold. And this cold came over for unknown animal in the house. And that was on my post. 25 years away. So I myself and another car were assigned to the call and we show up there and luckily for me it was another guy who's pretty knit. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on, the nylon code, the vest, the belt, the whole, all on your own. And the door opens and the guy who is behind the door he's about 30, I was 23 at the time. He's about 30, he looks  a broker or a lawyer's really well put together, nice guy. right, right glasses, for instance,  silk pajamas with a monogram, got my attention. And he's going, , let's not only start a body, , normal head handle the sort of stuff on my own, but, , my wife really insists that I call and, so we asked him what the problem. And he says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down the living room. And we heard the scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was, the tarot that's called from the attic. Something up there, it's just running around. Not... a few small things over. I can't tell what it is. Just scroll around and put everything on them. So the other cop that I was with said, well, , we really don't have that it's not so much a police function. It's, , but we do have numbers of these private contractors. So men and they'll put a you main trap down and they'll be down with Boyan. Too many not such a big deal, but it's really not our thing. So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings to go back and there's his wife. who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful. perfect skin, long blonde hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile. Just  beautiful and friendly. , if she had said, , he just broke in glass, I just would have said, okay, broken glass, it is, it's fun. But she, she seemed really nice, so I'm. was gonna be  gala-hat. So I just threw my arm back into this guys chest. And my partner's chaffin' I said, Mark, we can endless. It'll be okay. And she just was just, , thank you so much. She was really sweet and I was struck dead. So, walk inside. And she goes, I'm gonna throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs and follow the house upstairs. And we're underneath one of those trap doors because into the attic, but the staircase to hold down. And we do here, and animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And if that's something up there, and it's making pretty good speed up, going from one end to the roof to the other. So I reached up and I took the trap door down, we unfolded the ladder. Now, it's big, heavy flashlight. You're here, cop flashlight. D-cell of the metal case, the whole thing. I shot it up through the hole in there and it's pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the lot. Now the guy who own the house is standing almost directly underneath me just to the side of the ladder. Looking straight up at me. And my corner is at the base and a lot of right behind me. So just before I start my head to just  black hole, I just kind of pull us  I crunch my body if underneath, because I'm gonna have some G, , I don't know where this thing is. The second we pull... on the trap door all noise upstairs just ceased. So I was kind of nervous and I was , well, , I look  I can hit you, just crash the pin, pop it a lot or so I took the flashlight, I just popped my head up and turned the light on again. And I've had six inches from the front of my face was this swirl at eye level with me kind of your back on its legs and I swear from where I was standing. It. look  Godzilla. It just scared me. I thought it was a squirrel. It's going to be hiding somewhere. It's going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, ah, jump back. And the flashlight slips out of my hands as heavy and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who's looking straight up at me. And I don't think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose, his hands up to his face, blood just started pointing up to his hands. This is the homeowner. This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards directly on my partner and I just I pancake I thought we both thought our backs. He's on his back. I'm on his stomach on my back Skuddling around  a  a beat  how that get up in a really narrow hallway to mess the squirrel while we're Floundering around it in a hallway Jump downstairs blank blank Lands on a knee and takes off on his ass Hell and dignified So we're wondering, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, he hears a scream. So my party goes, well, , we found squirrel. It's where we're shot. Yeah, so we go run and dance there. And the squirrel had come into the living room where they had been having there. romance, even had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around. One of them. quarter of the couch next to the fire and they have a champagne food's out. It's nice house. Really nice. I mean it's just snowed brand new carpeting new roads and they have been there for that long. So the squirrel might have pulled it down the staircase to the coffin of the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is deleting all over the place on his carpet. His white looks and says, , what are you done? It's one of you done to my husband. I start going off. was an accident and I just thought it was a point. We've only been there about two minutes. So the squirrel is underneath the couch and my corner is going, , let's get out of here. This is just, , it's not going well. So I am not being yet. I always have another idea. So the squirrel, though, is under this couch, in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don't we move to prior to our way from one of the corners and we'll put the couch. in the corner and the school will probably move along with the couch because it's only cover you available to it and once you get into the corner, we only have two open sides attached to worry that. So we did that. That is so tactical. Yes, yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instance, but I asked her for a box and she says, sure, we've got boxes with them. We have a box and she runs out of the garage and she comes back to the box and the box is long enough and fits across the entire short side of the couch where you'd be interested in the office. So I start sweeping underneath, and caps with my night stick, Connor moved the scroll toward the box, figuring out where capture it, just get rid of it. We'll be out of here and there'll be no more thing. So it's actually working very well on the scrolls moving down along. You can hear it, it's chittering, and I'm trying not to hurt it. , if you kind of, I'm nervous about the thing that might bite me. I don't want to hurt it, really. No, it's just an owl. Right. So I'm moving it along, everything's going very well. And then with about eight inches. to go, I took one more swipe and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch, it was lined up  tasked, you can see the couch bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. It was the fireplace directly ahead of it and it ran into the fire and caught on fire and ran directly back out and directly back on the couch. Is it on the fire? Yeah, the tail, the push. the whole bit and it wasn't  flaming or anything but there was smoke in and there was a little bit fire on the tail so it runs back under the couch and the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean in seconds it must have had dust under there or something but it just it caught on fire immediately and my partner and I just don't even talk to grab the couch see that upside down and now there's plenty of oxygen. in the afternoon. It's starting to get out and it's sort of getting away from us. So we grabbed the only thing that's really available and those are these really nice silky pillows. We have one of these hand, four of us and we're just win-milling away at this fire on the couch and we put it out. But it's smoking terribly and it was just a disaster. The houses are upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filled with. smoke from the couch the squirrel when it went into the couch and its death rose Just latched on the quantum to couch it's  the smoke piece of gristle underneath the couch latched on it with his claws and were pounding smearing it all over the place and The smoke alarms are firing away the guy standing in his  with the Hacker chips paper towels a brem's nose still being his pajamas are a mess And we finally get The fire out and we're both completely red sweating because we're dressed for  zero to go to weather and it's hot there by the fire We're mortified the house is full of smoke the white Just looks around and just starts to cry she goes what what do you done? What have you done to my house? You could see you're just  clicking things off on our fingers That's what we'll do New couch I would set the power launch on all because it's the figure and then she really kind of just lost him. And he was just looking after his shake and his head he could believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house or nothing really. And he just goes, , you're really, you're really haven't done anything wrong. There's, I can't point any one thing you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven't done anything wrong. We did call you. But I'm just, I just, I can. Thank you for this They call for squirrel in  3,000 or 1,000 dollars I'm just a broken that and it was just all of the thing about five minutes Could that have happened to you now 13 years later? There's always a new mistake to be made. I don't think I would make that particular mistake I mean next for any mistakes make plenty mistakes. That's just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice, but there's such variety that if you're going to make hundreds you're going to make thousands of mistakes. That's really really going to hand more what you're doing. This is interesting. That is a very particular thing, but in the job is that in order to run the job you literally have to make mistakes. There's no way around. Right. And if police work, they afford you punished based mistakes. But these things that just eat to the R&U responsibility. If you get involved with things that are at your responsibility, you're really not equipped to hand, but you don't have a specific plan. A plan that's thought through to a conclusion, you probably should reevaluate what you're doing. Yeah, now that you mentioned that, yeah, that's right. You walk into the house thinking, okay, we get the squirrel. how worried you get the squirrel? What was the best case in the day now? That's a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there if the attic and find this cowards as well and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of a trap and then walk out and feel  you're up but it turns out the squirrel, it was a pure victory for the squirrel, the squirrel definitely won yeah, the squirrel really, it's a pretty badass that is not, that is not what you wanted to be saying at the end of the day now, now, I mean, I, it's a really long time even tell people that , so no, I didn't want to know. , what a bone head I was, cleverest in my job. Disrap with you thought please, but it's gonna be, , the day that you had to do a cap. What I thought it would be was, one adventure after another time. And that sounds childish, but that's sort of what I did, in vision. And then the very, one of the very first days I was on, though he didn't say an 있기 shit, I wouldn't hang on to that. I just one piece of shit. had school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23 I was crossing as kids where I went to the ground school or high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third of fourth part of my life, every week in Hong Kong. It was slush on the ground, my mother drove by and she stopped in the middle of the intersection. She goes, what are you doing? That happened. That's not at all. That's not at all. Thank you. , she just... What are you doing? Mom. I have to have some rest. I put those coffee reviews to be easy. And that's when I started to realize, , hey, this is all about car chases and everything else. Just ... Living at home. Our interview he has two years to retirement is been on the course for eight years. Shitoy, that guy hit my bad up! To my life I scare you emperor, Now close. Lets go and read our blog scaled up video Let's go! Last words, please. Come on. Come on. Coming up, when friends try to act  more than just friends, when corporations try to act  high school freshmen, bad sex, bad radio stations, and the power of a fuzzy naval, that's all in a minute. All of it. It's a public radio and international when our program. Just the striking light rose but you're Tw 내일 brought us Peep Thoo dodge light class. If you can approximate course, you can need a variety of writers. and everyday people come on and take a whack at it. Today's program, first day. Storytile site is arriving on the scene, trying to cut inside us. Earl, and people who arrived at Act 3 of our show, actually, bad sex with Black Hand. How can you do a program that first days with that some story that first day, new relationship, with the story present to Black Hand. Black Hand was guided on for eight years, first in college, and it's part of the Critical Corporation. I don't even saw the buddhist mice gone, not a track. It's exactly a track. But yeah, good features, tall, baby brown here, thank you, girl. But there always seemed to be this kind of beaten holiday to budd. You sat smile, stood strong, pear-shin, is though he would mean clogged by might. Sexually buddcap was an inert object. That perception shows2mationally. one night early, some kind of ghost. But they're not really intimate, but I want to have it according to the movies every Thursday. This movie night tradition that has started by a little dog group and a college of course in those 50 tours 30, carrying up and writing people from the outside. They've left Bud, I am the United States online. No doubt Bud had also tried to leave Bud, I can't even write my name. I tried myself, but it was difficult. I've never been a sort of woman who walks into a room in a micro mini dress. They're a moose to gestag her in proportion, and then just got dead all around. No. My charms are more subtle. I'm the kind of girl guy's fall back off, tireless listener, than you have money, provider of Xanets,  TLAX. And so, he's so held together by gravity. Eight years later by now, it's still fine ourselves sitting. together in the dark and movie theater, clutching separate containers in the pocket, not the same word. Hardly a date. One locked, turned the open door, and the doors are closed. There's the first time we lost. We had a sharp profile in the hand, but relatively clear school. And his hand was classed together on one day, and he was nice too. Suddenly a- phrase popped into my mind. The strong capable hands of blood can't. It's strong. People don't sign. It's this blood to use for sex. So things are getting hot, this is kind of a little more. The coming of our pharmaceutical corporations summer softball week in Florence makes them. Even. So let's see, SummerSaltValk provides weak labor in sector 27 with an excuse to just go up. We're finally back in hats without team names on them. , we'll move for no reason at all. I team, the fly balls, is composed mostly at the four Fs at the salt park universe, skinny guys and doing competitions, elected wise and girl friends, little of a month I wonder today even here. yet, dumb and heated, terminated 2000, increases. The team for them today. No. OK. This is a little known fact about Buggham. He did play a year of junior varsity basketball and college. So what if it was at a small size school with a 57-year-old teacher? So what if Buggham is thrown up to the correct middle of your uses? Point is, in sector, do you solve Buggham is our sbleep? and a damn good looking one too. Here, thank you, Dmd. Skin, lightly, tank, and others. New glasses. God yes. Instead of sad clowns, I'd waste your guts. These are cool, wire rims. Sting, wears wire rims. That steps up to the mound, pulls off his treachery. And his naked torso is... Okay, 33 and holding is the triumphant message here. Although he's no Schwarzenegger, there are definite suggestions of biceps and pacts. More than suggestions, announcements, even not very loud announcements. But the point is, situps are being completed, racketball played, body parts tended to. Secretly and moot. Is it just my third fuzzy male talk? Or is that you? ready, what 6? Where pizza now, talking and laughing, sex is definitely in the air tonight for everyone sector D7. Your sloth music buffs may have swing, people in funny vacuum has warm up against each other. By Camp Anaya, no exception. I need the table, side to side, sweat. just sweat and we're doing kind of a sensual leg things. laugh, kick, laugh, kick. Obviously it's driving him wild. So you want to go somewhere he says, , where it is so loud and wild in here. No one would notice if you tore your own broth and used it as a lasso. My case would be this sexy black brides that don't end the bathroom. Frig... I called, but can't. Away from here. How about your bed? Sounds great. All right. They are using secret code now. But I can't deny our talking. Move it to one. I sense almost by telepathy. He wants to swing by the lucky first, it's pop. We skate effortlessly through the gleaming, luminous and supermarket miles  Torbol, D. Paws calmly, almost worshiped, played before the... last refrigerator cases which present their dramatic pantoramas and thus distos of possible. Hynic do second seem to hear it, lose the fosterness. The whole world is ours, literal, through beer. He chooses, quote, I say, I  it too. I guess we both  it. We both  it. And suddenly. I have a vision of bud, camp, and all together on a Sunday morning, leading the newspaper, drinking our favorite general foods in the international coffee, and Marito Pizolnach, but one move out, and instead of my weekends, Yani kept, I would be spending them with some of them together. First, it was movies. Now it is beer. Soon it will be cars, fake. house's children. This is the vision I cling on to as we return to this condo in Long Beach, drain the beer, move to left over Gala. As I sit in the living room and rub and rub, rub, rub, and drink a bit of soulpower and bud cap talks and talks. empty talks about what else but can't. So sometimes I wonder if I'm really really suited for a career and pharmaceuticals marketing management. I mean, what if my calling is something a bit more and the applied plastic field? We kind of plastics, did you have a mic? Oh, I don't know. Single cell life, puzzle polymer blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah mi mi mi blah blah blah blah me meaning blah blah blah. Me meaning he is making me lose hold of my vision. We need to escalate things to the next level. But I say, let's head a bed. A moon slants in through the shade, transforming everything into mischievous and loves. It is uncomfortably warm and stuffy. That is lying on his bed, folding clothes, face. This is so weird. So after all this time, I know. I said, but I think you're all ... I said I'm the head of the bed. Remove one shoe and then you go. But I kept this on me with M to show. I showed you next. Suddenly, horny can a kind of confused priming robot. We grapple each other  circus bears. But, camps head is buried in my shoulder. He is stroking my hair with his eye. He's heading motions. He can this kind of hummings. He's moving. He's moving. He's moving. I find myself energetically massaging here. his shoulders, I don't know why. Move down, lower back, move down, but it seems invasive to be massaging products of such old friends, so I find myself merely packing them as so in congratulations. Oh, if only we could get that central leg thing going again. And take a lap, take out. But there is no lap. Oh, worry, swamp. How I long for pizza, hot bitch. peparoni, laced by you  on the arts. Sex between two people can be such a low thing. Rimley pushing on, I tear my t-shirt on, revealing my sexy black bra, his cute hat just go wild. And bad-bottles, rubbing his arms. He's both. Still I wait with accusing breasts. If you never see me, please check out my strong red shirt. When I realized that I cannot reach myself to face my breath as an older, terrible dream. They blaze in the darkness  headlights illuminated falseness of all those movie nights. Eventually, by stops rubbing, just lies there with both hands cut over his eyes, so expecting to be flogged. His nostrils quick. Settles. I idea is that we will never speak of the incident again. See each other, or even continue to live in the same state. That man, that we change that we rise the next morning, His V. Echo Asking Z cute baby ! I have ever seen. It is a chaos  babies breath, a polo loop in incarnation, C. L.O. D.A. is all stabbing against each other in friendship counterpoint. Even worse is the car which reads, I saw these flowers and thought of you. Well, no. One thing is for sure. He is not my love but, and this is not me. at age 31, a frantic bouquet, slowly, wheels. The Tendru Tsinglos story, bad-sector Budcamp, is not collecting books. It means America, you're at your home. Is there any other fun books? Just a happy memory. Two years to a man is not in any way. Because I'm gonna kill you. I do. This is the first time I've ever seen. Take it slow, nice and smooth. The love is born of the first world. And love is the most important world. No more pain. This is the... This is real. Too smooth. You look first time, follow me, this one's a huge one. Use from now you'll be glad that you stayed. Don't be scared, don't be shy. You'll all be happy, you'll have the next one. You'll be happy, you'll have the next one. I'm just a little bit scared of you. You sit somewhere. You mean, just enjoy. Because love is so un-stay-ay. Back for, when businesses act  people, we have this case study from Alex von Berg, a radio listener. you, radio listener,  me. This is the right about the first day. It's in denial. It's the first story starts in my car. And I have, I just realized that I have my pre-set station buttons, a range in order of preference. When our set is in search of, go down. And this station number six was the classic rock station mark. Great. And number six is awful. It's just awful. Everyone's in a while that have a good look for books on. And that's why I have... it said. So I hit it and there's that song which I don't know the name of but it's that one that does really show and you can be easy. I think it's an expansive definition of classic rock. So that I think why this is great. And then another song and it's  disco in front or something  that. And I think now something  you're on it so I look at I think the first thing is that somebody is  been messing with my dials  somebody got in my car and  re-arrange my radio station. Pur ig But then I look at the numbers when I was a son. And then I hear this announcement that he took. And it's , you, the new 103.5. Jim and oldies. I think that's a hell. He's a gentleman. ? And you have to keep in mind that the day before this station had been playing an act in the slayer and everyone said, let's open from the basically heavy metal here at the new. And now I'll set them in this. no mention in the middle. It's  the old station was disappeared. You found a new 1035. Chicago's new station for jamming old. No, we don't play. No, we don't play. Now what has happened is that this station had a floor matching and , over the week and they didn't mention it on the weekend. We have it on the same floor. There is no mention of that door. I still remember. people call to get and pick us or whatever. Nothing had been said. And so obviously everybody who's been tuning in for is expecting a classic rock, but they don't want to see market their new station. They don't want to see much new kid on the rock. So what they do is they do what everybody does on the first day. They pretend  something. They want to establish this illusion that they've been around forever so they have these little moments to show up a bit when I was little concerned. where they have people they interview  the man in the screen. Where people are talking about how great Jaminol is. I don't know how wonderful it is to have this station in place, Jaminol is, which is what I'm the radio for! Everybody's talking about the new station at Place Chicago's Jaminol. what you hear the song's fiddling? She's back  you're right there. It's  what do they do? They just start , I guess you're gonna meet. They send a squad of people out to find people who are  actively tuned in. So, of course, that also comes true. They have this book. And if you hear the spot, it's  the sort of desperately, it's  they're trying to hard. And , just be exactly what happens. Trying to fit in too hard. And you're pretending that you've been around for it. And ,  the ropes and it just falls flat. And you spot, it's  what? It's , I'm not gonna... The one that I love is where they have   this is the station Jam holdies and then they have This voice of some of them Jam in all these Here comes more of Chicago's jam in all the new I don't quite understand what it is that is just so ridiculous about that that particular jam in all these But it's just  it's so honest and so long it's just not right. It's just not It's it's just not what somebody would say if they were actually excited that channel. They would never, I can't imagine situation when somebody would authentically be shouting. Jumping all the jambit all the time. What the hell? The jambit all these stuff, probably? I can't imagine where it was. Where it was, here. Ooh what's happening? Cause I only gave him tears. Ooh what's happening? He's  a godnight. Let's try, nothing. I'm hungry. what the station for my underbuckers. And yet, all the behaviors that they are exhibiting on their first day are behaviors that I would exhibit in our microsphere. They are trying to fit in their, they're, they're, , sort of this anxious enthusiasm, false provide out the pretending that they're pretending to have experienced ones and that not experience. and dafin on the way just the thigh puts the fingers and hop on the reggae all my 360 Alex Bond remember Well it's American life, the radio program that cannot resist the dare.
