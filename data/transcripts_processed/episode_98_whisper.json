It is buddies of this. The Becker Trance. Start chanting. And get me out of here. And then here in the middle of the ring starts to shape. His whole body by those. His head lowers his eyes to glassy. He transforms from a loser and somebody who dominates it. He starts to get me out of here. Taking our clothes, not turning off. It'll look our wild silly, but when I get to punch you, I ain't gonna be no taps. It's gonna be all,  a real funny person. And I went and bailed some stuff. I got a name Max Helman, who does this public access to the show of Max and Box. I made this story. He said that in Muhammad Ali's biography, I was said that when he was hit really hard in there, he went into this room, it's not. The room he says it all boxers up. And on the wall of the room, he was matched. And at some point, I only had a fight where he took the real pounding and he entered the room and he got to watch. the masks and you realize that people want the masks on. So we did and he says, that's how we was able to last the round. It's the most natural thing in the world, crunch someone in the face. And it's also the most unnatural. You have to psych up, you have to transform yourself, you have to do something. person to put himself straight into danger and throw the punch. Then, once you become that person, once you become that, then more. WB EZ Chicago, Public Radio International, it's American Library of my regards. Today on our program, growing the first punch. And who you become when you're able to throw the first punch? And how hard it is to stop being person to throw a sentence. So, round one, I would probably say that. Jesus, and I sky from Brooklyn, it swans, white gloves, fight in bars, and I harder to stop. Round two, the goal we go when no woman is gone before, story of someone who finds the thing that means more to hurt than anything in the world is bansy, and why she has to give it up. Round three, fighting this work. A man who, if you're 30 in the morning and a club in Chicago, takes on all commerce, and beats him, and well, and why for him is just a job. in the same way. Round 1. Manning Howard grew up in Brooklyn, and a working class Irish onclad, he worked a fight with the other kids there. And he got fighting, so on soffers of Bowlet, such a committed fighter that, when he got older he became the first person to get suspended from faster college for fighting. And now he's trying to stop, trying to stop being the one who always throws a punch. But moving to that work, into the word the most expensive. Isn't it? He spoke to the Bible. How did he discover whom and who? I'm interested in this. He took this ride. But I never be left lost to the worst fasteners of the life. He gave me the receipt. I gave the ride. And he said, oh, what are you the worst fasteners? Medicated, no, sister. One thing that's another man. I based snap graphic both of them. Oh, these are some characters that I've done. And there's three characters  this. Who's the right to stand up for them? Who's the right to stand up for them? Yeah, you pay me out. You pay me. No, I won't pay you. You pay me out. That was enemy people. Just use your capacity. Yeah, it's fine. But I snap, it's charged. That's a seal, I should be it. That should be it. I should be it. Take the core, take the core out of that. , the doors, the outside. So you are with your ourselves. We'll have a good one. And have it to the memory. So, Sam loved it and Heidi Haley, I do it for him. She. Yeah. I see that it has, because I have co-hosts, so we'll come on. Yeah. Are you a belief fair punishment? I never miss a kid. and we're going to waste my fight and being terrified and being blind and running and running and it occurred to me that the people and they did it. It's a playground fighting, but it's pretty traumatic. Okay, let's leave. Chase the year around 30 feet through the head. You just terrified that well. You're not sure exactly where this is. That somebody said they could be through the head. So you running running, you're going to go to the street called. Then you get caught. getting on the head, it's more than millions, it's earthen for some point. So I'm not going to be the guy being chased the playground with a real chase. And it's much  a relation and what? The real action. Don't have no doubt about this. Let me see. But you think it's... Yeah, I thought if you do. If you can choose to do the guys on the beat, I'm so happy that I've got to sing the guy. The things that I learned early on, where you speak paraphera, where you go out of the night, where a big shoes can end up slorying, and it's okay. Always so long. first punch, punch, and then slow, and the eyes, and that's these, those are, those are, don't bother any other part of the body, or anything. They're telling anybody to fight them, just punch them. spurt for the guy, slowly punch. But it's a hard thing. Yeah. Get to it. No. Because you don't know what's in the happenass. No. Then you get your ass kicked and it's happening a lot. So it's a little punchy, then. , to kick it back, you can't have a dime. You lost that. This is a challenge. This is a challenge. Boy, got it in the sights. We're at the first sight. And it's mostly about 0.5. and if it seems to happen really really pretty never was clear. That's the way I walk, I even see it. And after the first fight I realized that few, you can't even slide everything slow down. You get some scories of that. But things that you have time to think about everything, something called crash. Is what you're looking at, what you're looking at, what you thought. The fight where it is looking at what he is thinking, as it is where his hands are, if he looks, if he is kind of guy who is the first, all that stuff, I will hide where it is. , that is the hurt man, it is scary, but it is hurt man, but it is hurt man, it is hurt man, it is so why are you bringing him back to you? Okay, no. I mean, sure there is, but it is not, it is not, , it is not, , there will be pain, , give up because it is pain. And I've never ever ever eaten bad, not sweet. But bad. So you guys think great stuff work. But the punch doesn't really hurt. It's just the sauce. It's , but that's what I find so nasty. It's just the sauce. It's the sauce. It's the sauce. It's the sauce. It's the sauce. It's the sauce. It takes a lot of energy. It's somebody that hurts a lot. You should be sure it's a lot. that you never more tired. You got to be more good. And it doesn't seem to be any more tired. You get to be. You're in a college bar and somebody's running over there. But flush instead of having those in the house. Steve knocked out by the rugby. So we all got his car drove to the hospital. Which he was seeing Francis on his own. Gipsy. And when stormed the emergency room, the movie double door is screaming at him saying, looking for having feels very, very excitable. And having a pair of blinds, screaming, laughing, saying, It's too hard. Part two, two, three, just gone. The sledge wall, slow. That is big eyes of big, big, big puppy dog eyes. And they speak in the list of this. Take back for somebody who's fine with the set. What do you do? Get them. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? So it's time. Dog, , so it's half. So I have an important. Let's do it. Let's get on. I made it as much as I can to review it. But we called now, and I'm going to fight. I'm going to open the door and say it's screen. It's ... It's ... Anyway, a lot of guys probably don't know what to do. We're about five rugby girls. And having started assaults, which just cited everybody, including actually the rugby choice in France as well. And some point Dennis got upset because he had assaulting his girlfriend. Surst You and rush to have it every man away, , for a whole stupid number of things. But that wasn't a good surprise, because everybody but me and the two of you guys did John left. And the fight had already progressed to a point where we were in the circle of guys about the half, so we were going to be back. Never forget, worse. John Bigel, who's next? We have a guy named Ian by the calls, by the Frope. Listed. Up, over shoulders, and over a bush, where you just see him. Go play. Then, five to the hands, three to the hands, walk away, I'm not sure if you'd find somebody else. But, that was, I remember seeing that. Well, I was getting back of my head, front of my head, pounded this in time, two of the guys. One guy, every time I turned around, face the way to fight him. He got behind me. He personally, about your head. Remember thinking, this is a week of the night, fight, this is perhaps, you get hit so hard, and that's a great thing. Then I heard this, E.C. screen. And the work of the floor, and there was the other job, the smaller the two jobs, and the blood we first had. Jarm's three fingers and arms and blood running from the ground with two arms and legs and Jarm could move and he's hands with me, two arms I was so freaked out by that I walked over and I kicked it, coaching his hands, I was , good Just what? What the hell? Got it! So, me, coach, crazy start. You decide what to do it. And I sort of want to back this. And I thought  we're all the way home. It's just a problem. So I've got this stuff. And stuff. So it came forward and it said, I thought, So that's that forward. It's hard to go. It's hard to have to go in. And it's a problem. It's a problem. I thought, I got a coach. But he popped up. one of those, Bozo, the clown punching dolls. he was on the ground, he was around for a second. What are you saying? Right. Time's closed now. And he just got a compass. And so I turned around for about a week. And I turned up a man and do. I'm visiting a lot of my whose name is Bear. , so much of a billion. Just got me there hard. It's not my head. Turn me on my head and he's up. My face on my side. Right? I'm curved. And then because stood on my head and so stopping my head in the boat and his clothes. So we're a bit rude. So I'm taking gravel. So I got all this key. or programs and that's what's called yourself. Now let's check this out and I'll talk about the third section. Careful. I never think The PH sent it in a publishers ringer press it  this and we get the reason that there's super You never spoke that, but we all... God, God, God. If you  there's some fights to watch. It's just , I mean if you're a bar, you're a consumer, so it's good. Right? That's just... that's funny, man. So, we used to do that, we used to fight with each other. , John broke a chair over my head, that was my back, and I was getting up, so I didn't even have any of that. And it was fine. , it was part of the... it was part of the... Fun and everything, . We decided to have a fight in the program, I put them in the program, and I couldn't see them anymore. We were gone and it was a place that small. I really, really, really, really feel bad about myself. Thanks for doing that. I'm just supposed to just do the same thing. That's the point of the program. To be having that way. We'll have fun. See you. So, you feel  I mean, you have to do it one more time. You feel , no, you're doing it. You feel , no, you're doing it. I mean, I have the so-called accomplices, and I think have been going to do that, but I couldn't have, I would be satisfied with that, and I'm sorry if I had never done a vide gone from , running away to finding the solution for the problem. I'd always be running away for one, just counting on the other, see that some problem. And one time, it does, and one time, it does. Yes, what offer did I? We are now alone. So that's so e. And now you still have to use a fillet for far enough as characters being clearly the idiot. You take the screen. You feel good. I don't know. Part of me would  to say yes definitely. Part of me goes the same time. In fact, I would  to say that I wanted to find a turn the other cheek. It's okay. I start that work. It's time for the 14th. What are you doing? I'm not. I'm trying to show you. I started. I started. I didn't. I always thought it was the end of this episode. I mean, I've only had a bit of such issues. I'm not sure. That I was from. So, I was just... I was just... I was just... And that special time to find the zupu guy who worked. We have a neighbor. Neighbor. He has a dog, a dog, a dog, a big screen, he's a big screen, a man, a dog, and then his behavior as a neighbor is our race. So that's, he should be punished. But I can't punish him. I'm not the one who's going to be punished. So I'll be that soon. I want to think about this particular incident very little time when. for the Fed to stay at will. For a group last or something, and then create situation, God, who's dead, and I obviously did it. And  I did, I lost for all of my righteousness, for people, false excuses, stop, do it, all of them. That sounds awesome. Love the idea of it now. No. But I know that course you can start. So we're just going to keep going around and so I was , well I found everything. So that's nice, me. I let it know that I just proved to have it. Stop. You're a bunch of things just go on. It's true, yeah, it's the second one. No quick resolution. Many Howard Stillos and Brooklyn were erased a column of Fars with New York Press and does other writing. He talked to the American Life Senior Editor of Paul Tom. My son is struggling, having a shoot. is burning. Hard, eat that apple! Last time on the Fourth of July, the American Region Hall used to set up a box in Great, and on Aegwak, hundreds of people watching. The citizens of Pudiyat were played, their great kids, fifth grade kids, and adults, hearts of adults. They called it Rapphouse Boxing, radio producers Nikki Sylvie and David Nalson, hidden systems, which years back. A lot of these were sort of breadch and matches that had built up on fish, boats, all season and people kept very well on fishing boat. They took it out and had successful run. So it's on each eight for July and we'll look at something. These are people on Pai Theron players? Yeah, I told us about fighting Zomboss. And that he given us boss two black guys, but the heater was at heart attack, and we're giving his boss two black guys. And he had to get to the hospital, but a couple of hours and he wanted to be the captain, who was it? Well, we need some more people on our players. Women preferably little kids in the seat of the tape or hearing that MC of the boxing event urged different couples that he knows are having parents trolling to get in the Recome on Roxanne come on Jack get in the ring Joan You and Roxanne you did that All right, I'll go We know it was kind of an all purpose kind of a cleansing I have always called me a young couple of loves. Because it's not so many. I was raised with what young couple was. I mean, let me just say, young people is the Jewish holiday. You had to attend for your sons and you had to, at least, forget. You might not forget, but you gotta get over. You gotta move on. You gotta work it out. That one day to do it. So it is. great too because it was sort of  the block party gun. Why? I'm talking about the block party with cells. , the crowd fed it and the crowd was, they were  hungry for, , for the game, nothing to sport. All around us, connotating practically grabbing the microphone to give you a sense of everything. Look, they're just a way. Look, they're , I'm walking in some man. They got out and I want to see them out of my room. Did I? I don't know how to say this. what this puts to shame is  judge law, people's court. that's what you want to see. What you want to see is this. this, this is what on TV. You think this would be just  a huge thing where  two people who have a grudge, , come before, , whoever the host of the show is going to be. Let's say, George Form. , and he's he's the referee of the match. He's the judge law player at the same. And , and then the two people will come before and they both would sign some sort of liability form. They'd  to have their own uniform. go on and just  the people's court then they would explain what their little TF was about and then we'd watch them do, can I? And it would be called the people's ring. The people's ring. Seriously, when you think about this, do you think this would be a healthy thing? More people had this bond. But do you think this would be a healthy thing? I do think it would be a healthy bear with some Mickey's ring now. I know, I think it would be a good thing. I know, people. I don't know, I don't know, I can't see. Look, I'm not going to start the committee too. Let's spread rough ass boss. Let's do a marathon. But I'm not arguing for violence and not defending violence. I just think can't deny the violence inside those people. I'm not arguing for violence. Music Nicki Sylvan Davy Nelson, kind of 30-xtop rough hot spots in years ago, because of insurance reasons. There's no way to prevent lawsuits that squid eyes and busted noses. There's insurance companies ruining our great American traditions. Music Coming up, girl meets ring, girl loves ring, girls, leaves ring, sort of. and boxing is a job, it's in minute, a public radio information, aint hard. This American light margaris, each of the different questions is being the person first question. And what happens to you when we become the person? And our hardest is to stop being. To be righted I too of our show, round, to go to go when that woman is gone. Let this story, I'm loving to fight. words. Words who was in the count, the financial analyst at a huge insurance company. She was living day-to-day,  anybody else. Then she heard about this box in class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching. Words alike sports, she'd even taken in a robot box in class before, so she decided to go down and shoot it out. Here I am with the suit coming in, though it was the first time I had to get out of my chart and changed. Am.... Well, I know, I mean, it's a boxing. So, and how do you press? , it's a secret. She's so sure. I want to get rid of my stomach and I want to get rid of my gut. So, she was so sure. I looked at her, and I teach boxing. , boxing in the low-business, arrow boxing is... This is boxing. You want to have a box, you can be , You want to come and dance around the ground, so you're not allowed to go to the guy for the same, which you want. He wasn't even thinking about me. There's another girl who thinks he's a rock. I mean, that little project is not there. You think that? You're hot, you're hot. That big of a project goes well. Who's the little bot? You're too stiff. That's me. I'm a detail of the ball. Shine your practice  a normal human. I'll show up. And then he made me laugh. I thought he was a music. I thought he was a music. It would be funny. It would be funny. What in your own movies? And this guy's telling me I'm  a no-one show. And the guy's got that. So I started working with , everyday we come down with the pants. I'm getting a combination of such fellow filming in the place. So I was , well, I said, if I can bring you to the mall, Jim and book, so he can bring me to the city boat. She was the fan, I got any. But what I got you doing right now, so I'm going to be right now. So that was definitely the quote of the fight. Every day after working Manhattan, Marissa would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train three or four hours of Milton's gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She'd grown up in the projects, put herself in college, gotten an MBA, called a good paying job, and where she was, back so close to the streets. When she got a broken nose and black eyes and ring, she lied to me and called me to see that. didn't talk if she was boxed. Preparedants didn't approve of women fighting. They were conservative born Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorex infected with HIV or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed. Marissa was the only girl with illness. His first girl, such as Spire with a men there. She took daily one day and she was told, nonstop, combinations and punches were just the old men sitting. down chair. And that was the process of his head. So when she finished, he came over and asked when he wanted to fight up with us . And he played with us. He was , what kind of a guy? And then I ate with you. I said, oh, God, who was? Who did that guy? He was , oh, God. I know man, bro. It's good. It's good. But the words that come in, he came over and knew. So I said, hey, get out of here. Listen, look at your grown up, look at those. Oh, look. Looking at Maritz and you probably wouldn't think of boxing. She's small, she's over five feet tall, and only one hundred six miles. Her features are fine, delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her. She's ready. It's  speaking to someone who's had a religious conversion. python一点. in this light. I just think this is  this is. So this is what I was putting it for. Ladies and gentlemen, the night check started to win us 100 chip sound blast to let me teach them the auto. In the jazzo corner, a litter of oil from the Supreme Team Bucky Club. A while we were in financial handling and in fort-time hospital trainer. Thank you. with Nelson's training, Maritza was in beatable. Within a year, she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metro's The Empire States, in a 96-she won the biggest hall. The Golden Gloves and Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest blasters in history and thought. She was straight left and wide wide. She was straight left and wide wide. Meritza and I get together to watch the video from 96 Golden Loves Win. The garden is packed, the crowd's going wild. Meritza is incredibly fast and beautiful and warm. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She's couch. But woman she's fighting is tall of machines, with longer arms, summer rits of ducks down low, jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands with punches to the ribs, then to the chest. And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Meritza is up, giving her a fierce cup. the nation to face the hand. They go, they go, they're up there. They go, they're little bit right. Ow! Another one to the body. Another one, another one. And another one to the body. We've got it. We've got it. In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch. Straight to my little sister's face. Moritz stumbles back. And then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations in the crowd of screaming. And then you go, they go, they go. Oh, and second! Yeah! There you go! Oh, go! There you go! There you go! There you go! No! And this is that. But I'm full! Oh, come on! That's a good thing! It's so cool! Oh, my God, you are so good, Marissa! I wanted to fight so bad! After the fight ends were laughing. We keep reminding you to watch Marissa's in these accounts. We're both completely high in St. We're at the space as transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way it's terrible because we both know she's quitting box. We're at the wants to grow pro. The doesn't seem to be any way she can make a living box. She's only 100-60 pounds. They don't even have a name from her way of class. If she went proud, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her. As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she's always been put up against the same to her promise, over and over, and she's speaking every time. Merit's lucky enough to have found that things she loves, the thing that makes her life compete. But unlucky enough that the time it worked out all wrong. More women are getting the time, the starting young. In 10 years there may be enough women that were dancing would be able to make a career, but she's already her third in this. She says she has to be realistic for future. So she's gone back to school and she's working full time. I'm not, I get this feeling,  what I'm going to do. I want to do it. what I'm going to do? what I'm going to do? what I'm going to do? I'm going to tell you something is out of the alley. It's , , it's that. what I'm going to do? Nobody's seen on the outside and was treated. He was sad to say, yeah. It's  she's in love with someone she knew as she lost her room. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one night's hands. Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metro's turn and ended up telling him. On the night of the fight, the callers from Ringside, and told her they were holding the match for her. Ritzie got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn. Oh, Milton. lied to the judges about Marissa being stuck in trap. She arrived, beat her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself refighting when she was trying to retire, that she left without even collecting the trope. But being back in the game fought too good, and after that win, she just couldn't bring herself to walk away. Despite a reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York gloves, and of course won. For his part, nothing happened to her. Marissa will always be his best friend. first but he's now becoming the science in fact she doesn't have much time at the box. The box is a two-poor of the Amash with the Masha in her front and she slates, smiths, being cement, she has it really good to get to the house and get that beauty to hand out the beauty. , I wish I would have found it was she was a little bit young. A lot. Years how hard this is from Ritz. Even her plans for retirement. box food box. She's training to be in the search therapist to the search box for she says she quit her job as an account and now works full times a trainer in a gym. She has this theory that she'll get over boxing and going box and that's a lot of time. Maybe I will become it by being there. No, that's what I'm doing. It's the basic. The basic fact is, I'm not doing anyone. They're not going to boxing. Do that's what I need. And February, just after Maritz and this is the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton's gym to superfight. Even though these days Maritz isn't there much anymore, Milton is promising for Maritz's will spar with New Girl this trip. We wait and wait and then listen, and our passes. When she finally shows she looks worn out and tired, she's not dressed up, she's such a disgusting flu. She's not gonna put it right away. It's not supposed to push me. What's this? What? Yeah, I got nothing with me. Everything. You're gone. And I'm not even. She says she didn't bring her shoes. She doesn't have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner. Says the Versaise. Suddenly, my words, it looks entirely. But I gotta say it, no more. Then more, it's a drop to the pretense. We head down in the elevator to the car. Turns out she's been carrying it. loves from now on these wraps all of her putting in her cards for the past year. Just in case. This is gonna come right away. I don't wanna come. You gotta be a smiling. You're not gonna be so happy right now. Because I love watching it, but it's , let's get to where I'm at today. It's very, very happy and very nice, I guess. So, all right, let's go. Wanna continue? 撤ち邪cond third and 112 T5. So, hey, hey, hey, we know boys, go ahead and order for one of those pot. Is that crazy? That's crazy. She grabs her bag and breaks back to the gym. And as my roots are getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on the chin and I'll come in. Milton's stands rings on the pump top, ready to see his favorite action. This is how it does so a lot right here from Supreme to Fox. I should show it with a little bit of a lack of a show with a little bit of a lack of a show with a type. Really good. Right, so stiff at first, then she starts to relax. She's ducking down dancing on her own. And in the last 10 seconds it will fight, she's a surge of energy, she's punching her, moving dance for a non-stop combination. And afterwards she's pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with milk and then the guys in the gym. She says she'll be back to sparring training every week. And even though she's missed the deadline for this year's Golden Bloss, she swears off to the glove next year. Stay tuned for 1999. She's not so state-to-date. But Moritza doesn't show it, no one's the most. Or the weak actor. She breaks to appointments with me. She doesn't return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she's saying, angry, she fought again. Scared, she's getting stuck back in. And how about the fact that you're still playing there? Here. , there's a thing that I go back in it. Maybe it's basically ... It's  always knowing that it's always there that I'm obviously far behind in this open front mirror and house everything is there and you're down and you're moving. , it's it's my connection to my. So I'm very happy. I'm very disappointed. I see for that I hope loves in my car. I love it. It's it's me. That's great by names with all that. That energy film that you're in in your lost classes. Ground 3, Hardware. But, so far, in our program, we've heard people who love being person, person, person, and official fighters and managers. This is a different kind of story. We're shooting your back to the Olympics, twice, one silver and bronze medals. in Florida State Golden Club Champ, Fortyne National Golden Club Champ. In a year ago he quit amateur fighting, so he was in a friendly living convox. It's kind of jobable people try to hit and injure you for a living, but you get no help in charge. In a year of Frankies had a broken rib broken ankle broken hair. A scolopal or ear that's gone untreated. And he's not officially even gone pro-yet. He spoke with the American wife of this piece. Franky Cruz got his job from one punch. A year ago in the nightclub in my hand, the 170. Frank, knocked out a guy away in 260 with a right hand. This says the punch brought everyone to the feet, including a middle-aged dance club of Ushikaka named Rubin Pazimu now. That night Rubin had a vision for his chopper cannon club, and it revolved around Frank's troops. Later that week, Frank is on the plate of Ushikaka. I came and I didn't listen. They wanted to pick me up as a man. I destroyed the occupy floor. They drew me that nice way. It was fun. No. It's 2.30 in the morning of the tropical can, a Latina nightclub that houses four bars of VIP room, a restaurant, and a huge dance floor with a balcony. It's 2.30 in the morning nearly a thousand people are packed, saw on a tube. after the weightlifting contest and after the lip syncing and after the four Roddy dance or finishing sawging the shirtless man with baby oil there's boxing and regulation ring set it in middle of the dance floor it's fight and stars welcome to it's very the 5 foot 10 that grabbed one horned fighter with died blonde hair and a broken nose. He's not yet dressed in his boxing hair. Instead he wears a mustard colored sports coat, slacks, and so much jewelry literally makes him noise. Here's Frankie's job. Here's the job that his kids handle. It's free fall box. Anyone. You can fight. I can fight. All you have to do is sign a release for the green that if your nose breaks, teeth get punched out or you end up with a mild concussion. what's your fault for being too drunk, because you'll encourage by your friends to get into a box of your first business. You can choose to fight your best friend, your nemesis, or you can take your chances and fight for him. If you knock down Frankie, you get a thousand dollars in cash, or the mysterious grand prize. Everything's in cash. The first guy I've been he was wow. He did not want that one. He did not want it go down by the, , he finally created the second one. I know one came bigger and every time bigger and bigger. Thank you, fight anyone, science and. Sometimes he's boxed five or six matches in one night and incredible features, something no pro boxed with every deal. And Frankie gets paid Sig whether he fights one guy for five guys. He's fought with one arm type behind his back. He's fought three guys at once. He's fought in awe 120 fights in the truck. He's one hundred and one seven. Frankie wants to say how much he gets paid, but it's not much. And he says he sends most of that money back to his ex-wife, his three children, and his grandmother in my am. So he's broke all the time. For the first seven months he was in Chicago, Frankie lived in background with the truck. piano. He also worked as a bouncer, and I had some fun in boxing. So for days on and, Frankie never left club, sometimes on a Saturday or Sunday with the business office closed, Frankie would be locked inside and would have to wait for the tropical piano to open in order to leave. He says he didn't mind at that much, and so Rubin, the owner, who took his television set away, in order to start in training season. Hi guys, hi everyone. What's I in fry? And say, why are you doing this? This, this, this, not. So, I'm, I think I'm not getting paid enough to do it. Every since business. If you don't talk business to, you don't tell this a bit to, you will never fight. Make it. Two, two, three, Two, three, One, two, three, Right now, two African-American guys from the audience signed up to fight each other and going that and bring both way well with two-in-house. While the clumsily stumble around the brain taking wide punches and falling against the ropes, the almost pre-team-looking brain goes, good instructions, and what they're supposed to do with the brain. The girls in Tharnbeckini's hustle around the French emerges. Now we're in the blue and gold running suit, struck how well it had, and the liquor oddwood scarred the tightments. Thank you. Thank you. Franky stands with the announcer relative ring girls walk circles, each holding an empty championship belt. The belt always gets the center spot line. One training, Franky lays the belt down next to us. and says a prayer and starts rep. It's on the floor next to it, on this jump rope. Once when I showed up to interview Miss Jim, before we could go off to the top, he opened his gym back and pulled out a little plastic stand with some pretty pretty frames. He put the stand on a desk facing the front door of the gym and put the little cover. I wanted to build a straight snake on the other, Viva Auto Sales Part, because, unfortunately, the Trapper Cannon didn't give me the belt. We had too many doodzzers here so nobody can use this glue because I wanted to take a try and some cool part. So, I looked at everybody's picture in her video. but we didn't want to meddle reaction that nearing up the reality! we noticed five rings at the crossroad, only across the entire car . several months, Frankie says he can suddenly ask for one, correct, correct, kept going on. I just saw I had a list to get a part so that you're in the club. I've been talking about him. I've been looking for him, especially. So when I wanted to get a bell for him, I wanted him to with this. He would never got there. And so he is , oh, he's going up. Okay. Instead of friend introduced Frank's owner, Viva Autos house, the guy agreed to buy the belt for Frank to be a name on. It's a good and best. You need Franky. You need the belt. Leaving the belt with the ring girls, Franky climbs between the ropes and gets in the spawner. His manager's Danny and Tika, they're looking for the remaining leg of crap. The Gidmah place to live, they see the Yates' right, doesn't drink and trains every day. Frankies upon it doesn't look too insurmountly. Staggering hanners to bring where in jeans, alongside green shirt and dark marks, he's at least 240 pounds, who played over her and got loved in those. It would take a lot of alcohol to make someone  this believe her lungs and the brim looks trained on what the metalists, but he's half a lot about alcohol. size up the gun. The fact that he's dropped means the sliding may be sloppy, but it also makes a hard drive frankly because the drone's felt built pain is much. As the bell goes off, thanks screams and scratches can park. Frankie's played against the ropes, in a shocking move Frankie's opponent came racing out of the corner and immediately danced swimming. It's a bar fighter's tactic, it in first touch. He gets Frankie against the ropes, in the corner and not. It's Frankie Owen now just to get it. But Frankie Owen, hey go! Those are the ones who are wrong! I never occurred to me how hard Frankie would have to work when it's five. How much of a beauty takes, it'll it's time. What am I supposed to do? I'm a poor! I'm so poor! I'm so poor! At the end. the first round, hanging down the castle frame, one. Mostly it's big part of the time. You're the cheer. You're the cheer. Right, guys. Hey! Somebody's coming back to you! Take it back! You're the one who made a great plan on the monster! You're the one who made a great plan on the monster! And round two of the frames, is the promise of punches in the beginning. at times in the spring, and almost a champion. Frankie edges the guy against the ropes in his own corner, and as Armonish's, turns head, pounds away at what spurts everywhere. It's an incredible moment, satisfying way I never would have guessed. So at and spit, fly off, Frank and his body, hand can get in the wild, the crowd goes wild. Frankie breaks the guy's nose and the reference, fight. When Frankie's saggers back and drops. and the kids, the ledger from the clubs onto the starched black man. Thanks, friends. All right, that's the beginning! I  the one that you want to run for! It's the out of you! It's the out of you! Boxing can make you feel so small, the force of the punch is so brutal and penetrating that it's almost mythical. When Frankie climbed out of the break, he asked me to pose a pass. I couldn't even answer. I couldn't talk. In only a few minutes, the sky who has to beg for a belt is carduer Vamos I've asked Frankie open and over what he loves about box and doesn't know the same thing. He doesn't  hurting people. He doesn't have any romantic ideas about the tradition of box or it's a primal of PR. That's not mind boxes. It's a job. A job that doesn't pay to be able to actually grow in the punishable or in the punishments. I never whisper at, but that isn't going to matter, Mr. If you want. To want in the next special for French, this is France. When I love the Robotics, it's a period. I said, people don't go to you. They won't be fun. I believe that people even have their children for me, they're doing for me. But after I went, after I finished the fire, I know. I got all those people who didn't share for me. He won't be mid-airhand. I don't think. Wow, you had a quarry fight. After his match, Frankie wins jumping round, running through the grabs. Up to the top four, and then he goes. He does this every time. Thanks. One frankly sees me, the staffs and motions can move the ball. So I can support him, which is the groundwork. I'm very happy. Now, baby, grab the place. Bro, get him being better, baby. I got a better bet of two. Yeah, I got a bet of two. That's right. Go on. I'm not  I'm pretty good at this thing. , I'm , Captain, I'm not  it. Out of the rain looking for attention, Frankie doesn't seem to be drawing more. He's a god, white sheep. A lot of people come over, she's a six-year-old, a lot more pressure in writing, and in that picture, which six women from the audience to not to part in do it yourself, strip teams.
