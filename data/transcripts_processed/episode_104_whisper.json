Welcome to WBE, Easy Chicago Public Radio International. To America. Life on my right glass. Coming to you today from the Yearbook 1 of Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California. Thanks to the Public Radio Station KQD and San Francisco. Today on our program, Music Lessons. What's frustrating about them? What's miraculous about them? Heck one. Papa was not a Rolling Stone. David Cedaris, Gelswood happens when a parent does not play an instrument, and it's a city's children cake lessons. Heck two.

Thank you very much. So imagine that you're in a belt, and you decide you want to express your sub through music. And the medium that you have to express yourself is 13 and 14 and 15-year-old kids. That is a very imprecise. medium in which to apply your heart. This week was especially hard on throughout. He had to get one group of kids rehearsed the same at one graduation ceremony and another group ready for another graduation ceremony and the most saddles to do. Then the gospel choir who usually is pride and joy kids sort of fell apart on it. They were singing badly and arguing with them. Satin down, he told him he was probably going to have to cancel their last concert with the year. But he would decide about it. If the one last rehearsal. I'm just , I'm just , look, I'm tired.

Now we just said to get through two graduations, they're concert and a couple of recitals and you could have the summer to promote his new CD which  any real professional musician Yes, need to mention here on the radio. That's it. Echoing. Papa was not a rolling stone. Such an arrest of the unlipped lives of the parents, nowhere more than news glasses. They're the eager to use the students, and then they're the reluctant use the students. This is the story of somebody in second. Who's welcome to David's house. Thank you. My father loves jazz and has a substantial collection of records and real-real tapes. He used to listen to after returning home to work. He might have entered the house in a foul mood, but once he had his dexter Gordon and a vodka martini, everything was beautiful, just beautiful. The moment the needle hit that record, he loosened his tie, came something other than Pam Remember To uncomfortably, comic book public Book Book title Jack Kladin Sahib with a pocket full of IBM pencils and boss with the word bank. Man, oh man, will you get a load of the chops on this guy? I saw him once at the blue note and I mean to tell you that he blew me right out of my chair. You could take a hatchet and cut the man's lips right off his face and still he would have played better than anyone else out there. That's how good he was. I'd nod my head, envisioning a pair of lips lying for... or say it on the floor, some gas room room. The trick was to back slowly towards the hallway, escaping into the kitchen before my father could yell, hey, get back here, where do you think you're going? Sit down for a minute and listen, I mean really listen. How could you prove you were listening? It was as if he expected us to change color, the fuzz colored ceramic rabbit or neighbor used to get the weather. I often thought that my father... mother might have been a musician himself, had he not been bored in immigrant parents he considered even waxed tip shoe lace being extravagant. They listen to only to Greek music and not see more on as far as the rest of the world for skin cells. Jazz was in a sense my father's own personal discovery. Denounced him for bitten by his parents, he hid his 78s and secretly drove into New York City where he'd see it alive and enraptured since he was two. removed to North Carolina and was difficult, and that he felt cut off with nothing but the country. Top 40 radio stations, Raleigh had to offer in a mid to late 1960s. Limited to his record collection, it became his dream that his children might fill the void by some day for me jazz combo. His plan took shape shortly after escorting my sister's Lisa, Gretchen and I, to the local state university, to see Dave Bruebatt, who was currently touring with his sons. The audience ward when Dave blew back step-forced from behind the curtain, and I sat back, pretending those applause were for me. A person had to do something while standing before a crowd of 600 people, and with this in mind, I'd been secretly working up a little routine. The act consisted of me, dressed in a nice shirt and tie, and performing a medley of commercial jingles in the voice of Billy Holiday. From my Rawley show, I'd probably... open with the number used for mode our towns all the shopping center. A quick nod to my accompanies and I begin with the excitement of Cameron Village. We carry you away. The beauty of my rendition was that it captured by the the joy and the sorrow of a visit to Alice Purb, so JC Panis. This would be followed by such surefire hits as a theme for Winston cigarettes and the catchy new coat commercial. I'd  to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd  to buy the world of coke and keep it company. I was lost in my fantasy. Ignoring Dave Rubeck and coming up for air only when my father elbowed my ribs to say, are you listening to this? These cats are burned in the paint right off the walls. Driving home from the concert at that night, he drummed his fingers against steering. He'll say, did you hear that? The guy just gets better every day. There he was with his kids. A whole lot of them jamming up. storm. What I wouldn't give for a family  that. You guys should think about putting an act together. The following afternoon he bought a baby grant piano. It sat in a glad that until my father signed Gretchenop for a series of lessons. Lisa was assigned to flu and I returned home from a scout meeting one evening to find my instrument leaning against the aquarium. So there she is, my father said, here's that guitar you always wanted. Surely he had me confused with someone else. While I had regularly petitioned for a brand named Vacuum Plano, I'd never said anything about wanting a guitar. Nothing about her to peel to me. I had my room arranged just so and I didn't fit in at all the nautical feet. I stuffed it into my closet. and they're remained until he signed me up for private lessons. But I'm sick, I yelled, watching him pull out of the parking lot. I don't want to play an instrument. Don't  anything? I love my guitar and the music shop where the manager read me to my teacher, a temperamental midget in the music romantine. A facidious dresser stuck in a small town. Mr. Mancini wore clothing, and recognized young boys departing in Hudson Bells. Some night he favored button-up shirts with clip-on ties, while other evenings I arrived upon him dressed in flaired slacks in a snucked curdle-mix sweater, a swag of lovely tangy from his neck. His arms were manly and covered in coarse-dark hair, but his voice was high and strange, as if it had been recorded and played back at a higher speed. My fascination was both evident and unwelcome. He didn't ask my name, just lit a sick. and squint it against the smoke. my father, Mr. Manzini assumed that anyone would  to go on. He had picked it up during a single summer, spent in what he called Hot Plana, TA. Now that he said, is one classy city. what I mean? The girls down on Peach Tree are running wild 24 hours a day. That's great, I said. He seemed to know that I was nothing special, but just a tight, another boy who's father had his head in the clouds. What else? Let me show you what this instrument's all about. He climbed into his chair and began praying right my fire. The current top 40 version was performed by Jose Feliciano. A blind man whose plaintiff voice served the lyric much better than Jim Morris, who sang the song and what I considered the boss and seated down the voice. There was Jose Feliciano, Jim Morrison, and then there was Mr. Mancine. Who played beautifully, but sang  my fire as if he were a weeb-low scout, so she for a match. He finished his opening number, nodded his head in acknowledgement of my applause, and moved on, performing his own unique and unsettling versions of the girl from mepanyma, and little green apples. While I sat in my seat, I felt smiles. I read so tight I lost all feeling my jaw. My fingernails had grown a good three inches by the time he hit his final note and called me closed pointing out a few simple chords. Before leaving he gave me some purple, nimi-agrap and outs which he both knew. Back at the house my mother had my dinner warming me up. From the living room I could hear the ameless whisper of Lisa's flute which sounded much the wind whipping through a mountain pass. Down in the basement, Gretchen was either practicing piano, or the cat was chasing a month across the keys. I was at the mall with my mother afternoon when I spotted Mr. Mancini reaching up to order a hamburger at Scotty's Chocwag. An open-air fast-food restaurant located a few doors down from the music shop. He was standing on his tiptoes and even then his... failed to reach the counter. Once he got in his food he carried his trade towards a vacant table facing the escalator. The passing adults shifted their gaze with smiled politely, while their children were decidedly moral hurt . Toddlers ambled up on their chubby boat legs embracing my teacher with their catch-ups near fingers. It suddenly became clear that Mr. Mancini made a joke. The only thing worse with the adolescents, the boys my age. sat at the surrounding tables, poking fun and regruging Kate, Scotty flies and laughter. Watching this scene from a distance, my first thought was, hey, that's my niche at hands off. The man was my discovery, not theirs. I'd only thought of him as a pocket playboy, but watching in Dipishanberger into a puddle of mayonnaise, I brought in my view, and saw him as a vulnerable loner, an outsider who scoff, not only at Rawley, but at the entire state. Carolina. It was a persona I thought of adopting myself. Looking at it this way, it seemed that Mr. Mancini and I actually had quite a bit in common. We were both men trapped in voice bodies. There was no reason I shouldn't address him, not as a teacher, but as an artistic brother. If things worked out the way I hoped, maybe I could even use his might accomplices. If all we need to do is show up for my lesson and this time when asked if I I told the truth, saying in a matter of fact, tone of voice that no, I had not touched the things that's the last session. I told him that I had absolutely no interest in mastering the guitar. What I really wanted to do was seeing in the voice of the Billie Holiday. Mainly commercials, but not for any vans or art dealerships because those are usually correlations. The color EPS from my teacher's face. I told him I'd been working up an act and could use a little company. And I think he said he was just the girl that was masks, the boys, the product, painted, and the same . Yet by course he did the same. But he didn't work on those pictures. He'd know the jingle for the new Sarah Lee campaign. He acted as though I'd instructed him to do something on speak with reverse. He want me to what? I was certain he was lying when he told me he didn't know the tune. Government, dumb, rits, crackers, the themes for out-to-seller and ten more appliances. He claimed ignorant on all accounts. I knew that it was queer to sing in front of someone, but seeing as he'd been doing it for weeks, I started in on an acpello version of the latest op. for my or commercial. Hoping he might join in once the spirit moved. With a total disregard for his company, I sang the same way I get a comb when alone in my dead. My eyes shut tight in my hands. Move useless crippled fashion. My baloney has a first name. It's OSCA. My baloney has a second name. My name is Emmy. I E R Oh, I love to eat it every day And if you ask me why I'll say Then ask me why I have a way With your willows Amen I reached the end of the tune thinking he might take this as an opportunity to applaud or maybe even apologize for underrestment. But instead he held up his hand saying, hey guy, I'm not into that. There were plenty of screw balls  you back in Atlanta. And I don't know, I guess it's your thing, whatever, but you can definitely count me out. My father was disappointed when I told him I wouldn't be returning for any more lessons. Luckily, my sisters were as fat officers I was, and we approached them together saying sederous trio had officially dismantled. He offered to find us better teachers, adding that if we were unhappy with our instruments, we could always trade them in for something , the Trumpet or saxophone or hey, hold out the lights! He reached for a Lionel Hampton album saying, let me play you a little something, I think you're gonna love. You told them no dad don't thought it's still he ready to stare at him, hold it! the record of life and examining the adults. I'm telling you that this record is going to change your life. And if it doesn't, I'll get each one of you five dollars. How do you  that? It was a tough call. Five dollars for listening to a long-anven album. You get we knew that they were certainly strings attached. We looked at each other, my sister died, and then we left the room. Failing to respond. See ya'll. Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back in here and listen. We joined our mother at the TV network fan. The music was his great thanks, not ours. That night as was his habit, our father fell asleep and jumped scary. The record making its pointless silent rounds, he laid back and so precious. As told by, put our music on, we had more of that music that would have been out of detail. Who can we be ? The National Astronomy because we communicate every two decades... ...in the early years. And our team and ZeAllia do not change. To be honest, the spark of love and fans become appreciative for all. We have all that stuff that will help others be friends. which today is the offer of several boats, but the story is naked just cannot hit the bat. Coming up, Sarah Val Marches and Lamott praise, it's been a minute, public radio and conational, point out, program continues. This American light from my request, keep an effort for questions. That's right, it's the greatest function of that game today. You're going to want to send up to the arts and sentences to perform. Today's program music lessons, so it makes it so great, so terrible, we really, really really provide them to a program to how to execute this player. As a teenager growing up in Montana, Sarah Valt was not casual enough, so she was not reluctant to use an even right to use a marching band band once the edges had been in the quarter of the year. And the buzz in the quarter of the song. See how I'm music- and one of our community editors in the spirit hall. Please welcome. It was autumn in America, fine hot Indian summer day. Pretty high school girls sat on bleachers with the sun shining on their pretty hair, watching handsome high school boys play football. And then it was half time, which is where I came in. I was standing in line in my silver spats down past the end zone waiting to go on. I was in 11th grade. I was in March and Bands. I had a foot tall fake fur black hat with the vaguely processed food name Shate Go strapped under my chin. But not only prevented me from breathing, it prevented me from balancing. So that even though my job was to march around is some kind of sick metaphor for teenage very precision. I moved through time and space with the grace and confidence of a puppy walking on a beach ball. Because of my double shortage of strength and coordination, I barely passed him. But somehow I was supposed to lift a baritone horn that measured twice my body weight, and blow into it while reading microscopic sheet music. Step in. Straight line while remembering left foot on B-1 is 3 right foot on B-2 and 4 and maneuver myself in a few visual formations  the trio of sticks they hear when we play the key of my piece on. And then halfway through the halftime program, I helped break formation drop my bare tone horn on the field and sprint to the B-R line. along call with everyone in the band, everyone in the bleachers, everyone on the sideline, watching and waiting. Highland and still. Then I picked up my knowledge. This is what they had been waiting for. As I left phone solo on a little Latin flavored number, Tico Tico. My polo shirt, clad Nemesis, and E.E. stood up in the stand screaming, MTH Oh, woo, woo! As the laughter of his friends at me drowned out the horn section. This was the same end to keep I might add who earlier in the week in music history class had delivered an oral report on Chikoski's mistress and referred to her as Nini throughout, even though her name was Nodchen. Andy Heep, Andy Heep was apparently smart enough to publicly humiliate me during T.C. He just wasn't smart enough to know the abbreviation MMP. period stands not for me but the title, my dog. Anyway, I only had a second to stick out my tongue and Andy when I finished because I had the let go of the mallet's brush over to my baritone. Again, the freeze frame spectators the loneliness of the long-distance runner. And I'm back in formation with the low brass with the analogy. And I was getting academic credit for it. I was getting great in to wear that uniform to play those songs. Which back to the question, what exactly were the supposed to be learned? What was marching bands supposed to teach me? And marching is not a particular we applicable skill in later life. And did all the other hand these things use in class taught me, but we need to be flat minor scale, the alternate fingering for D-sharp. Here's the sum of the... lessons, actually useful ones I accidentally learned well. I'm going to use an excellent lesson number one, Mark'sism for 10th graders. One so weak the best band is played with the orchestra. I played the bass drum in orchestra, which meant that I never got to play. My participation ratio was something  75 measures of rest for one big bass wallet, but gave me plenty of time for quite a few minutes. more fair of the situation. And here's what I figured out. Orchestra kids wore tuxedo. Bant is wore tuxedo t-shirts. The orchestra kids with their brown woolen and tonic last names had the well-scrubbed dark-plunk aura of a hit-breed. These were the sons and daughters of humanity's professors. They took German. They actually played soccer. Dumping the fluorescent t-shirts. the band's kids into the orchestra each week must have looked  tossing a handful of skittles into a bowl of Swiss chocolate. But nothing brings kids together  hate and the one thing and the one thing the band hits in the orchestra kid had his comment on the 18th of five gusts for the chorus. Who were to us merely drum a eat with access to four part cards? A shy violin player wasn't likely to haunt the halls between class playing Inaclan's house music. Anymore, the Nibankit would Blair land of 1,000 dances on his tube, but more than three inches out besides the man who's door. That didn't stop the choir girls from making everyone temporarily forget their locker combinations. Thanks to an impromptu, untault forpersed to frigidu. Exit on a Discovery number two, where's Walter? My junior high had an electronic music lab. We made tape loops and learned work  module box. In my spare time, , just for fun, I checked out all the books on electronic music from a library. My favorite records for a while there were Walter Carlos's concept album Switched On Bob, and it's sequel The Welled Inford since the Cybers. Have a Congratulations on your dear Jacob F didn't you call up again? But where Clarius Lee, Whitty, covers a box, classics for four of them get this, and moats his side. Then my reams on  how to use it for something puzzle-ish. Every time I look in the Walter Carlos, the information would just stop, and someone named Wendy Carlos would turn up. I got to school early one morning to ask my electronic music teacher what happened to Walter and was Wendy's Walter's wife for daughter, and my teacher kind of didn't answer for a time. Then he blurted up. Wendy is Walter. What did he mean? Walter had a sex change on pregnant and she made a mistake. That's a sex change operation. I know it's hard to have you now. Here, and Francisco. You managed to kill Hugo, and he never gave up that got stuck and swamps it Why did  that Mar From encapsulated each other's information when the unexpected updates understood each other were well- sommified in the form of a murder that we had Élu, thats part of this murder Recently, we believed each other in constancy even مع mum and her parents and dad would only figure out if she had discovered But as shocked as was, I knew absolutely nothing about sex. I'm gonna talk about sex. Why have sexed? Was it scheduled in the field of spring? I was a wholesome small pound Christian kid engaged in all-famous ball counters. Can't believe you've been selling. Damn, I'm standing at the corner of Sodom and Gamora and where's my street map? That Walter Carlos. I hadn't even recovered from the chocolate box getting messed up with her. Number 3, Biology, ASTEM. 7 grades I start a faint. I wanted to play the drugs. My parents lived with me as with the custom in my canis. It's not what made a play the drugs. So I picked the next loudest instrument, the trumpet. How I love my trumpet. Feel a bit in my hands. It's very volume and shine. I know what I especially love. It's been found. In eighth grade, a teacher told me about this good old trumpet player I might . So I went out and bought one of his records. And every night, for over a year, I went to sleep listening to it, saying songs over and over. Trying to figure out why Louis Armstrong's so funny, so moving, so good. And I got caught up in this super-star talent of his right around the time when it's played masterball. I didn't expect that I didn't have it. Hell, I mean. There was another problem too, which I discovered about three years into my trumpet career. I found out the reason I was getting a shot at tone and I had trouble hitting the high notes because of the shape of my jaw. She cute my jaw. I felt the world was more or less open. I was outraged that a person's fate could depend on something as arbitrary as angles of her teeth. I'm not... only that, I had to switch to a brass instrument with the bigger mouthpiece, the bear tone horn, bear tone horn,  trumpets are played by Miles Davis and bear tone are played by no birds. Less than number four, wind does cry. From the time I was 12 until I finished high school at 18, my four parents Calendar wish last ¨ and find ambitious roster of concerts and recitals averaging at least one-term. They were always so gushy in their support. Never dawned on me that they might have preferred to avoid Joe Jr. high school gymnasium performances of the theme for Miracke. They acted as though their world revolved around my sister and me, and that's what we believed. But I remember one night after an eighth grade the end concert, I caught a glimpse of pencil marks in my father's rolled up program. He told me that he checked each movement of each piece off as they ended. Obviously because he was counting the seconds until he could go home. At the time I took it badly. I was offended that he had so little regards to serious news about our interview. What did he do with drugs and cigarettes? Now I see those pathetic little check. marks his heart shake, some more than his love. Everyone says that love requires the utmost honesty, but that's not entirely true. Once I knew that my father was suffering from my state, really suffering, I learned that love, especially the parental kind, requires the heartwarming sacrifice that can only accompany faith in me. Again let him So, I was doomed at the trumpet, except it will have a baritone shaky on the Xilophone and few tritons of the Anno. There was one instrument for which I had an innate neck, an instrument I could play with some simbolts of grace. It was unfortunately an instrument which was already on its way out during the lifetime of J.S. Pock, the recorder. I taught myself to play it when I was 11 and by 14 I was perhaps the youngest member American Recorder Society, reading their journal, the American Recorder, and practicing the Elizabethan and Baroque music I special ordered with my babysitting money. I found out about an amateur ensemble that met once a week in my town playing mostly a Elizabethan standards  it was, a lover and his last, and a tempo marked on the metronome as post office slow. The members of the postman written. quarter ensemble as we were called concluded a retired high school music teacher to math professors and a number of housewives one of whom had a daughter in my grade. I was the only member under the age 40 and most of them would have been eligible for the senior citizen discount in the music store. I played with them for a couple of years till my pal Margaret and theoda and I broke off for my own trio. The three of us just claim  each other,  to play. That's school, and all those hours of actual classes with actual teachers music felt more  a job. Playing with Leonardo and Margaret was the first time. The only time I actually enjoyed playing music. Here's a little ways we can tell we used to do called Willow Willow. Which is actually my first public form since the Reagan administration. which I was kind of looking for to and on my way here it was  down mark a market and there was this guy on the street playing recorder and I kind of got a glimpse of what that looks . I'm a little less sure. So this is Willow Willow from me. Now imagine playing that on the street with your two friends who happen to be older than your parents and you look up for music. and notice one of your schoolmates staring on in horror. Andy hate for instance. We know what you don't care, you might even smile at. And this is the most important lesson of marching band of public displays of recorder to withstand embarrassment. I've even seen it out. To tighten herdingness to its most dizzying, willow willow, teacoteco extremes. and stand before my fears my head held high. To stick out my tongue at the end he heats up the world, run back to the baritone horn of life and blow my proud. fi 火 the Nio had his rejectow to what? In this act, we turned from four moments of course. What it is that music connection is the day now. It's  the class. Anlimada's the only writer in our show today, where lives in these samples is okay. There are many people in this book. There are a lot of playing returning home from St. Louis. There are a lot of playing returning home from St. Louis. playing on the runway of the airport in St. Louis, but I think they're not on these neglectspectation that we would be in the air suit as our flight had already been delayed two hours. I was anxious to get home, as I had not seen salmon several days, but all things considered, I thought I was coping quite well, especially because I am a skeptical and terrified flyer. In between the Vowering Hershey's chocolates, $13 for crash magazines. I had spent the time. two hours of the delay trying to be helpful for the other stranded pastels. I distributed all my magazines and most of my chocolates. I got an old man's water. I flirted with babies. I mingle, I shmoosed. I was Jeffrey Rush in Shine. I had seen what may have been a miracle at my church recently. We had been feeling ever since that I was supposed to walk through life the deeper faith, a deeper set. for sure instead if I took care of God's children for God, he would take care of me. I only hope was that nothing else go wrong. That once we were on board everything runs smoothly. My idea of everything running smoothly on an airplane is that once it is in the air, A, I not die in a slow motion, fiery crash or get stabbed to death by terrorists. That being and at the other passenger's quite a talk. We finally got to board. I was in row 38. Between a woman slightly older than I, with limited language skills. And a man my own age, who was reading a book by a famous right-wing Christian novelist about the apocalypse. A newspaper had asked me to review it when it first came out, because it's author and I are both Christians. Although as I pointed out my review, he's one of those right-wing Christians. who think that Jesus is coming back some time next Tuesday. Right after lunch, and I am one of those left-wing Christians who think that perhaps the author is just spiritualized in his hysteria. Also, I suggested in my review that he has tendency to be a little rigid. How is it I asked pointing jobily to his book partly to be friendly and partly decayed? were used to politically. This is one of the best books I've ever read, replied, you should read. I nodded. I remember saying in the review that it was hard core right wing, paranoid, anti-smitic, homophobic, misogynistic propaganda. Not to put too fine a point on it. He smiled and went back to reading. I couldn't begin to guess what country the woman was from. I think it's possible that she had one lot in parent and one Korean. She sounded a little  Latka, the Andy Kaufman, Kira-Gronk-Paxi. Except when things began to fall apart when she sounded just  the spaceman and Mars pack. App, app, app, she cried. But I'm getting ahead of myself. As we sat there on the runway, the man reading the book about the apocalypse commented up. on a small gold cross I wear on an X. Are you born again, he asked his impacts about runway. He was rather crammed tense, maybe a little  David Eisenhower with a spastic colon. I did not know how to answer for him. Yes, I said, fine, I am. My friends  to tell each other that I am not really a born again, Christian. They take me more or less. lines that old John Miller routine. What he said, I'm not really a Jew. I'm Jewish. They think I'm Christian. But I'm not. I'm just a bad Christian. A bad born again, Christian. And certainly,  the Apostle Peter, I am capable of denying it. A presenting myself is a sort of leftist look. the liberation, theology, and enthusiasm, and maybe sort of vaguely Jesus will be all. But it's not true. And I believe when you get on a plane to start lying, you are screwed into the very Lord. So I told the truth that I'm a believer, a convert. I'm probably about three months away slapping an aluminum. Jesus fish on the back of my car. Although I first want to see if the application or stick them in any way interpares from my leasing agreement. I just love the guy. I just love Jesus. It's that simple. Anyway, as a plain taxied out to the runway, the man on my right began telling me about how he is. his wife for home schooling their children. He described with enormous acrimony, the radical, free, brawfeminist arts, feeling philosophy of this counting school system. And I knew instantly that this description was an act of aggression against me. That he was telepathically on to me. Could see that I am the enemy, that I will be on the same curling team in heaven as Tom Hades and Vanessa Redgrave. But suddenly the plane break to a stop. We all looked around for a moment and then the captain came on the PA system and announced calmly that two passengers wanted to get off the plane right then and there. We were headed back to the gate. What we all cried? The good news was that this was only going to take a minute or so since the past two hours we only got about five feet. The bad news was that FAA regulations dictated that all of the stoked luggage had to be gone over by security to make sure these people are not accidentally left behind their pipe box. The lot being woman stared at me quizzically. I explained very slowly and very loudly what was going on. It gave that he for a moment. App! She whispered. Eventually, the three of us in row 38 began to read, and in our later-the-plane finally took off. We, the citizens of row 38 all ordered sodas. The lot being woman who's on a walk and began to listen with her eyes closed. The Christian man read, spoke about the fox. I read the New York. Then the seed belt flying in the pile of teeth back on. over the paces. I'm afraid we're about to get really heavy turbulence. So, please return here. A moment later, the plane began bouncing around so hard that we had pulled on to our Prince. AH! AH! AH! SAY THE LAPPLY IT! Growing for her sprite! Everyone take your seat. The pilot literally parked over the paces. We are in for some rough going by cart bells and railing jumpy playing rose and fell and shook And the pilot came back on and said, Stir, we'd  an angry dad. Flight attendants sit down now. And the plane hit those waves and currents of air on the choppy sea of sky, and we bounced and mowed and gasped. Whoa, we all said, is one. we were on a roller coaster ride. We're going down, I thought. I know what basic test. of the Christian faith, the sad death is really just major change in the dress. But I had to close my eyes to squinch back tears of terror and lost. Oh my god, I thought, oh my god, I'll never see Sam again. This will kill me a second time. The plain bucked and shook without stopping, and the Christian red calmly stoically, rather please let yourself seem to my tiny, spherical cell. The lot being closed for eyes turned up for walk. I could hear it playing song. And I, praying for another miracle thought about the one I could just... To place it  church, but one of our newer members, command name can, is dying of AIDS, Integrating for our very eyes. Came in a year ago, the Jewish woman who comes here from me, me with a, although she did not. Shortly after the man was AIDS started. coming. It's part of your guide of the disease. A few weeks later, he said that right then in there, the hole in his heart and his brand and stuff left, Jesus lived in there ever since. This man has a totally loved life in faith. Ravage may sit in and when he smiles, reads, he looks  God's craving and fill. He said that he would gladly pay any price. who already has now, which is Jesus and us. There's a woman in the choir named Rinala, a beautiful black woman who is smart, jovial, and sweet , and has an outest bee, but who has also been a little standoff, which was called Ski-Mikasa. She's always looked at her when she looked at him at all. His goofy rabbit, she looked at her side. She was raised by that, this Midwest, must talk to this way of life. The key was not... Bomination. Maybe it was part of the break. Maybe on the most visceral level, she was a little afraid of cat. I'm not sure. But anyway, Penny has captured almost every week the last year and one almost everyone else over. He missed a couple of Sunday's and while ago, as it was two weeks. And then a month ago we came back, weighing almost no a little bit more. His face seemed more lopsided and didn't take a stroke. But during the prayers of the people. He talked joyously of life and his decline, about safe and happy meals. So on this one particular Sunday, for the first year, he's so called morning, him. He's saying, Jacob's ladder, which goes every long goes fire, fire, the Kenny could snare. But by the same way, he's sitting down with the him, no one is left. And then when it came time for the second year, I think they were very tall and my waist fell out... and it turns out  I know. Or I'd stand there. I think I should be on the starting path. But I hope they are walking, they aren't too high, but they shall be the place with each other, and I would take it home and give those dreams on for you. whatever I do or do. sang his eye is on the sparrow. I noticed the can still could stand up the sing. The pianist was playing and the whole congregation had risen. And only can remain seated, holding the himnal in his lap. And we're no l who watched him rather skeptically for a moment. And then her face began to melt and can fort  is. And she went to his side and bent down to lift him up, lifted up this white rag doll. The scarecrow, she held a meds to her and he was draped over and against her  the child and they sang and it pierced me. I can't imagine anything else for music to could have brought about this album. How is it that you have a chord here and then another chord there and then your heart breaks open? I don't know the answer. Maybe it's that music is about as physical as it gets. Your sensual rhythm is your heartbeat. your essential sound of the breath, but walking temples are boys. And when you add the human heart to this mix, it somehow lets us meet on a bridge we could get to in another way. That combo, or little by little, the playing crew's steadier, and the pilot came back on to say that everything was okay. I was so excited that we were not going to crash and that I might actually get to see Sam again that I started feeling mingly. I suddenly wanted to be new best friends with a Christian man. But just when I opened my mouth, the pilot came back on the PA system and asked if there was a doctor on board. The woman behind us turned out to be an error, Scott up and went back to investigate. The Christian man prayed. I tried to rubber-neck, but I couldn't see a thing. I went back to thinking about can and my church, and how on that Sunday said A poomer Nola had been so skeptical, was trying to sing, but then he and Rinala both began to cry. Tears were pouring down their faces, and their noses were running  rivers, but as she held them up, she suddenly lay her black weeping face against his fever's white face, but hers right up against his, and let all those spooky fluids mingle with hers. He looked  a child in her arms, who was singing because tiny. children just sing all the time because they haven't made all this separation between speech and music. So he's saying and she held him up and she's saying he held her up. When the nurse sitting beside us, returned to row 39, it was with the news that a woman in the back was having a heart attack. I asked, but there were doctors on hand and the nurse thought the woman was going to be okay. Good fortune. We looked at each other inside. We shook our heads and continued to love each other. God, I said, I just hope this snakes don't get out of the cargo hole. The prim apocalyptic Christian man smiled. Then he laughed out loud. The lot being started laughing then all those who still had a walk man on. While I hate to look  I'm enjoying. my own jokes too much. I started laughing too. The three of us sat there in the starex and when we were done, a man reached over and pated the back of my hand, smiling gently. The lot be in woman leaded close to me into my Soviet air space. She be, I lean forward so that our forehead's touched for just a second. I I- I do I did not know if what happened at church was an honest to God little miracle, and I don't know if there has been another one here, the smallest possible sort, but now I felt  I was sitting with my cousins on a plane eight whales up, a plane that was gonna make it home, and it made me so happy that I suddenly thought, this is plenty of miracle for me to rest in now. Wow. Should I feel this curry? Why? To the shadows, crowning Why should my heart be lonely? And... long forever and forever. When Jesus, my bullshit, my country is here. Jesus, my bullshit, my bullshit, my country is here. And I know we want justice.
