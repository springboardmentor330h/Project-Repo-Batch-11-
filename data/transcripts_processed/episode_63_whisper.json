I suggested that there might be need for a group addressing concerns and co-lovers of the love. Anybody who knows somebody who might be interested in such a group should have their right to Leanne and I'm here this day. We all know what that means, it's time for this week's Leanne Challenge. Leanne is what she eats. How well do  what she eats? Everybody knows Lee Amlite's horsewatt is on her handbook. But what kind of horseman? I think here's a hint. She received a case in the past Christmas. The answer to last one challenge was, you guessed it, from left to right. I know a lot of people thought there was a pretty horseman in the horseman. Stop. Chloe has played a minute and just two thumbs up. Wait. Wait. Yay. Oh. , it's time for the mail. Oh, the mail ring. heavy to speak with entries to the candidate Lee Ann Photo Contesta. I think I need to remind everybody that the rules clearly state that Lee Ann must be the only person who's in case any of you want to resumine. I'm going to extend the deadline for two weeks to make me third. Please remember I'm going to just cannot be returned. Okay, first letter one of our far-flung correspondence models, right? I'm Lexington. I'm going to be in town in the near future and I'm hoping to find my lead. this line I've heard so much about. You have her phone number and address where I can write a directly. Well Miles is really no need for that. Why don't you just send your correspondence to the end of the long sentences? And we also have a letter here from Reggie, a Buffalo Grove, Illinois, who writes in. It's very interesting. I'm very curious about this. You write, Larry, isn't it time you've got on with your lie? It's been nearly two years since Leanne broke up with you. actually were a couple of certain things. And the way he says it's been actually two years since Lamborghini got confused and I hate to tell you how, but it's over. Oh, me, e, r. But listen, he says, there are a lot of other chicks in the sea, my friend, and they're yours for the picking, go for it. Well, ready? I don't know quite how to go sometimes. See, it's difficult to tell me exactly what is in the product. And for it, I don't share your perspective. Don't really get all the playground to have a reason. But please understand, honestly, just this. Hmm. But thanks for the letter, right? Your letter loves the antisure to the male. That's it for life without me, I'm sweet. And let's hope it's the last one. I'm Larry, and I love you. Who will ever, it's literally one more. Larry, do you? It's simple, which is it now, but he now loves Becky. Funny, it's not a star or a racy. It's always an action in a scapegoallogic. When you see it by one idea, I want to think. It's not  you choose it, it's  it chooses you. An often the one thing has a logic to it, it seems unstable. perfectly logical consistent systems which you can assign. The American AIX, Mormonism, the JAPS assassination theory is... This is a story of someone who found the logic of his one thing is his story. Power of that logic, to his logic form. He needs a story of what happened to himself. This is a true story. Set in 1976, Chicago Square at the Royal Library tells the story, for we begin a quick current to advise we if there is new to it. In the story. No, SAC, that's a great story. It's a great story. Eddie Hickah counts high school English, being Baldwin Long Army. remedial readers whose attention seems kept in far away from her memory and over. And then walking. Golden coffee, old and patrony-ri, they'll seem just right to me, despite the fact that catcher and the rye was under band bookshelf in the school library. The library didn't want to use the appware in which you want to do a one-to-one. for pitch to a one's and a one's is a little pinch. And he figured his renewal leaders would love to. His young who'd used to all wanted and needed to get naked and needed pitch to a one done. The school soon gave notice them. Under no circumstances was he the chief snack dervichertion man. Yeah, for beloved page to a one, they were deemed questionable in the couple. Haryf Nguyen V vibuhr. throughout the journey of their class and me. In the remedial results of no disdain art in the granted and all good ponds, one that long had listened to his over and the few that pleased him outdoors is good old home and coffee old beholden on me. In cheering and chanting out the effort in every tone he aged to one one. It would be cut down to his five in teaching his going and should not be lonely. Please grant the President momentary place in the final phase. That is more of a sense. It was a cold wind, but Eddie was already heated up from his recent battle with censorship, so Eddie pulled off more and more of his clothes and shirt which he was his piece. He clung them on the Russians. Eddie built up the fire and he sweated around. If he couldn't teach the upward, how could he live free? Matt, he demanded himself the upward and set sail. That had to make him lovely. That's a lie in white, so natural and warm-hard. down everything. And that's what we can stand. We will never be able to see anything. how an idea can't change, and grabs hold of it, maybe even. And I do it at Sweetstream's Pride and Magic, and the deepest hurtness, and secrets, and that I do this as here I know change everything, because I'm here. I'm open. I'm here. right in my situation and the new Latin cure for cancer I am my body in shape and perfect yoga pose and these ideas feel so cushioned with the access in the world turns to a ghostly that is a real thing these ideas making them bizarre and so it was without guilt or setting down no discussion Eddie Rand has been all new in prison. It was his first new run by his friends, the ship and his confidence, more on his own. Spinning in the business. And at the high school, all his former students, the remedial readers, their appointment, and appointment, lost him up. And Eddie happily known and called. He wanted to dunk a few in the wrongest sprint. Young good few and held smart guys in his new vision. And that is how these joins in the court, because for me we really want to see them. They turn you in. me, and then we see them. They refuse to pass in the wrong. And whenever we persisted, we believed that we truly was in turn. One important thing is to walk through the space of our life. So hard to focus on when we're in this hands. He was lost in the room where the river swung in home. Foot pops from sticks and clouds and dirt, and he was exposed to peeps in his poor mountain. And Eddie slammed the door of his mother's house, and his crying, and he was shaking. And all the room, the other room, the other room, the other room, the other room, the other room, the other room, the other room. and the one on the ground, the bread and the fruit through and his mother's picture in the room, the room, the shabby. And then there was such a roar, raved and heard, and just ripped to and his brain and grabbed the same brick, and really back to the same window, the remaining glasses flying, and then up jump to the now open window, fall and gashings, falling into the space. The remedial we did one of the directions, at a long, and long, climb us. And then looked at the sky, written in huge letters of flooding by and in. 6-2 times. 5. 2-3. 4. 4. 5. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 4. 5. 5. 6. 5. 4. 3. 5. 6. 5. 6. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. in the mind. In any way, they led them to decades of quiet years, years in which you memorize the ancient ones as you walk and come and come and come. It is by, is it within? In patient for the day when you come to come on and come to the spot for the public to. Any of that comes can you do to tell going on to work on the a way to go to a future where you make it solid, out camping wherever we need. The palace was our legitimate restaurant building coffee house. It was work and it was home for we know anyone get this. It was a workshop for our ideas and how to change the troubled world we've been given by our parents. It was also a refuge and a magnet for people who are obsessed with the one we were. Episode 7 If you thought it was amazing, now you've lost your children, you're doomed to wander the five women in the version of how I was looking for me. If you were hopeless this shine, allergic to the 20th century and everything you need to take, if you were a closet or a sinister, just needed, no one would blame this in sight. If you were a bottom-pinch of who drank too much snaps and read only 17th century literature, you were welcome to points. If it bring dogs? books, and the bare feet, as long as you didn't drink Coca-Cola in their hand, at least considered nothing more chances you were welcome. Only you never copies. Eddie said about side and pounds. Smiling silent first in the opposite zone of the 22, a second incident of those ennemies. the painless lungs, the child is magical. You have to be seen in the room. I did the research revolutions. And after editing a big emulsiveness, the difficulty of eating, the noise, and the grass in this basic message, it became not the sidewalk that it managed to talk to us. He would have helped speak, it could be speak there. In the eyes we went away. and the title of his first talk was, needed, into the mouth. He quoted verbally from the rationalness, his meaning, no. Or, in his name, always be, me who did it in the margins, and he was free, after the rationalness is, and the law and sees me, the ad, law and degrees and counts, and you didn't sexualize it, and for our man's square nod in perfection. Until the death. The Church of the Education of the Old Elch with Jim L. Sheath. That's bad. It's bad. We launch. He knows his pay. He told you to be now. We know after that we won. At the end of each performance we followed at the young man's son. The retarcin is closed in our direction before one month. Make it into the moon. The kelp is a small place, but by the next week when we spoke there was a real clown in the following mountain home for his first evening. Edward and Kikot come to blossom and live in the future. In about 4 weeks, the crowd urging him on the closed-minute mob on stage and he became the new public speak, sleeping out, but speaking new. He shouts. And Ed and Navigame's talks in the city. In the background he could be fond of the palace at all hours sometimes we polite me asking to dress for occasion right when someone's parents need to tell me then Eddie would put on his kill. I killed me out of the girl of conoptions slash crazy names. Once I'm armed in the business, I don't know what I'm expected but what she happens in naked in the last, Eddie reading me on time's book review and never knew what he would think of. for my mom loved me, your time spoken to me, and had me be a sense and because the off of it. The children were soon chatting about books saying that we have time to read and quickly they seemed comfortable to me and that was amazing for me. My mother had co-work for her and had not closed at all. It was only when anyone knew her. And asked something so private in my mom and never told me. when I was, am I my my flush and strong and strong and strong? And that's the thing, buddy, as much as you could do in your own and I  you. He would always find a way to push him just too far. As if any boundary or a border was a foreign, this to be disposed of, not in clear. And then how you felt, buddy? Very mood. into our house and write it some emails from you to say something. And some of them were happy to do it. Until the most private details in that interesting study showing these speeches surrounded by big wonderings and ancient things. Look at this! The police came to a hot scene when he was talks. He was arrested. And soon now, this new-and-sign it's an incline. Any thought that, Nessie Manak, in the womb, full of vision, the world where the pants come down in the sign of Tainy's synchronization, and the whole nation's freed from the shackles of clothing, walk freely and hang out in the east? And that is going to be inspired to a trial-alternate and phone calls to brush an ethnic grameinement in Jim Pardon's Cen. Edmid is called from Cornelondian, urging London's contemporaries to support his new strategy, international nudity and July 4. This arm now, the pants come off and simultaneously is synchronization for well-beasts. That's the arc. If you're naked, how can you take yourself serious? Holding a tank or finding when the nuclear warhead you'd have to sat down. Someone at the Kremlin actually answered one of Edmid's palms. And that he just poured an iron on the phone so platform but at the White House slidges pulling on all of them. Eddie Hartin noticed his campaign was in the net. Eddie's child friend, Disney, had his presidential campaign, stakes into the 1970s, and public international convention as a minute when it probably continues. This is American Life, my reclass. The Institute of the Programme of Course, which is a theme and bringing you a wide variety of stories to the kind. stories on that theme. Today's show, one thing, who arrived sassed with one thing.

He's one thing that we've been kind of, you've spoken in Newtoday, and just came up on crap in Disney's closure. Again, a parental advisory. There's Newtoday in the There was a large crowd in Disney's closure. New Judge Wapsson, Newtoday, will come out all these lines. and slipped on his kid's institution and he didn't. The judge found him in the country, and he caught stradden and caught him killed with him caught him. Eddie knew the commune, but the crowd was too good to rest, so Eddie shouted over and showed the poem and wave him past, urged him to join him for international nudity today. And he caught some move and wave him up and come to the conclusion. And he found this thing. Now Eddie was slammed for hosting. He's the one who caught him. He had sharp crickets with whom, and he didn't wish to hear. He knew it was money, but they not wish to hear the truth. There is an image of us, and it's time to give him a fine image for him. He's standing in his picture, and she's a good image to whom we are. He's a good image, and he's a good image.

And the old one was the sign. That's the perfect choice for Kansas City. I'm Lonnie. I'm Lonnie. And I'm recorded July 200 at the snap of the museum in the theme. It's a price mark in crossing the two rooms and room of tools. Eddie arrived right, running up in his fields into the shirt and cheating in the crossing of the room and cheating in the shirt. Someone pulled a baby from the crowd, ready to use some function. And Eddie spoke, he was pointing in his money to build it in the environment. And then in sign-to-use, synchronization. And then in sign-to-use, synchronization. I was then in this room. We all pull off our clothes. Really home of your own city. We were asking him in front of the crowd, and they could tell him. And in this room, we think that your own sleeping bar is on close to no directions with next visit. The police were from the police, and they were asking him, and they said, Why do you play the kid learning? And before they can reach a long, great,nov Combat. Just as a ... We've decided we have the most beautiful difficult vacation today, and we're librarian sessions and the only thing we can do in this life and to never have a Brewing system. and I'm going to be a little more remember. Eddie ran all the way to the sea. I'm also going to play by magazine for the story. I'm going to be a part of the problem. The pictures were all that we make in the human history. We're going to be a bunch of old farm owners and stuff for the sea. Kows down the seed of the big hog harbored in the rest of the apps around it by big, very vital homes. Make it itself.

And borrow the playboy magazine. precise and even he hid the horror room behind the panelies making me two punts steps in reaching soon. That was pretty smooth.

There were brieflets of child writing one name across Republican cases in the crown, but then they were replaced with this all-true, adult clowns, discuss, and sense. You can't just say, it hurts, hard men who have been put on curricular, knocking from the soapbox, and the slamming movements have suddenly dragged in bodily weight. At his anxious cry of looted now. ground out by police radians in charge of long shoot police boots. And Eddie said jail for the rest of the convention, his name would never appear on the republican list of nominees in the end, and likes of many presidential communities, just Jackson, and Colson, this was from the early days in the city, proved to be the most overwhelming backlash in the final . He returned home from the palace, but he was known quite soon. That his confidence dropped in the city, yet other people's, he could tend to be a little classroom before he could be called in the palace, and I was she along the side when he was calling his car. Each one of these episodes into general and more customers were a stream of nendiproms and track people's affairs in bad blood. It's strange when you think of me that you needed an example of this new attribution for your society. Mead. But that stuff is vision. It's one day in the view that I make a means of freedom and should be mine to be from. The last I heard of me, he could be back home tomorrow morning. Eddie began liberating maybe at some dogs and delicious dishes. and churping and singing. That's the thing about a messy manipulation. But one big idea, if you follow it to its logical conclusion, you don't know where you are in there. Adding that we're eating to it's adds and wants, good old page 211 that you remember.

Welcome to now in our program week. been hearing about eager, full-hearted one-fingers, and this part of the show we've turned to go left in, one-fingers, our first witness, journalists, for the boys. For the boys' rights for the New York Observer and other publications, and he has spent a lot of time with the proven conspiracy theorists. These are the people who see a sinister force who seek one thing behind these events. The death of Deputy White House Council Vince Foster in 1993, the rating of Foster's Office оказ efforts there, travel game. wet, pavol, muddy with his head-offs, and he can swap writing to prosecutors. Some also include on the list, drug and gun running through the mean airport and Arkansas during their previous years of governor, various murders and deaths, two numbers to this hearing. Spieson did his reporting for the boys became persuaded by some of the one things. Salve Raj, but he did not become a one-finger himself. Despite with this American life senior producer, Paltachal Boy says that before he first went out to meet the Clinton one fingers. His view of the list. fairly unindiguous. I thought they were really up to lunch. I thought they were not saying hung up in obsess. I had nothing really intelligent to say. So tell me a bit of what we first entered there, world, we are reading, we've some months that you really started doing these people. What do they ? What do they  as a well some of these people. need the Hollywood casting version of an unhappy obsessive. Some of them do. They're very unpleasant. They have weird idiot's synchroces. They're insistent. They're shrill. And you just think, this is one unhappy camper. And I want to get out of his personal space as quickly as possible. Having said that, I've met a number of people who were involved in the Clinton scandals. Who are- are very happy people who are engaging their talents fully. For most of the conspiracy groups, the main event of the Cooke and Puzzle in Cs is the death in Vince Foster. The official version of the facts of Foster's death includes the Anjali 20th 1903, Vince Foster drove himself to Fort Marshall Park from the suburban Virginia, Park's car, walked to a secluded spot in the Shonam City. As though request bail on evidence, they allow Sam Eunuch to introduce themselves as the Cooke, as The Cooke as the corruption eters is explicitly pre modified to any given place when they are over an incident. there's another version of the facts, it takes us  cattle on another duck. The most important event for me was reading the Sprunt Report, which is a classic of sort of call it conspiratorial literature, but it's a study by Hugh Sprunt of Texas, former Sprant for Texas outside Dallas, of the record in the foster case, and it's brilliant. And... When I read that, I realize that the questions that these people have raised about the events in Formosity Park are not trivial and not nuts. They are serious, good investigative questions. The most convincing evidence that fellow twice found in the Sprint Report had to do with the possibility that Prince Foster died somewhere other than Fort Marsha Park, and that his body was moved there by some. The report points out that there was no dirt on Foster's shoes despite the fact that he was supposed to walk this park. There were no car keys, families pocket despite the fact that he was supposed to be driven himself there. There's a missing briefcase, he was quoted witness, eyeglasses to a parking button. Can contemplate accounts on what kind of guns happening. and confidence . And at this point, I don't have any conclusions beyond the strong feeling that the Russian Anakin's important Marcie Park that his body was brought there, I feel. He may have shot himself somewhere else, I think he probably did shoot himself. The evidence is to my mind pretty strong, but they're seem to have been shenanigans. I want to walk and saw you time. And many reporters have gone to Arkansas and come back shocked. I came back shocked. I felt  the top of my head was blown off. I just felt that things were different down there that they explained who our president is politically in a way that was not apparent to people on these coasts who saw the Rhodes Scholar and the Yale Law School Gretchen. I thought for a little while that that would be as a journalist and a writer that would be my story. And I was in it for a little while. And now I'm not in it. And I don't fully understand why I'm not in it. And I was from months ago. I guess that I believe again while I buy their story. about this administration more than I find the mainstream story. There's a level of alienation in some of the stuff I've read just cruising the net that I just wasn't ready for and I just... I just feared what I might become. One one announces. and respectful company that one no longer accepts the official version of events with respect of Vince Foster's dad. People look at you funny. I remember one conversation with an editor and finally the editor said, look Vince Foster committed suicide in Fort Washington, okay? what can you say? When your wife is saying to you you're a nut or you've lost perspective, that's a, , maybe I'm making the wrong call but that scares me. And , I, that, that's rooming. It's just a question of how much you want to invest yourself in this position, I think. you pay a price, your skin is poor and that's the traditional price of heretic. I mean there's no, I'm not trying to be self-groundtizing, it's the ancient garden society makes with these people and I don't know if I want to make that investment. One of my first meetings with a person in this community, a guy I've actually become a little friendly with, and whom I have a great deal with respect for. And I'm going to call him Patrick because he uses an alias. This is a guy with a very Jimmy Stewart man, a very casual man, and he walked me through Fort Mossy Park with great patience, telling me his understanding of what happened to life on his night. in 1993 when Vince Foss was body was found. And Patrick's story is very logical one. He had hundreds and thousands of facts in his fingertips that I was in am a no position really to challenge. He's done more research on this than I have. And at the end of our trip through Fort Marcie Park, I said to him, , you give me a very logical story, Patrick, and up. I'm willing to believe what you're saying, , it's very logical, but I might just walk on. Wait a minute. What do you say? Well, he would say, , he would say, , accept it, and , , you just accept your own, and , you just realize that that's this, and most important thing, that's not offices. I kind of think. I'd say, yeah, yeah, I give in my understanding how the world works. I'm willing to accept that they have lied to me about this and that, , I got other things to do now. And I think he just kind of shook his head that that because that is to, that understanding is to set up his world view to go a little harder something. Philip White's novelist Kyle Mr. Miracle's ever. He spoke with the American Aquarius or Paul Top. Maybe he went get a striped shirt. Maybe he went get some plastic shoes. Maybe he went get some money, some glasses. Where the hell is this? At five, quitting. Back in 1994, Evan Harris quit everything in life. The job, the boyfriend from city. And she started the thing by quitting as abstract idea in and of itself. She started to develop a theory of that film. She went to many parts. And she started to publish a scene about putting the prime first, which sounds published a book about being called the web. The more even heresal to random words seem  everything in the world was made up of quits and quitting history, seem  a series of violent elaborate quits, minations and people's people's personal lives, enjoyed by a series of endings. Putting the kind of ends, the one thing which Evan Harris saw the bomb. The point of quitting history is... to move in the world and to and to get bigger and bigger as a as a her sincere I'm so excited I sometimes I just don't start to sound  I'm not this way about this I mean I  I just worry my talking about what am I talking about I do you understand this is so on my mind I mean I think about this all the time I think about this all the time I'm thinking about getting everyone out of this room right now , I really am. That tape is from when I interviewed Evan Harris back in 1990 for the spec when she made her be sets of places. She was the height of her quitting frenzy and thinking about quitting. At times she's trying to catalog still all the parts of putting you foria of quit the euphoria that we get it with. For now Evan Harris has quit quit. Three years after that, very quick her. She no longer is in the flow of one and she's done. I talked to her about it. It was really horrible. It was very, very horrible. And it actually happened in a very, very, very long way. I was taking this costume to trip. And I stopped traveling with the person who was helping me. Which was a very big deal. And I was sitting on a bus, and I was going to go to the bus. And I was going to go to the bus. and I could no longer think about which I can choose putting because it quit a short time and occurred and the person with whom I'm splitting was too important to funnel into the quitting stream because the quitting stream could be the idea that when you quit you will forget that's how I'm going to select one of the U-Depnitions of quitting. back there. There's that on one level, but then there's there's even more seriousness than what you just said. It was not possible to think through this as anything but what it was. That this was a relationship in person. Who I'm up? Right, and it wasn't just this theoretical quit. Right, there was nothing here I thought that I wasn't playing in the bus. In the air so then the fever broke. And the favorite part. When putting was all you thought about that, that when putting was all you thought about. You always said , nothing. Oh, it was great. It was great. My mind was jumping all the time. And everything that's fitting in and the art is in the puzzle. It's getting out of the puzzle, a big, jigsaw thing. And I would fit a piece and then and then start. But I knew this, I just picture you just just seeing that and just pouring these pages up and you just can't be right in a dream  you see? Yes, it was it was automatic right now. It was automatic, it was  some turn on faucet. See but what in your life today can you keep in that? Nothing of life, say again. No, no, you're saying nothing. I know, but I wanted to keep that in my business. But , you mess up in that past 10 to 14%. Yeah, I do, I really do, because there was no electricity. That is very exciting. And I think I have as much Martin Hissing. , I mean, I think I'm a little bit of a poker. I'm just going to say one more thing. And now you don't organize, you can come back to board that way. Now everything doesn't done one, everything's clean. Everything. Yes, everything's on. You didn't take me past something by, by now seeing everything in the world as every and not just going and everything done one thing. Yes. What? I am no longer doing the same thing. I was doing fine. And now... I mean, I mean, I mean everything and that one idea. Right. And I was able to navigate inside of me in terms of that one thing. So, I was a unified person and I actually had an identity. Can I ask you what else it would be asked by the idea? giving up that means we will be looking at that way makes us in my casaka for something by moving away from it but I didn't pick to move away from it it abandoned me I don't know it abandoned me really it's not it's stop it stops me so interesting no it stopped being bailed it's not that I decided to stop thinking about it It's that it decided to stop. Does it mean it stopped calling me? It was terrible. It was horrible. There was a time actually where I was wearing a wig. It was the one. Because it had a band and it wouldn't. It would. It was not meld. It was  it was  it was  it was  it was  it was  we had the The quit and I had been friends and then something happened. I didn't know what and I didn't understand terrible and quit. It didn't come to my birthday. For no reason. And yeah, wouldn't call me and wouldn't write to me and just disappear, vanish, and not for me to man. And so it's a use to see quitting as being the engine, the behind everything around us. Do you call that the best expulatory framework in which to understand the world? Yes. No, yes, yes and no. The sad things that I don't really have is in. I attempted, I attempted to embrace another framework. You did? Yes, it's a. Picking, picking, picking. Meaning what? Picking anything.
