I really sort of seen myself being a black man  that I mean I'm sort of into that idea I'm sort of into the idea of being the lawyer in ten. Trust recently he was up at a job with the country lawyer back home and so he ended up having to decide. What are they going to do? She grew up on a farm outside of Laundail, they were charged with sweethearts. And sighting where to go is the biggest question in the marriage. I tried to conceptualize myself because I really live in a community that could have lived in a town with two traffic lights. And I could not be it. I could not visualize it. And I think that only a couple of weeks ago, I told David that I could definitely never live in a town  Alabama. That's pretty strong, . In a sense, the dispute from stand to a difference of how they do a central factor of small term life. That feeling that comes,  everybody knows you, knows you business. He likes that feeling. People knowing your business are wanting to know your business. I mean it sounds  a horrible thing, but that kind of whatever knows this and some respects, keep you at keeps you in line. people knowing that my car was potentially parked at Lottis House at a time that it shouldn't have been. It keeps me in line. , I mean, so you don't do that. You don't do the things that  that neighbor next door can report back to your mom. , you just have to be  good boy. That's sort of the way that I see myself now. I'm out of the house. What a good boy. And I think that I was fucked against being a good girl. I mean, that's not a mischal, I didn't have any discipline problem. That's not a mischal. I think that at a very early age, I was dearly an individual, and I think that when you want to take a take-out, and be in your own way, and have a personality that may not be assimilated, everyone else is people in a small town because it's sick, out. Music and abortion and race relations didn't square with prevalent opinions in our speechy gave as high school, rather than fine. speech-critical of the school system, because a minor town stand-up people have apparently talked about it for months. It's a for now. There's stop living in that haven't. Trying to decide if they see small town right this cozy. There's cost a little bit. Welcome to WB Easy Chicago. It's a American life my request. If you do the program of course which is a theme, bring it with the right. of stories on that theme. Today's program, Small Towns, the claustrophobia and freedom and urinate for small towns. At one country-mouth city-mouths family moves from a tiny town to the city or it seems to them anyway,  a big city. At two, they get together of single farmers who are trying to get other farmers to stay in rural America by marrying them. At three, three-shikatsu. The good teenagers make the argument that the public housing project that they live in, a high-rise building here, and one of the biggest cities in the country, is actually a small town. Stay with us. At one city, Mount's country, Mount's. One of the classic American stories is the migration from small town to city, probably. Personal growth, dangers, freedom that happen to make them. Bye. contributing editor Sarah Valle went through that change yourself with her family, but with what's mock-hatch, the big city that her family moved to wasn't New York or Los Angeles, Boston. It was both in my town, population 3,000, which sounds  a small town, anybody who isn't a city, but wasn't fact 30 times larger than Brexit. Where they started. We were hopeful immigrants from small town Oklahoma who set out for a better life in small town. Montana and became new people. Where else but America can an Oprah eating, twang talking, Godfaring, good girl  me be given the opportunity to turn into the liquored up opinion-mongering he done I am today. My twin sister and I were born Okees in Muscogee because that's where the nearest hospital was, but we lived in Brax, a dusty little Muscogee County know where home to 1,000 people or 4 churches, one school, a couple of stores and a much village. by the bar called the Little Oklahoma. Our mother took us to Bragg's Pentecostal Church three times a week where I got saved, got baptized and prayed with her and the others in the ladies' prayer meeting for the Little Oklahoma to be shut down. And I sang, sang in church, sang at home, sang along with my transistor radio to the Tulsa Country Station. I sang for God because I knew God was listening. And I was sick, sang on a paper record. Christmas and here's the first song I sang into it. I hate that song more than any other. Every time it pops into my head I shiver because it's a spooky reminder of the DOSO woman I might have become had I stayed in that town, in that church where there are so many rules and so many eyes upon you. Not to mention the fact that God himself ran the biggest stake out of them all and you knew that come judgment day, you'd account for every last slip your preacher and his minions 500 somehow missed. Small towns are always hot beds of surveillance, but when you add fundamentalist religion to the mix, the things you can't do outnumber the things you can. Sex is bad, drinking is bad, smoking is bad, women standing up to their husbands is bad, questioning the scripture is bad, not attending churches bad, passing is pretty damn bad, and as my father would soon find out, moving away is really bad. If you ask him why we left brags and moved to Boseman, it's... believe me my mother's family has never stopped asking to launch into this whole song and dance about his help. One is a main deal was my asthma health problems. No, that you think giving us the old health line for years. Yeah, that was kind of one of the reasons for leaving here. Yeah, and what was the real week? The real reason I wanted out of there. Why? , also more is it with a lot? Cooler? Mm-hmm. Hmm. And any other reasons? , , that, I mean, what specifically? The hunting career career career. Dad, you're not answering the question. Tell me what you hated about Oklahoma. Mainly. Kind of the heat. My dad's being diplomatic. No matter how many times I reassured him that this radio program is not on in his stations in Oklahoma and that no one in our family would listen to it if it were, he still didn't want to come right out to say why he wanted to leave Oklahoma. It was to get away from family, his and my mothers. They were nosy and they were everywhere. Every summer itching to get away from their man-brags he'd drive us to the Rockies. Oh look at the pretty mountain's mom, say that old faithful. sure is something. My mother, my sister, and I just thought we were on vacation, Turns out Dad was scouting out in a scape root. He still wanted to live in a small town, it's just that he wanted to live in a small town where he didn't know anyone. So he picked Bozman. It was the right size, surrounded by gorgeous mountains, and best of all had the vitals statistics he was after. Val family four, acquaintances zero. Arriving in Boseman at the age of 11, I felt  we just moved to Paris. The town of culture and ideas of libraries and movie theaters and record stores. I still celebrate the first day we got there, doing fifth as a birthday of sorts. Boseman had miles and miles of cement for us to roller skate around on, instead of the birthday, 50 foot-stripsed wide in our brags back. My sister. and your Amy remembers pulling me down. I remember coming over the past and we've been now driving through the mountains or whatever. It seemed really perceived. It was weird being around so much concrete. We're gonna say, , you're just set loose out in the world too, where I know Oklahoma, we could wonder around that it was always in front past your or the backwoods and walk over to our pod. and they're just , because they're bound to hold the mountain. And it kind of breaks us out. And it was exciting too. What? , one of the things I  about living was that there was a library. , a room for it in Bragg's. There was that, , the whole school. There was one little, wasn't it, , a shelf. There was a shelf, but it's in books on it. And it was fun. And it was fun. people, and then Puzzman had separate buildings that were  very, right? And a fun thing was to go and look at all the bugs you wanted. In Phosman, I thrive, my sister blossomed, my father found his thrill, but the move is hard on my mom. She missed her ethic, fam. Things that make my father's squirm about small family, being surrounded by people who know he was exactly what she loved about it. Her family is huge and hilarious with big mouths and bigger hearts. And up north she missed her fiery southern-style church. There weren't any other Pentecostals in Boseman, so we ended up at the most frigid, watered down non-denominational Protestant house of worship possible. We were used to this wrathful egg. angry old testament creator and sitting through week after week of God is love. That pretty blanket. And after a few years our church visits tapered off, with his fine by me, mom on the other hand had to deal with not only her own loss of spiritual guidance and community, she had to sit by and watch her children's music. Let's talk about something we generally have quite a lot to eat though. Okay. Do you think, well as we know, that's something I'm basically lost my faith and never got a bet. Do you think if we had, I mean, is that a regret of your if you think we could stay, , Bahoma, I would still be right there by your side and your truth to you? Now, that means you can stay here, I'll look. because I do think about that a lot. I used to just really think, especially when I found out that , lost your faith, but we would have stayed in a home and wouldn't have happened to Sarah. , I feel really guilty, and really bad that we lose some on-hand and Sarah lost it. But over the years, as I've seen you grow up and realize  what your personal use are, I'm wondering even an alcohol. you would you have began to search in different areas and maybe down? Are you calling me a bad seat? No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not. I love you very much and I'm very proud for you You are and that's your choice, , but it don't eat from praying every night that you'll return your face there I need to tell me, I don't remember this. But I mean you said that once the year we were about 13 or so, that when we were in those minutes, that's down, and you asked us if we wanted to go back, for a while, and I would assume the reason for that is that if we wanted to say yes, because you obviously wanted you back, then we would have tainted up on dad or something. See you remember. that, yes, I really, really, I was it pray when we said we didn't want to go back. Oh, I was post-revellers to take this. , yeah, I remember that very well, , I think you were pretty quiet and it was really me what I needed to me. She said, mama, we understand that you're very unhappy here. and that you risk home. And if you feel that you need to go back, that's okay with Sarah and I. But we want to do. And I looked at you and I said, do you want to take your Sarah and you said, yes, I do. And so, , I mean, I immediately wanted to burst in tears that I thought I needed to pose myself here and waiter that night as I thought about it. I didn't think it was a real. turning point for me actually to start being having your involvement. Because I thought, okay, I can't leave my children, but I better get it to get. Because, and I know you really don't  to hear me say to Sarah, because you and Amy have been and are the most important thing in my life. And so there's no way I can just ever, on a way and rescue. There's so much mother. daughter, his creed in the way my mom says, I know you don't  hearing me say this. Because she knows I don't  hearing her say that I'm the most important thing in your life sometimes because of the guilt that involves. And before I started working on this story, I'd always felt badly about the way she sacrificed her happiness for mine. I grew up believing she would have been better off in her little Oklahoma hometown, surrounded my family in grace by the church. But I found out I was wrong. Yeah, still watched, still back to open home? Oh no. No, I actually can't hear the local home on here. Point out. , I really think that I've changed too much, Tara. I mean, I love my brother's back there, dearly, and my best friend, Kathy, and there's lots of, , wonderful people that I just adore and love so much back there. But I do. feel that I change so much in the 15 years that we lived here that I could not live , home  here. So now you think then that next to small? Yes I do. I'm going to be we're growing up there and being living your whole life there for you to find an interview that we're a Matthew that would be true for you. No. No. I-I growing up here I never even dreamed in- in my wildest dreams about losing the wife and me. I just always thought I just made someone here and get me right and risked my long teeth. Really? Yes. Thank you, Dr. He didn't seem true. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. That okay, we can. Oh yeah, yeah. It-. As difficult as it was, moving to Bowdoin the first through psychology, two years in all the changes. It really for all of them. What? , , a good food. Sir, if I was moved to the Exity Bronisman, so successful to decide to repeat the experience. Could we now focus on the test phone at our apologies for? see population 600,000,000,000 Cisco population 700,000 and then find it. It's an opportunity to act to how to keep him down farm. All across America people are moving away from small towns in rural areas in cities. So if you have stayed in a place where there aren't many people and the ones that are there that you've known since birth, how do you find somebody to that the most important thing is today.

And another state about a group, Mary, I can't, I just can't believe. That's a hard thing. Yes, yes, bragging. I couldn't see why if I met that much viewer, I should get moved there, I'm not used to it. Yes, it's her land event for a family for a long time. And it's, I guess, this is a typical crowd for people in SIA. They're all from all titular moments, or gym situations, particularly in cars. Tows can realize that a few years ago, when groups direct one out to visit, even she was stuck by how isolated she was. She's... said it will take you apart for one to two to three. You feel as if you were doing it. I would  to, I guess it's always in the back of your mind, you were able to, but you want an honest answer. I don't think it's gonna happen because it's gonna take special off. You're a city, you're both you are. I'd ask you would, would you be willing to live out, even give the race you look at. It's a time that we walk along. Jim's own mother, who admit that had she nervous she could move in. She might not have married his father. It's Thursday night, the person I did get together, and we're all at a dance in the tree's museum with voice or soul, really helped us to dance. Everyone's so happy to have the sense I'm talking to. I'm not a Tudditheese. About 10 I sit down next to Mark. Twice widowed woman from the end. She's small, nearly six, wearing sweatshirt she's decorated with glitter feet. SIA's books and blood. I guess they said they didn't live for. I'm very lonely and I need this. You think I want to? I'm just left the first camp out I went to. I cry, but it will. and they were saying I'm church music and I couldn't sing I was crying so hard and it would give it everybody hugs and I love hugs and this one guy just held me and how many of you said are you okay he just held me and held me till I got kind of calm down  I said just show how lonely I am I guess. Are the tells me that the favorite dance is the waterfall? How it works is that the women's going to go on. The men born and other, Mitch and me and middle will visit, couple stands up to lower. Martha tells me she likes the water bottle because you don't need a part. You just stand in the water bottle, and pull about to close that hot. The next day is Friday. Apple farmers port yellow прошipse face it. The other half tracked a Houston for a world fair style live scholarship. About every 15 minutes over the course of the day, some they tried to convince me no scoop isn't about. But friendship, broader, everyone's one big fan. But later in the afternoon, I bumped into a group of SIA when we were clearly on the day. Once just bought a t-shirt that reads cowboy but strived me down. Yeah, I'm certainly a world shirt. Civil laughs. When we were eating. They walked past us. No, no, that's one was the guy that was showing the palenina horse. He was good. He was , you got a black hair right here. So what do you look  for him? He's Levi's Wranglers. What's in them? These girls are a rowdy, hardcore bunch. They're youngest, around 30. Loud, constant, and fast. Kate must vocal men, broad, strong, a dairy cow brand with them as cons. In this crowd. she plays the top of it. She brags about time for that. She dances with it if someone wants to write the show to me. But once alone in her hotel, she will tell her act. I think Miss Altnis Laney, she'd be  a lady in the mean I treat them. Then well, but I guess I'm kind of  more traditional, we better listen to this song. She goes on to talk about a friend of hers, a woman who prayed every night to me. So that she did. But you do that, you pray. about what the kind of person. Well, yeah, I mean for that you pray that God will lead you a guide you to earth, guides him, you to meet sometimes, , and what kind of guide you would make, , and she told me, these specific. You can't do seeing all the guides, two legs of head and whatever, but, , sorry, you're following her directions, are you being honest? I mean I do this  every night, . Oh, there's smoke. There he does. Down the hall from P or Ernie and Sally, a couple who met through SIA. He's 50 years from Oklahoma, goes sessing in the river's mail. She's a school teacher for Kansas, incredibly high, and a short take dress, baby dotty. At this point in their relationship, they only book one to talk. And right now, Ernie is in there. It sounds. smell of a potsy is mine now they detailed their first date. We're going through a dance. I'll wait for you. And I got through a house and I was six hours to get there. Six hours to get there. On the last 15 minutes she was by giving me her type of dresser. Okay let me explain. Turning her brought over a blue flag of gods is form of white paint. Sally one. I'm gonna be wearing this costume. I get there and she's, oh, I got to try that dress on. She looked at it. She ran in the bathroom with this dress on. I know I didn't know I didn't pretty soon have her this. Her knee. I put this in the dress. Help me. And it's tight. She looked tight. So we kind of stand there and talk a while. And it looks  they want to do. And I was wondering where do you grab? What? Where do you want to get a hold of? Both our knees. Sally Mossler's spouse. They both felt sparks, viruses, months ago, papers, men. They live a reasonable distance apart by essays, and it's bad. And this is the problem of national organization for all signals. We're just explaining here in the hospital to team. Four hundred four miles. My door to you is... ...get full of your renovated teeth. Good six hour drive, and I'm care how you go. Oh, Bill. She's , she's a very married woman. And she said, I'm just a little bit. Can you believe that? I can't believe that. She said, I'm just a little bit. Oh, wow. Sorry, I'm already on this little thing. most sentences. So, I'm half in the chat. She read some parts of the book. And then we've had two. They love each other. They're into points in their lives. She's the whole universe. The evidence has been died at heart of death. There's that weird, right? What about body or your before or after your child? Yeah. The evidence. He didn't expect to meet somebody. So put that. to us, sure he'd meet somebody at all. Mary John didn't have many girlfriends before that. Right now, this is first round date. It's a headache experience. And why he's not ready to love me? When, when, if you're with a, you're in, it's definitely a plus a word someone needs to love. And I'm not even a major thing I finally do, but again everything is out right now. Friday night is the second and when I bump into Ernie he's passing out these business friends. They have rainbows on and they read Ernest earned W Schmidt, very 32 years widow, I'm attracted to let's be good friends. Sally as in my mad, it's not so throat-fabulous. She has enough evidence at least for the time being, while Ernie Mongols who talked to her in that room. Oh, I would marry. Yeah. I mean, I... We've great enough of her. That's right. It's good for you. Because I have spent nine or eleven years. And I haven't met anyone that I've learned from her. Sally stops her interviews and she better get back to her. She's worried about the mischief. The moment later we head out from the bathroom, I'll see her need the plunge with two stepping on the dance. We'll see you in the next video. Half an hour later, we left Ernie's house. He's not a brand-new. Sometime after this, Sally sends me no. On the envelope she writes, in all the capital, I will earn you something. And I'll be in the middle of the house. The night starts wind down. At least I think it starts wind down until I realize. Nobody's planning on going to sleep. Take a free bus. come to SIA spend a lot of time alone. They pay for affection, peace, honor. It's past midnight when the farmers leave the busie boat and turn to the beach and tell everybody's tired but we don't go to bed. I got a showy so far. Just remember that song, girl. Jim, first guy I talked to back for a dance, drags a boy, float, float, float. Why are you riding? I love you too! There's some of the weird little spots when I say I'm sorry. But right now it's out. The air is so difficult. It's up. Well, I think I'll do the passion on the boat. There are. Turns to go away. Yes. Yes. You're very calm. I'm so glad I got you. Make me sing! That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Leaving Weinstein, couples this, I head toward the Kleinectic night of the weekend. Mmm. That's a good thing. Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to E 특 league Happy Birthday in Illinois. Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday! This American Life is my class, each week which is theme course by the variety of writers, Port is, that's this is. Take a whack at that theme, three-sand swathlete. Let's watch stories and continues about a poor day get together or mess I did. Saturday we wake up to some incredibly tedious meetings, which by some heroic fake people managed to love. Completely undermines all critical standards of what's compelled, what's fun. Even financial burden, people are able to inspire a lot of different ideas of the last day of the activity. Later Saturday afternoon I catch up with Part-Mil, the woman who told me that SIA was who was to live. She's in her room, sewing the final beads on the sweater.
