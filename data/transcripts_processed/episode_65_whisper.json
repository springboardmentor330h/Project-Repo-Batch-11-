  "text": "From P.I. Public Radio International. From P.I. Public Radio Public Radio Radio Radio International. The B.B. is published this month. Life was last. And I probably didn't really began at the dinner purposes. But a month ago, three numbers of this month, my staff, leasing and all, reading, rolling all in the tunnels. I don't know how it came up. I don't know which one of us... I don't know how to start. I don't know how it just came up. I remember how he done on the tapping things. But we started. Imagine. Can I do this? And I guess I don't do Muslim as the human being. He started with William Shatner and I thought that was wrong. What did he say? That he was cleaning. I'm not a Muslim for a time. I'm a Muslim. That's always said about it. He is the needy. And what's the problem with that? Well, the problem is that I grew up watching, , start cracked. And he's just  my American idea. I mean, he represented for me everything that's good about America. At least for a second. , before you've shatter, just can edit. I might as well be there. This is just a dark medium as among us. It's that they're at the very epicenter of our culture. It's the guy who created Saturn in it, live, and engine theory, and Michael J. Fox. It's Mike Myers, and Ron from Baywatch, and Bayonderson Lee. And the director of the Terminator film, Screams Cameron, is Matthew Perry and Jason Priestley, a line of Samara set, and Celine Dion, and the basses and Courtney Lovesman. I remember at least being... He continued and repeated amazed as she stopped eating. And she, and it wasn't just that, , she'd be shocked at one and with then to go on, I mean, she'd come back to one that we're shocked in earlier. Oh, I can't hear him. I can't believe it. I'm a woman. Peter Jennings especially. But he's just a newsreed. But he's just a little bit. information about America to America. He's  the leader who buys this together. Yeah, he interprets our culture class. So, it's  having, , some  Chuck the Syvacium is  a group-based president. I mean, it's just  wrong. There's something that that's wrong. She just doesn't just wrong, not that big actually, she being an entrepreneur. For there to be a Canadian broadcast in the news? Well, I'm crying that button. I'm happy to see an entrepreneur. Martin Be Yes Manada is crashing the hyped cash monster. But I see an end of the night,  what I'm saying. Well I think that Mackins generally think of ladies as pretty quiet, non-script, stay on kind of culture. And when you can, ladies can mean that in states, and have a kind of impact on culture, I think it's a surprise and fact, but I also think that it's over the starband, it's booting that, it's McCutt. They haven't known, , it's  some of you, , discovering everything believed about someone who was false. I guess it's the whole invasion of the body's natures in them. , they look  us, but they're not us. It's really  people hearing that somebody they didn't know was gay is gay, and it turned them back on themselves that they could have brushed so close and not know. He's Canadian, so that's why he never married. Exactly. The thing about the Canadians' mongers is, it's not true what it means. I think that's part of what is so... How about this? It doesn't suggest anything. , it's not, it's not that, , always Russian. It must become anist. Oh, he's French. It must be rude. Oh, they're just... It's just a sense of the there a little off somehow it's in way don't. Don't understand when you can't put it down in that that makes it all the more and settler can't put it anywhere just having rest there. So it's just too easy. Stir it. What's it in a program you try? makes sense out for the names, having this million menace among us. If it isn't menace, all the sour stories I am about millions of its, heck one, white, black me, one Canadians attempted passing in New York City, back to the world's most perfect magnetic vacuum, much around Sarah Valle arm wrestlers with the Indian Brown of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for what it means to be American and excuse, круп Asian, and if they are ntrad all. Act 3, Looting, and expose only pro-cmediate and bias in Peter Jennings Nightly Newscast Raid to see more at 4. Who's Canadian? Two siblings separated, not at birth. One gone with mint egg. One gone and then happened. There's story, stay with us. This set was just right Act 1. What type of name? When he was 17 year old David Rackoff moved from Toronto on to Rio de New York City, he's been there now for half a slide, works publishing, and as a writer and actor. His mountain life listeners may remember to story about the trans, segment for it, and Christmas members at Barney's. It's good. David Rackoff says that from the day that he arrived in New York City, he decided he was going to try to face his neediness. It passed well. My tactics were to ... a doctor certain kind of world-bearing, shaded, anxious and eroticism. And it was taken on as a cosmetic mantle. And it was taken on as a cosmetic mantle. And it was taken on as a cosmetic mantle. And it was taken on as a cosmetic mantle. But there you are, years later, a jaded, affectless, eroticism check in the sad person. But , that's fine. And would you consciously erotic, that you? No, no, I would never concentrate on that. I would have to concentrate on bringing them. Amazing. I'm just going to be a little bit of a sparse. I think that's why I'm not here in the world. I'm just going to have a nice little piece of the world. So, , occasionally I'll need that a little bit of sparse. Or what's more spicy than being Canadian? I asked, how the Canadians tend to know who else is Canadian? Spades. Oh, every. And that, to be in the hands of the , they're the easy ones when they know. They grow, how would you learn from them? Mindy, ha, wait, Mindy, ha, Now's the bloods made to deal. Who could be more American than the bloods made to deal? Even the name is made to deal. And I guess that name, Monte. There you go. Who else? Bra. Go ahead. Jock. Go ahead. Let's go. thing about knowing who's kney? I mean there is a woman named Shania Twain. She is kney. I know the cheese cream. I do not know who the hell Shania twidd is. I don't know what she does. And yet for some reason I know the cheese cream is in a room. And the cheese cream added this come up with your parents talking about it. I need to know the name. She's fine. Because I simply haven't known her. Here's your view. Boy is something. I'm not coming. Not coming for yourself. Not coming. Galci, look. Yes? I'm not coming. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. In my life. How do these things end to my life? But it's up to somebody. Hold. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. Hold first. I know. I'm not coming. Who's playing? I'm not coming. You're coming. And of course, no. The armor, I'm sorry, the armor on your space. Or make Eastern stone repair. In Canada the space shuttle is through to us, the American space shuttle is. Never any other way. The American space shuttle is in time. No, that didn't really happen. No, I was actually here. It's not down here. In fact, if you were to ask most Canadians, what do you think is special for this? You don't go to a drop and move stuff around. Wait a moment. Hmm. Hmm. And so when a Canadian fight set with some food, it's worth a chance. Oh. So this is an economic transition with a Canadian adult. If , if you do, but we're talking about, , we're talking about, we're talking about, we're talking about, we're talking about, we're talking about what was in your purse. And I would, I would be known. I would actually say, you would actually say it's some point , he's been... I wouldn't even not even at some point. Let's try. All right. So anyway, I was in the car and I went with work. And this is the song, fucking turner of the second one. That's how I don't even wait. I don't even wait. I don't even wait. And then I'll tell you taking care of business there. I don't even know. Sorry. And you're all... is also begs the question. Oh, pardon me. Really people who had been asked that? Well of course not. One balance. One balance. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. That's a big rub. That's a big rub. Two. Two. Two. Spring, the It's very good every. Every of his is well within one, ever very soon. Now, who is it? who is the game of clickволs? Who does it do? Oh. Yeah, heart somewhat, until you refer to that. In the imaginary pieces. Lawrence, grease. You fairly gen, spend what more. Do you remember this coming up? Do you remember this coming up in your household? Absolutely. Please, lady. Please, do you? Who's a girl? Oh, , and imagine how classical and everybody was really talented and very marketing science. Yeah, it's not just not Jewish, but she's from Maine. She just lived together. And everybody shrugs and says, well, our minions, , they're very similar. It's a crab box, but she looked so hot. When you need a candle, do you have a suit? Petsu's pants, what's it? What is it? Yes, I worry. Back. ,  this. as a community, as a country. How did ? The Davidson. You're not a sophisticated New Yorker. You're just nothing but a bargaining lady. That might be a real crime. Good excuse. all the whips that I named all of them. So if  the design that I've made in the future, you can add in some of my little slasms that I used to work. That, yes, you do. Hmm, pretty. And then another thing. What's the meaning of... What is it? sounds nauseous and oh And in fact it's a little bit even more windy. Not bad for a boy. Look around your eyes  this a little while on Manhattan. We could wrap up immigrant. in that stage. When you first came to this country, there must have been differences to quote the structure. Well, there was a door on the ground. And I'm going on the gap from Talians in one night. There's a reason to quote. And we'll be going to the dairy case and seeing that what you call those individually rap slices of processed cheese food, that cheese, yes, that we. And I am going to stop from this matter. And now, of course, my feeling is that we should be calling an American Jesus. You guys should be calling it to maybe a Jesus. I mean, it seems  something that one should be throwing a blame right across the 49ers. Whatever side you're on,  not on that. So, sweet. So, we can't enter that country, man. Jesus, that is that is hot. Canadian singles sounds  the name of some bad and quite cool. So, zip jumps? the Canadian Cameron Crow right, Canadian singles. You're living in a weird cable here. No. They all work in your car. They have some fun working. , some of them are majoring in animal hunt. David Rackoff discusses things, Nadian and things American, his new book, and it's a lot. Back to the world's most perfect pneumatic vacuum. Nadians, they got our TV shows, each same breakfast. The reals drive the same cars they look  us they speak the same language. Anyway, so, are they us? With the perfect person to discuss that question with Ian Brown, for years he was the host of Canadian Broadcasts in Corporations for the Sunday Morning. Ian Brown is the perfect person to discuss the differences between Canadian and American culture, not only because he feels his Canadian is so deep with, but because he lived in the United States three years. The American is the American is the American, the American and Paris. He spoke with the FBI to being editor of Sarah Bowle, but still hostings. most Americans, I don't particularly care about Canada, but every week I spent three solid hours thinking about going on in Moose John and Mansoba. The reason is this. Even though I don't care about Canada, I do care about Radie, Ashinch, and my favorite radio program. Side for this one is Sunday morning, and the most moving segment of the show is New Hall. host eating grounds personal essay at the end. One week it's about hockey vs basketball, the next about his opposition to a separate clubette. But what it's really about is the idea of nation. Listen to him as questions of his country and his place in it. I get to ask those questions, but it's not something we tend to dwell on in American broadcasting. But Brown says that in Canada it happens all the time. And because American cultural presence is so huge and so. to make himself a reflection must buy definition involved thinking about living next door to such an noisy nave. I think, , we've developed the same attitudes that say the fact that he's had who was in view. There were all the same worded polls have to rush a American culture. Seas is you, but at the same time we're not part of the American culture for years, he's a popular source. Many. So it's not as being we're Canadian, it was not a merit. It's not a very good definition that it's certainly one that a lot of people. So when you're here without the protection of the border? Well, exactly. It's a swallow. It's ripped around. You do, you're always slightly afraid, slightly amazed, slightly aware that you're swirling some huge vortex that might just suck you down. same time. I should say, I'm not idle to witness why we share with one of the reasons why the source of system is such an energy. So, for the world, it is the great empire. So, let's put it in the 3D. Pulling in the fourth 20th century, I was thinking about this, and I was thinking about this. I was thinking about this, but over the weekend and how I was in very soon. gradual your app to independent scene to me. I was wondering how in the world if each school children about this really kind of complicated subtle history in a way that we have way inspired. What struck on quite an important character? It often is, it's fun because it is so gradual when we've been talking about some human studies to my...to react. I've fallen since I was about to flag the thing,  I was. He's an American flag. No, it's native flag. Wait, when we finally got a flag fall. And then what year was that? Well that was  65. Really late. Oh yeah, exactly. 100 years after you did that pitch. Which was also first , which is also fairly good. Yeah sure. So we're graduates, we don't  to be extreme, market average says this team is so cold, careful, we'd  to take the most off the road, it's cold, we'll keep these summer clothes on, even though pretend they Well, I mean, I was thinking about this the other day and I asked them, I was I don't know, engaged in it, he's engaged in a little, that's the first thing and they can be a friend and I was talking about a friend who can be a friend and then to the Constitution where it's in grace it's  we the people and life liberty for suit of happiness and how do you think that that's in enormous bearing of me certainly as a writer and being the same  they can that it's codified within these governmental structures. And I went to the United States, what's your sound fight? He said he didn't have one, he doesn't have it. Is there a sound fight of Canadian this well I was  true or strong Please sell That's always that's always a Important so that's always the one I  the whole cares Few acres snow He said that I was  that in tweak I feel  I had snow just make you went go out to change the world No,  what it does is it reminds you of this country for more people. This when you, you folks have all these ideas. So, for example, this is a pseudo-fab, it's  good news. But there are ideas, and this country does have really exist. I mean, when I was always in business departments, I mean, the voting starts. This one idea is to be a man and see the democracy. Wait, is that a man is sitting together in the digital systems. But after a while, there are so many digital systems. They're there. In some ways, Canada has exactly the arms of the weird, we need it to be a man. And for so long, impossible. And individuals, and still be a Canadian, and as to do with the how-of-you-for-patreists, I always know that I've been a good man. the world is quite a little bit different. I'm gonna say, how is that supposed to happen? Can I go? I don't know, 100 miles north of it? There are places where you go out and push, go out and push, go out and push, and you really do have this sense that you may very well you first person. , this is really virgin, you're a step. And that's an incredible, that's the thing. And I'm from my team now. But you don't have the same way. I'm not being meant in modern. , I've been on the top of the 20-year-old TV, around the snow. And you get up there and what you do is sensation you have. There are things. This is, this is in front of me. It's my understanding. We're so many people on the floor. Lewis and Clark, we're here. We're above all all these people. And I'm standing in there and puts the steps, the great thing. Where's the candle? The exact opposite. No one's here. I'm the first person. And 8.5 March. as it has been consequences in America. , the great history, the traditional art, these things, seems to be the fear of art. This can, it's so hard to think, well, I can do something new. You can break out of the box, so it looks  this. And in one, nobody thinks you can ever fix the slide hand. Try it. Whereas, can, they exactly do opposite power. We all think, well, I couldn't possibly do this, because no one's ever been here. You don't understand what? , it really is the idea. And well, you're right except the very idea of America is that even though tons of people have been there. The idea of America is that , he doesn't keep going. Yeah, but you've got to be so warm on a 100th year since last year. With a fact to share the spring. Is it a thing to really net? Well, I'm sorry, but , I mean, how does he fit in the mattress? Should I make it for you? That's the end result. Well, I mean, we have to take the egg and we will have to act to see here. Well, that's what makes your country so interesting. That's what people stare at their parents. Or there is no individuals. Follow. We think all these dogs. Yeah. A lot of interesting words that many cats were. Well, I have a map. That's right. Now, I'm sure we will hold that in the game. No, but my name is Holcomb. It's true. She is. She says, , there is a distinct animal. And she's a love. But he says, people are always saying, , that's so apparent when someone comes and says, for someone who needs to be a good man, and he should be good. In your face. Oh, then, so I've got many remembers. It's good. It's hard. God, you, you're a different. She thinks it's quite wise because I will say it's a different. I never noticed anything  that. It's very, very, very far. Place it until you stand. It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing. You want to do it too? Who records one of those particular moments? Where? You felt  an alien or you felt  a American did or something. You see it completely foreign to you. That's what works. Very tough. Just... That's right. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Not a loud, but I'm looking at our debate. That's what I'm talking about. was, when he had parents... speaking in them father, had the same positions. And I said, as we want, some god, logo, eh, when did kis did turn their campaign back. Then, Slide nose  this... Go philosopher what? Sure-yeah. I mean games, drinks, sleep bar broken. Maybe he'd shoot me. Maybe he'd shoot or not, maybe he'd shoot me. Okay. D Ooh! Eat my arms, but get a glass of sleep. Tudor? Tudor! Tudor. Eat your arms, leaves a locker book. I should take your limbs. Eat my arm,cenning you. Tudor! . No Canadian fireman. Yeah. Would ever date? We come close to tell you. Especially, come close to the phone. Well, it seems  the things that you've been bringing up these differences are rather confined to the spirit of minutiae. I mean, are the two cultures really separate? Can you separate them? I think , I understand your question. There are so. many similarities that many Canadians ask for much the same. The world's harmony, we're all the same, as jerks. But, similarly, we're very different. We have part of that, T-Demons. , there are at least two and possibly more parts of everything's voted on. You're, we have a left-out representatives. Intervenir bodies come South. Prime Minister is chosen to move outside. And of generalism. That's not the case in a vermin. You have this hop that it checks balances. And which seems to us to have no direct representation at all. And judging from the equation, there may be fractions, which you vote, a lot of Americans. Two, where's the candidate? What a pretty hot. But besides these political differences, I mean, how,  for instance, it seems  we have these content we've been having this time. conversation around here in nowhere. Someone says, ah, Neil, Neil, Neil, everyone's his Canadian, , or Mike Myers, or Pamela Anderson Lee, , the blonde, then both aive of all kinds. The game is just a Canadian. Yeah, I mean, it always is the same way. And I mean, it seems  a... Despite the small little differences, even he'd political what's it's really hard to tell American Indian. But it depends on your measure. I mean Neil Armstrong is great at Neil Armstrong He was an American right? So first time I'm a funny American No, it is he is he's a brilliant song right? This is so he hits the universal You but he's very  eating people my favorite song keep on rocking in the free world Which is to me maybe one of the most American songs it has this incredible beat It rocks it's about its condemnation specific of the Bush administration, but it's also that hope and imagination as well as direct foam in the ozone layer. I mean, it's a tool. It's an American sun. Well, I, , that's, I think you defining the song. It's one deal defining the song. One of the my favorite songs is, because there is an in-or-fontimian. I say that's the, it's the, the, the, the young song. To me, he's, he's huge. Tomato Finger and a, not always ID review. usually can any busy rights. Soongty does so many of them have ordered or nicely built to them because they are about strong emotion expressed, why and lose? Express, quite, best. But also because these the atmosphere is supposed to be well-gained, everybody ready to go. So I can't separate it out. We can't separate it out. We can't. We can't separate it out. Well, as I say, we're talking about the universal. what I'm saying? So everything, it's something to everybody. make sure it has a large bustling. So she feels... They say that? Marker sometimes there. She... What is she? She's  the most universally new man in the world. Maybe. Well, so that's true. That doesn't feel particularly good. Particularly good. Okay. And I understand why, but she's not a serious person. She's a woman. Baby! I only want the series people. I only want to claim me a young. I only want to talk about the ones that you can actually measure on a real, unreal face. I don't know what family it was before. She was inflated. But I'd be willing to say the old, uninflated family before she became almost quintessential polyurethamption. I bet you could find your name instead. I don't know. I don't know. We would be an interesting story. And is the plastic surgery? Is it that part of her is now physically American? That is deaf. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. No pal, that part of pal, no less of Americans. I know that you're running out of time. Not your time on your internet. So I'm asking for the end. What was your favorite thing about being a human being that's human? Americans? Americans? Because, . So I work as a writer and Canada, you're always one of the biggest parts of the jobs to draw for a big help. You can't talk, get real, it's just a conversation, be yourself. Americans are much less conscious, so much less self conscious. They're much more themselves in the world, and they don't write, they're  America, rich. You get all this incredible unconscious behavior happening right, front of you. It's  having your own little stage. Where every ago there's always some entertains because there's always people being themselves You don't get that as much in Canada. I found it. We am used to you. No, I don't mean I don't mean in the condescending. I'm glad I'm not up. , but I love having a scene. And the feeling of being soft and moderation is forgot about letting children sober either one day. And the moment I got that, I had to draw things down. Coming up secret pro-conedian which is in Peter Jennings' nightly newscast and more in a minute. This American life, my reglass, if we can put into this which is seen in the Appropriate, in terms of storage and networking. Today's show, this is the story of the convenience among us we have arrived at a three album. For the painting on the American lifestyle, pop-up, because this story about watching movie those at sea went through it with one discris transmite. America basically put in American teenagers vary street Beijing lit a lot of queens who are doing this with the same cool Just a 짱 that's writing and the corkkins downping Breakfast it's不是 Something Cars Karl everyone has clearly Thanks. Street and then one car passes, they say, game on. But I saw that, it was , it was a sickness from my first degree, and all the other trains. It was a sickness from my first degree. Because that was a mess. It was a secondary train system. And known as two buses. And my car is of course, the type of job that truly means well. Good job, fine. You can't run out and just run out. And you can't get any of you couldn't send me. You couldn't send me. You can't. You can't. You can't move. So that means you move. What's about me? You can't talk about me. You can't. You can't. Canadian's a poster everywhere in the American media. I'm wearing my clothes to a lion's marisette. But the question we asked in this article program is this. What? Canadians' rocks, top American top culture of the American medium-assured ones they have America's attention, what do they decide to do? Cancer discussion at the examiners to show that on first glance it seems to be essentially an error, couldn't hit more American. And then we'll heal us 902 now. Danny Drenett, who has the end-to-mement finitist 90210 weekly wrap-up and worldwide web. Here are music 902 and no is a kind of median frozen horse. Sure, it's based on the Canadian TV series, called the Grass and Eye, some characters to realize that they've been straight from the original series. Not one but two canakes, star and shell, have been rabbits in it, geese, crease, have pre-sleeved, slowly risen, after to the director and producer of shell. Once crease had control of storylines and content, yes, the inevitable hobbits. Canadian references start to show up and eye-known up to an old and various guys. One episode sees Steve Brandon and Joe meeting some girls from Canada and Jason's character Brandon and Walsh unnecessarily comments and where they are from. Perry sound home of all of Gamehockey player Bobby Orn who even remembers who Bobby Orn's, much less where he was born. Brandon's later comment is the Ogles of Girls from afar is O Canada. When a girlfriend's get jealous Brandon is , we just got truly a hooz in one episode for no reason whatsoever Brandon. me first in Manitoba. In the season for now, Steve makes the flowway statement that his American actor's mother is doing theater in Toronto. In yet another, Kathleen Roberts' character, Claire Arnold, called Steve a hose. Players often heard gratuitously attempting to speak mangle French. But the time when she wanted to say, let the best man win. In French, Kulimeyou Gai, which instead came out, Kala Melogal, and when I could only imagine his shout out to call back to something. Brandon. and one show plays in a charity hockey turn. We guess stars can't nearly run again. If you've got a few splinters from your stick in my jersey, can you see faster you're on good? I don't think you may want to forget to just grab. You want to get there in my blue life. That's gonna be fun for you more. But can someone please tell me who plays hockey and was? Jules, the fact is that in real life please the use to play central ambition to hockey team where his teammate was my country in France. It's all connected. Then there was a show that starts out within his... stream close up shot from Maple Leaf and Signia on the back of Brandon's shirt for two minutes before Brandon walks away. the show basically starts out displaying the Canadian flag. I mean, on their SEC laws against this kind of thing? Another show feature you clean in dance food, which is a stealth reference to Canada, or such dance foods are well known. Alex Trebek, former host of the Canadian show stars on nights, and current host of Jeopardy, which makes unmaranted reference to Canada more often than the candy. by a statistician. And soft stars in a Japanese dream scene is a minor dream come true. Most recently during the school television, Don and Steve were created to see reminiscent of the Nelson Eddie Jeanette McDonald's opera-ed-based movies of the 30s and 40s. In this case, featuring a Canadian mountain and his gau, singing Royal Canadian love affair. And have an enhanced feeling of enjoyer with a silence in his eyes. I am a great cultural reference. For Canadians, I mean at least get the American audience that clues to what you're talking about by mentioning Dudley-Doo-Royant's. Adding insult to injury because of hockey for noffs and unlike every other American-made entertainment product, 9 or 2 and now is often seen on Monday, 9 and 10. Two days before the Wednesday broadcast in the United States. Canadian friends in fellow viewers of the show have informed me that forads of Canadians cheer as these Canadian references to the rub. pollution of blockcast over American airwaves. How did we ever reach this point? I don't know how indeed Danny's running up the 902 when I'll weekly wrap up in the book of the New York Diaries . I'm getting to the editor Jack Hit has another searing expo's A on these strangers and not in its competing paths with Canadian heterogeneous. It's a big C-work. It goes without saying, you're getting to the mall, spy, shield, and considerate for Canada. All you have to do is watch this program. to week of the day President Clinton went to the rain forest. He got wet. He's not liberal and conservative. Jennings just seems to have it. Sometimes his reference is applied even to the arms. But Pentagon does say today and is very concerned about it incident involving the Russians last month off the coast of Washington State. He had a pairs that a Russian merchant ship directed a laser beam at a Canadian military helicopter carrying a US-nabled intelligence officer. He and the Canadian crew member both. had their eyes burned, though not badly. The Russian ship was apparently monitoring the American submarines in the region, for helicopter was monitoring the Russians. What are we being told by the story? It's not easy to parse, but it's either about innocent Canadian blinded by a defensive session, but a superior maturity can't, for not being directly involved in the two superpowers, now admittedly absurd arms race. So there is no question about where people's blood is gone. In fact, Peter Watt. the most comfortable convenient you must. This Freudian slips cry out. When we come back out, when we come back, when we come back, you don't you strain here? Do you have either strains to split the difference between a Canadian, or the American? Out? Let's see again. When we come back out, when we come back, when we come back, the stunning drop in the welfare roles. Let me come back. The space-stage technology that is already down in the farm. When we come back, you are money. Before he's heading out. We're going to begin tonight with a poison fighting center. Finally, the secret we're going to take you to Alabama. CPT is under journey to South Wales. If you watch a show, it's on us. I mean, very structured with show, as a sense of going somewhere, about the place, on this... Every program has its feeling zigzag, deep to some ultimate destination. And  where you want to sit? 6. Canada. That's right. Canada. But, actually, at the revenge promise to me, I realized this is not a journey to the proximate field of consciousness. Stay with me. See, Peter's news is noticeably different from the red book of those. Common Dancy of hostile world, the rupting of bad news everywhere. Full of murder, they have macho, dismal. Someone at hand. basket, fire and grip stuff, stuff, , very pertinent. Very good. Now, dance all clenched jaws, garrided coat and tie, the human-tiny bomb with this blood. Peter's just taken back. He could be wearing a smoking jacket. Drain from commercial sipping a mile single-mall scotch. Once Peter gets past ridiculed, where, go. It's odd. But suddenly, the news he's reading is in keen on his height. Try to watch him show him to shoot and leave his weed. Shooting. Shoot him. It's a new type of laser device that should permit a dentist to fill a tooth more efficient. And for you, you have to go maybe more comfortably as well. More comfortable dentist. Fine, that is good. But wait, you may soon be able to check for equal eye bacteria right in the supermarket. No more food points. The new obesity pill that actually breaks down fat. in the body. To understand the wrong meaning of this condition, one has to read past facts that we have to state. We get to the level of nostalgia, which speaks to us, the motion. To read feel it, if emerge the ads and the news, into one seamless and unfore yet, you have to step in it for reference. My down on down cover, let it wash. By creating sending spice with deeds, something into it. from some students who are very active. The messages, surrender, your time is over. My fellow Americans, a great nation is being asked to lie down and do that up. Peters' meaning is clear, even superpowers must engage in you and set them down. One of the airs that couple of times every show is for some America, as it's a set of songs on America. Ask about our personal. retirement portfolio, Son America, the retirement specialist. The tire. No commercial brake test. But of course Peter and his fellow travelers trying to dismiss his wife and my friends. Get in the gym and get in the way. It's okay, you see. Over time though, the message goes even further. I just retired. Even the musical score. Thanks. Watch the box. I don't think I'm stretching. You ready yourself? The messages. Let's go. Lost all the way to the same. The entire half hour is a kind of birdspin. Dark. Sometimes you have to tell yourself, stop. Look around. This is the good stuff. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I can't understand. Let's say I break up online. This is how it is. This is crap. This is a shroud. This one is a stop living around. We're dying here. See how obviously there's much to take off your rose colored glasses and see what's in front of your face. Once you tune in with this level, don't be a level. Each martial artist can be a friend. What do you  to go someplace to feel the relationship you're doing? Well, maybe you can. Some place safe and secure. Some place  America. We'll have all those tents in there. someplace  Canada. It didn't matter how Americans go, it's not  America. Move that in jazz. Frank, safe, and so on. death. Phone Peter, taking his step place, and all other have phone Peter. Phone Peter. Phone Peter. Phone. When we come back out, but when we come back, taking the anxiety out. of the fear. Take some. Sounds good to the story, though. Today the story that reminds us once again the things are not always what they appear to be. Jackhead. Back for, who's Canadian? Not a story of siblings, but a senior editor of Pop Tap in the sister's web drama, The tides get Marvelous, the corpse. Then, about 10 years ago, they both left and hit an opposite direction. He moved to New York City, where he's with over a cent. She began a series of moves to smaller, more typically, native cities in town. The cause of you, she is the good thing, is that they have one. All this hour we could talk about who's Canadian and what it means to be a Canadian we asked all to call his sister and find out whether she's to consider STEM. It's beautiful. It's not just the master actually lives, and right in the heart of the country. and where it's wonderful eight months and a year that makes me think of her as sort of the quintessential Canadian. And it's not even how ideal is that the place or sense of patriotism. It's more the way that she lives and can connect it to her, small community, her neighbors, in the natural world around her, working at her church and in her kitchen, in her garden. That to me is a Canadian art. And from my studio apartment in New York, her life in London. I think to her, I think to her, I think to her. I think to her, I talk about you often when I talk to people. And I talk about you as being my brother who has gone off as lived in the United States. And I talk about you as a great deal of pride. And people certainly respond by being very impressed. But there's that sense in which, , so I think if you came here, you'll be a celebrity and you'll be a celebrity and you'll be a success. You're my brother who lives in the United States and you live in highly sophisticated life and you live in New York City and everyone's deeply impressed by this. But you wouldn't be of us. You'd find things that perception would be very different if you had done the same thing over the last 10 years in London. I think you would be perceived as the more Canadian still than having gone to the United States. It's strongly a mighty If you had gone to another European country, it would still be perceived as being more Canadian than you would be perceived now. There's a way becoming of the place that the United States has a Canadian imagination that's going to go into a map in this country, special. Yep. Yep. Amazing. Yep. And what is that? What does it mean? Well, I mean, not to find a point on it, but I think some ways, I think, I think, I think, It's going over to the other side. What about when the other people do the dance lessons? We correct, let's just say. The tragic tragic tragic The tragic way of getting to Not mention the revenge just to really not be next to all places What was that line? Were you there when the jet was Yeah, I was it was just not pretty It's just not pretty I mean it's a real it's a really deep sense of law. I think and betrayal And Oh, whoever goes. And I mean, it's obviously not the right one, right? Me. But I think that that's, but I think there is just, I mean, so this is a sense of betrayal. But there's also just a sense of that. And a realization that, , that's the reality of the world as the economy that we live in. And, well, I don't know. Oh, maybe we're in this moment when another... Why. When all 2017, we talked about drug powerism since 2018 and we got to give him a project You are about to Nagui. I mean, India and I will not be the one who'll just be think of a brand of scandal. So I think only on a personal level. I mean I think only I don't think any of those sort of philosophical ways. I think I would feel different, no if you told me that you were going to have to decide to become an emergency. But I think until now I've always felt   you're just living there. Do the work in your hands, let's- you'll come back. Yeah. Or if not, if not even that, there, but it's still that you belong here somehow. , , any of us or you don't come back very much, that , somehow you're still pleased. I want to know if you're stuck in the fucking town. There's just no, I'm not. You need to go. Exactly. You need to go back. There's no people who... and really awesome blends. Yeah. ? Oh, don't worry. Right, that's just  that. Exactly. It's cool. Yeah. , , what? Sure, what? Oh, you're really just  us, but yeah. So, so that must be, otherwise it's cool. What if it's being satient? Yeah, I think that's really, and I think that's really a struggle for today. Travel for today. And in some way, I think it's a struggle that I honestly find what the answer is. Thinking some way of the answer is that a Canadian is someone who struggles to figure out what it is to be Canadian and not American. And all of those things, it's hard to make a village vote. I mean, there's that eternal problem of no. How do you make a Canadian? How do you make a Canadian village? And , kind of have made the answer open. Or to stop the end of it. And, ...
