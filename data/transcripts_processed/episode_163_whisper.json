But why'd she become a police officer? I think the police, because I don't  the police. I , well, , during the time I came to school, police officers always saw and my community were always male and white. The 6th floor was red and the police asked you to talk to you. you were human being. Everything is always parenthecational and always up voice officers is the biggest gang in terrorist. Just a gang, a band of who close the fantasies. And  always wonder, do they go around 40 of them  this, pretty ants in the paper, but she must have a band attitude and misuse reviews the sessions. Where did these people come from? So I thought we're on the other side. All those houses are there. It's that of the jungle. And so she joined the force. She tried to change the system from inside. And on the job she's so happy we're standing. to be the way they are, happily stand together. When they make mistakes, they never admit it , she says. We cover up each other's distance. I must have the time to come on to the force. These people come along with their own ideas, opinions, and then they would have daped these other people's attitudes. Everybody became one  a marriage. Because police organizations we weren't people for what? Everybody's been saying, if they're different, you're asked to say that. or we have problems. Ben and you get as much a wrong with Ben and you get to absolutely nothing wrong with Ben. That's not the problem. The problem is when you Ben and you are acting concept to lie, perpetuates the neighborhood and didn't have that's where the problem is. And you got that one little make-up first. We don't want to go alone but go alone because  we are a plastic gun is us against them We're also here We use abuse bill and that they make you refer to us against them I  the bill for I  the public at large So whenever Monica Child started on a new job at the course, she would get everybody know how she felt about that. It was always interesting because I tell her, Mrs. You don't mind covering up for anybody, but ever do, it's wrong and I'm asking about it. I won't tell you. I'm not covering up. I've been in a life. I won't even say I did see it and I didn't hear. I don't want you to lie for me and I want you to cover up for me. And then approach work for Monica Childs for years. Until finally 1996, it stopped working. And a life is a copy came very difficult. Today on our program, can you fight city hall? If you are city hall? We bring you two stories. Each of us somebody trying to change the system from within, trying to be principled while working in government. This is of course the July 4th holiday weekend. And it's a holiday about a moment of idealism that created the American government. I show today is about what happens to people trying to sustain that kind of ideas in today. In each story, public-minded public servants end up fighting their colleagues who takes a toll on their lives, they get harassed, they lose their jobs. Back one, take that copper, which anonymous cop tries to do the right thing, and a suspected murderer walks free as a result. Back two, man versus money. A small town mayor tries to keep a developer from building in his town, and it results in the kind of... Snowballing Fiasco by the end of which the town literally does not exist anymore. At least, Big O'Tell's that story. WB is Ishi Chicago and Public Radio International is a American  Amara Glass. Stay with us. At one, take that cover. Semana Kichard's troubles began on August 20th. in 1996 and 11 year old boy was murdered in 1994. And when she got to work, her commanding officer had a suspect in the crime, sitting there in the office. She or is me, she or is me to take his statement. So take his name. I said, now, try to get other people to squat to do it. Nobody else would do it because when she did it was illegal. She was trying to evoke me and something. And it'll be. It was illegal because her superior had made it improper promise to the suspect. She told him that if he confessed, he would be sent home. And she forces him true, if he confessed, he would be thrown in jail. And put on trial. Monica Childs finally agreed to take his statement, and the statement of another witness. But as their day and court approached, her boss could come into her office, asking what she was going to say in the hearing. She came in this office, I was sitting in it. She come in, she says, I need to know what you're going to say at the walk in your ears. I need to know exactly what you're gonna say. I said what the truth is what I'm gonna say. I want to say, I told you to straighten this mess up. I'm not lying for you. I tell you I'm not lying for you. I'm going to tell you the truth. I'm going to tell you the truth. Finally Monica Chowds called the press-feeding attorney and told him what was going on. And the suspect statement was thrown out. He not only went free, he sued the police department of the way they treated him. I want to settle them in for the key. $15,000. This man, Reginald Bines, says that he is innocent while charges. Meanwhile, Monica Chauds boss had her transfer to a job where she had no specific duties at all. Friends on the four steps speaking to her people she'd known for years. Police work as a kind of job where you work closely with other people, spending hours together tracking down leads, going over the pace, just any other company. Now this is gone. They were great. I don't want to get in the middle. of this, I'm going to see Tom and she. Oh, okay. Right. So, I wasn't angry with them. I wish I could have gotten the National Infirmary to come because I've never seen people walk with us back. And that definitely would have been an inquiry or a blow story. Take the same song listing. The names of the ones that they've rearranged last summer geb on Amazon. KLE parapher when the 27th of February were born in 2017... Retallation against the Civil War is so common that a Washington DC group tries to help government employees in the situation, the government accountability project, but at a handbook, warning potential with the Civil War is that typically they can expect any and all of the following, character attacks, threats, isolation, public humiliation, prosecution and trumped up charges, the elimination of their jobs, blacklisting, even physical assaults, which outsoed the police department, local press picked up the story, and in the midst of odds, this she got the phone call. Hey Miss Chaff, how you doing? Oh this air. Do you ever remember me? no. The guy turned out to be a murderer. Do you mind if the child said caught? I go, okay I said, well we're arguing. I'm in prison. Remember I got a light. I said, okay, but you won't. He said, we're the green about all this trouble and all these problems that police department trying to cause you. Please surprise our president. there to check too. I said, I was there to check this. I thought you weren't tired of having your own warrior. I didn't know you had your own, you had your own. Check this. You see. You see. Oh yeah, yes. It's about 12, 13 of us. We sit around. And if you need us to come and be, character wouldn't disappoint you. You'd get us out and we'd come down here. Because you was cool with us. We went to trial, you didn't lounge us. And the hand. I mean , I can get the cat. But we was wrong, but , I just appreciate it when you get me,  you didn't hand? I'm , okay, I already depressed. I'm already feeling bad. Look at all phones. I was friends, I was so bad. I'm , this is my health, 14 killers, people with no credibility, they go hell, make. I'm , okay, I'm , okay, okay, okay, okay. In the end, Monica Childs won her suit against the police department, and finally, sick of the whole thing, she retired from the force. The trouble with doing the right thing, of course, is that often it is not clear at what the right thing is, and just as often, doing the right thing has unintended consequences. Monica Childs worries sometimes, but the testimony that got thrown out because she put it down. Trins out the deck. testimony, might have cleared another suspect in the crime, a man named Eddie James, who eventually was sentenced to 70 to 150 years for the murder. And it just bothers me, we're probably bothered by that. No, just said, one innocent man, a person. And it was , how could this happen? And I almost wish I had said it to him, but then he would be misled me, not to be to know what's looking at himself. , I did the right thing, but he's still got hurt. Monica Childs, she spoke with a quarter-jumpo, who interviewed her for a book called Kid, that people would also teach jobs.

The story where the bad guys aren't murderers, they're real estate developers. Maybe not so bad. They're just doing what that intended for real estate developers to do, which is of course some of the town around a lot of money if people are excited. In this case, it caused a series of events which castgated out of control one after another. Until by the end, even the people involved, all seems sort of amazed at how far it went. And in the midst of this, it was yet another person, government official trying to do the right thing as he saw, no matter what. We speak against the story. When Scott Bradley moved West Lake, there were a few of the 10 roads and several of those were on the pavement. This was the 7th, and at the time, this love-loved development wasn't unusual for the area. It was country, low hills, and long grass, and not much else. Which is why Scott Bradley moved West Lake. Which is why most people moved West Lake. They wanted a rural life in a rural place, a short commute from the city. For it worth taxes was only 30 minutes left. But then the city grew. By the mid-80s, suburban sprawl had over-deaconless, west-laced neighbors. There were seven-elevens, home-deepos, miles of subdivisions, and all the other clutter were confined in any town in any place in America, but not in West Lake. The people in West Lake wanted something different. By 1994, when Scott Bradley became there, there was still no real commercial development in town, the town government wanted to permit it. I mean, they knew they couldn't stay off suburban sprawl for it. But everyone, the townspeople, town council, and especially Mayor Bradley is free. They at least wanted to try. The story begins in 1993, but one of the properties in Westlight, a 2500-acre ranch called the Circle Tade, appears on the auction block. This property, which, by the way, was the single largest piece of n***. and found and probably the most beautiful undeveloped stretch of real estate within half our commute of poor arithmetic class, then attract the attention of Ross for our junior. Son of the poor President, you can't do it. A high-powered real estate developer who was quoted in the papers saying that for him, business was about more than one of those. He was about win or die. So, Ross junior buys a circuit team range, and then a couple years later after a lot of signing in contact with Wesley's town government. He and his company, the Hill with Preparation, finally presented plans to the development of the circuit team to the citizens' blessed life. All can 100% live. David Brown is a Wesley breast and who attended the meeting. Hill with development, which is just a close company, had a meeting over here in Solan after at a big meeting hall, and they had pictures drawings of a beautiful little town that they were built. It showed little two-street buildings in the downtown area in its shape. It should have a very pleasant and not too crowded place and we were all delighted by the solid noise, but when you read the accompanying 300 page documents, you found it. It looked  it was in 50,000 people's family in here. The accompanying 300 page document written in the envelope of the Google speed basically gives you a route and this company they held with preparation, intranet flexibility to do with the town's less-licous day please. The fine print includes plans for a regional shopping mall, a scale home apartment, and office part. A golf course, zoning for a sports arena, and more. Three billion dollars for the commercial and residential development, with enough room for an additional 15 to 8,000 people. Now keep in mind that this is the kind of community we're visiting the quarter, need for instance. Could sit through a city council meeting where a full 40 minutes of the debate centered on the question of whether the new town sidewalks should be raised happenings or further to the ground so it's not to disturb the natural wanted landscape. So protect it. Once the residents of West Lake learned the details, they were profoundly disturbing and alarmed. The meeting room was hot, some say close to 100 degrees, but every town's person stayed to the bitter end, and according to Dunriting, another West Lake resident who had been to the presentation, there were all mad as hell about what Perrell and Hillwood preparation could do. In essence, we would have turned over the community to the development. In other words, that was the tone of it, is alright, I'll take it from here. people have been in charge of a run-down after this point, but now I'll be able to take care of it. We'll make you a decision-sport. That was the whole tone of. And people didn't  that. No, they didn't. Now at the time, Ross Jr. brought his plans for development of the circuity to this citizen, Wesley, the town was run by six men, the mayor, Scott Bradley, and five alternate. Mayor Bradley, wh- was a soft spoken but very successful lawyer with a reputation for staking at the ethical hydropower. meticulous, detailed oriented, Scott liked to stand at City Council meetings. Three different people told me that, but Scott probably would stand at City Council meetings. I think the reason they mentioned it is because the formality of that act, standing up, students such sharp contrast to the rest of the City Government. The other people on the City Council, the Ottoman, were not formal people. All are in the retired economic cave. who wore his overall student meetings. Fred Hell was a third generation hardware man. There was Carol Hunter's a former assistant football coach who later guns a oil exploration and Howard Dudley was in the chemical business and Jerry Moore who owned a tiling carpet company. I should mention here that being an ultimate and Wesley Texas was not what we call full-time job. For years, the city council meetings were held in the ultimate living rooms. Even when the city government moved into an official town hall in the early 90s, meetings were tanked that living room. feeling. It was comfortable, it was casual. There's not, in truth, all that much to discuss. Now in light of later events, it's important to clear on one point. At the time of the pro presentation, all five Wessley's Alderman were opposed to pro self-plan. Then something happened, and this consensus came through and lost you in your meeting another land purchasing account, Wessley. 500 days. Texas Prairie, on which one of the auto-in, a man named Carol Hunter's, rented a home. He was after this land purchase that suddenly and inexplicably, four of the five auto-in, Al-O-Yen, Jerry Moore, Howard Deadly, and Peros' new tenant, Carol Hunter's, started questioning town's traditional anti-growth staffs. There were a series of uncomfortable town meetings with a four auto-in publicly-chowned familiar and some statements were made to the local press. Miles Muffet is... reported for a restart telegram who covered what became the weapon story. Pro-purchased land hunters lived on and almost within weeks, and hunters and these other all remember, I've released signals that they were not tired of fighting, but they was time for the town to come around the probes and be used. , I got an interview with him and he began explaining that... Pro basically can't lose and Pro is going to have this way eventually in one so the town should come around and  just start the piezing. This term is hard to explain. These men after all had helped to build the town. For years they turned white developers with plans much more modest than Pro. Why would they reverse their decade-long anti-grove stance in a matter of week? We'll always take a look around how. There is that chaos, none of which could be substantiated, none of which that's why. Meanwhile Mayor Bradley refused to support the road plan and relations between the four alde and the mayor became stray and then passed to the hospital. There is a site of a webcam boundary cell in which each side accused the other of manipulation and deception . There is an ugly incident from one of the autumn's license and pounds people and a general sense things for the protocol of all you are. David Brown There was a great deal of academics, the citizens of the council and the people who read it. And the citizens who were even partial in bread, I mean people who called us, these guys all kinds of names, who do you work for? , who's paying the salary, who'd be sold out to this sort of thing? And, well, it was pretty hot. Well, quarter miles mark. And that point on, it was just pure bad one. I mean, these guys were calling around made in Scott was vetoing every action they took. back and forth and back and forth for weeks until these former Holderman decided to just put him on trial and relating to my office. They announced a very huge question for Emily and I for one part was bluffed. I was a little bit, I don't know. The legal basis for it was a law passed back in 1870s. They really did use watchgrams! why should be ever since early back to produce. But I thought we'll be back on the fourth. Yeah, it's  a hundred-year-old statue. And it says that a small town board of Alderman can be in a trial act as Judge, jury, and witness, and remove a colleague from office via the mayor or fellow Alderman. There are four counts of bread against the mayor. Two of them, so in fact, crunch. that neither the accused mayor nor the press, including Audemns, can remember what they were. One count charge to the mayor with removing a meeting notice which is supposed to be the 10 hall floor. The only substantive charge accused him of tricking the Audemns and hitting door scene at the end of town's boundaries. But most of us  residents believed the Audemns wanted to in each mayor Bradleyford different reasons. The mayor was the most outspoken and intractable upon an of the group plan. As mayor would veto power. It would be impossible for parole in the company that held preparation to proceed with development with Braviness standing away. When the issue was raised in the local press, parole denied influencing the Ottoman in any way. But a series of actions taken by the Ottoman only compounded this view. David Brav. Actually, they fired the city attorney who had the city attorney to the police. They fired the town's fireman, and they said, we've made a deal with fool with it, we're going to use their lawyer and their town's fire. But hey... The town of Newtown will get their services to free it home with the paper down. And the new offer came in, the new law year from the law firm that could be implemented. He immediately began to orchestrate, , Brad was trying. David Brown sent the Ottoman Muth petition signed by 125 West Lake residents, half the town's population, which condemned their move to Al-Smaner, Bradlin. As the Alderman's lawyers compared to the mayor on trial, Scott Bradley and his supporters began to meet regularly to strategize about how to counteract the actions of the Alderman. They would gather in their own homes, in their living rooms or private offices, and as they did this, they started noticing a strange thing in fact. This is Don Rettling. How I can tell you is the meetings that will help with enlightened purified people. that I was quoted from that meeting the next day from somebody that had no way of knowing what went on in the Jack words and the Jack sequence that we made in that meeting. Ruby Held, Blake of Autumn and Fred Held, the only Autumn and who continued to support me in Bradley. Whatever we plan, I bet it's true that everything is happening. So we know we will be in March, we will be in Lesson 2, somehow they were monitoring the phone call. This is managed for Ad11. Now you Well, we all started the number one, nobody would talk from the hard telephone. We would go to other telephone, just the top, or we would talk on the individual cell phones. And I myself would take my digital phone out, maybe family. What quarter miles mark? They held secret meetings out of the woods, and they would pass around notes. And they couldn't turn a conversation with the blinds out of them. Don, ready. We even drive as far as I'm forth from my way from my home and meet with them on the side of the road, did them on several places. And this is really interesting when we understand that in the early seven days I was working in the Soviet Union for IBM and that was one of the most close societies in the world, the KGB with Diffus, all this. And I frankly felt more threatened here than I did when I worked in the Soviet Union. We had so much threatened here that you felt  you were big. watched more. Really, no question about it in my mind. And if you can follow us, but it's only paranoid when it's not happening. In this case, no one's to be interested. We're be held without any her yard one day. She's for a watch. She says, Come on, Riner. She was tracking her bird with her benasters. It flew across the street, She noticed there was a pan driving slowly back in the park. in front of the home. The van had two people in it, and they too had binoculars. They were looking right back at her. Myos Mach. Well, she got the tag number, and we ran a check in the discovery that this van belonged to a private investigation service in Irving. And the next were Jerry and Jerry Davis. I got on the phone with one of the detectives, and he acknowledged having worked for the Chris Law firm at one point. and had the conversation really short. So the depositions later on reflect that there were in the investigators hired to track Bradley, but it just really difficult to tell who hired them. Prodenized hiring private detective to track hundreds of muslic. He and his development company, the Hillwood Corporation, declined to be interviewed for this story. But Miles Mach, whose covered progenyers business joins with insight and outside West Lake for a number of years, says, Renotion the Puro would have as a prominent tale is not a reality outland. Pro's, the way he gets about his business is generally very stealthy. And he acknowledges that to him business is war. And in order to understand this perspective, get to understand the stealth and aggressiveness, which is too very important factors in going the war. , a town of Tender and Bifu people. It's a very difficult time keeping up. Then there was another thing, which then flints the town's aircross for a junior. A book called Sitzen Pro written by General's Gerald Posner. Now this book is not about Ross Bro Jr., it's about his father, the former president of England. It's an unauthorized biography, which includes a chapter called, I'm not an investigative personality. About Ross Jr., now famous possession of security, and is used of private investigators and security teams in his business doing. Ruby Hell. There was some chapters I went for three weeks, a second email, between. I couldn't pick it up again with this. I thought I could wait with this news as long. And because I think I had read that book, it gave us something to come up in City Council or they'd come in and everything they did was I'd say that's chapter 6, so this is chapter 2. Every single home I visited in the Westway, had a copy of Citizen Girl. Well-worn full of underlying means scribbled notes in the margins, whole passages, outlined in the name of my life. More they read the more worried and historical debut. It is a misclimate of paranoia that the alternate put mayor Scott Bradley on trial. It was held on a Tuesday, in the cafeteria of the Solona office complex, which housed the town hall. The mayor's supporters clashed the walls with posters of the Declaration of Independence in the US Constitution. David Brown I guess the whole town was there plus. ready to have a big crowd for , , it was  Chinatown Street then. And Mr. Huttris was chairman of the, the, the town council, all the men sat as the court. All five of them, even though they had brought the charges and it even though water two of them testified against Bradley at the trial. They were still allowed the voters judges. My the element hit set themselves up along this long, at table. And in the middle of this, in the turning, named Bill Wood, he done some work for Peruv. Don Reading. And it was kind of curious because when something would be posed, the hunters didn't know how to handle, which was most of it. He would look for this attorney in the attorney with, try to advise him, which is, it was such a ludicrous thing, and it was such a stage thing. And if there was no question that was happening. Ruby helped. I'm sitting there thinking I must be in Russia. I cannot belay their sitting up and test upon against him in judging and being the true, the jury all in one failed slow. I thought this must be the way they railroad somebody in Russian, but it means this is the biggest product that bars that they were saying a lot. My whole inside, but I can't remember it. After 15 minutes breaks the deliberation board in a four-to-one vote with Fred helped me sent him a shot Bradley guilty of charge and dismissed him as mayor of the West Lake. The crowd booed. Scott Bradley. When the verdict was read, my lawyer stood out and said, is that your verdict? No, he said yes, he said. When the air you're going to put it into a fact and he said right now, my lawyer says right now And 200 said right now and proceeded to sign the papers that Bill Wood furnished him and I can't remember exactly how happy that there was a sort of a defining moment where it was just a spontaneous applause essentially aimed at my lawyer and me for having gone through the terrible situation. And now we're so moved that I stood out now plotted the audience for having born through this movement. Immediately after the trial, Bradley got in the car and drove to the district court house to pile an appeal. But all we got to call in itself. It was from one of the townspeople. A woman, steaked out of town hall, who told Bradley that the alder and his close another note, which he now yet another meat. Scott Bradley. She did pop in the mouth out of which she was able to read it to us and became very apparent in what was happening, but it was wrong to bother them. The alderman's noted, posted three hours after the impeachment of Mayor Scott Bradley, who ушed up the deer head . of 90% of the town's west. 90% of the city's property would be transferred to neighboring communities and the town would essentially be disbanded. Simply given away. Included in the disanization ordinance were all lands belonging to Ross Peruginier and the three properties owned by the audience. Reporter Miles Mothett. Everybody's , okay, they're just going to blow up the town on paper it would look. because the town was blown up. And these pieces, far-plung pieces attached by very thin strips of land. Where did the postings spread quickly? And within half now, a small army of citizens have gathered at the town hall, most two-stun-to-absorbered with the tapering. The properties belonging to the ultimate and throughout were eventually released to the city of Fort Worth, in exchange for a promise that they would pay no property taxes for a minimum of this. here's David Brown, Don Roding, and Scott Bradley. I was in prejudice, I said, they can't be dead. This is my same. You had no idea that anybody would have even considered something. This is unbelievable. Well, he and Srelie, you just, you're sounded. I really couldn't make sense of it. I wasn't there, but it had to be very much akin to dealing with people. It's nerve-me-me-op for homosexuality. Biling it was a senseless act. It's about only harm and devastation. And this is the same thing. I'll handle it just. Seeing the meaning work with mad men. Coming up, a mad man actually smarter than the rest of us. Happy to be with money. We did just plant things out better. At least we go straight from West- Texas continues in a minute, public radio international when our program continues. This is American Life in the Glass. Each of you are going to progress with course which is some theme bringing you various stories on that theme that is program for July 4th holiday. Stories of idealists in American government two centuries after the first and in today. And answers to this question. Can you quite city hall? are City Hall. In the middle of a legal story from West Lake Texas, the mayor has been thrown on office. Notice is posted calling for a meeting and the town would give away most of its land to other towns. At this point, Mayor Scott Bradley went to District Court, have an additional order, so his impeachment did not take effect. At the District Court, the judge suspended a murder trial for an entire day, the issue of Williams favorable to Mayor Bradley. A temporary restraining order would prevent the Ottoman women forcing. the enemies were also threatened and they indicated to the district judge that they wanted to appeal to the decision to the Fort Worth Court of Appeals in the morning. Mayor Scott Bradford. James is fine, I'll order my first to stay here, prepare the record you can come by and then you can send a quarter of height and pick it up. So, as far as we met, may be we were going to court of Appeals in this room. That night. Carol Huntress, in his lawyers, get into a father they drive to one of the justice's summons. They sit in his living room while he talks to two other justice's. He comes out in announces that he's going to stay in the orders of the district court. And so, in a late night hearing in a judges living room, the impeachment of Scott Bradley was reinstated. David Brown. It happened very quickly, I mean, the district court ordered to think about it. in my 11 o'clock night in the middle of the turn by the quarter of the field. And yeah, this made us feel we are really up against it. If people have that much clout, it's good and he was good with a little bit of nice. I mean, I could not, if I were in the pilot citizen and I wanted to get a just report order over turn. I could not go knocking a jet there. He was just going to the school at nine o'clock at night and said, would you please overturn this decision? I know you haven't had time to hear the opponent's side to it, but please overturn it anyway. I could be that. I don't even... in the state of the world, or at the very few people, obviously someone who does they do. Scott Bradley appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, saying the Court of Appeals was wrong to make this decision in the middle of the night without hearing the side of the case. And as other lawsuits involving Wesley worked their way to the Court of Appeals, Mayor Bradley filed another motion. This one said the Court of Appeals juggled. shouldn't be hearing another case involving him. Given how they'd handle the impeachment decision, they'd given the fact that he was arguing to this framework to date back with improper. The so-intriguing of the four-up debate again, the founding founding needy president, are giving me any notice, they were doing so. And then the entire four-up of four-up deals an issue in 21 page opinion, in which they essentially calm out lawyer, engine power. lawyers, suppliers, and un-tipped to the practice of all, the filing this motion, and referred them to the General Council in the State of Botaxes to have their license removed. And it had personal repercussions for me because immediately, 20 and hanged in law firm, others working for it. All me in, and they said, we have this $200 and $4 million judgment that were afraid in this same panel. that you said may be biased is going to decide, I repeat one favorably, in recognition, so we want you to resign and offer. And that's how Scott Bradley lost his job. Publicly provoking to me to deny any involvement in religious integration of West Lake and portrayed the affair as a local power squad. A personality conflict between Scott Bradley and the Board of Audemars. Three days after me, on Friday, May 2, one evening for the Tanne election scheduled, Tanne elections which could change the balance of power on the board. The citizens of West Lake once again gathered in Tanne Hall. This time, to witness the dismissing of their communities. With Bradley and the most democracy, there was no mayor to decide. The prior to the meeting, the Ottoman appointed their own mayor. One of the oldest instances. account. Again, reported my office. The same as Dale White. He's almost  a hermit and he just didn't Same around town to suddenly hear he was. Mayor of West Lake. Once again, the autoimmune took their place to table in front of the front. The meeting was by all accounts, a very efficient, no-fruised process. Most of the actual legal documentation that the same. organizations were provided by a lawyer who's working with for out in the mobile preparation. The Ottoman and the new mayor Dale White said very little, much of what they did say. There are some index cards which have been prepared in his fans. Don Rade. Do the whole thing people are trying to object, trying to get in the listen to them and it's , you must well not have been in the room. They won't look at you. They won't look at you. No. Scott Bradley. That was probably the lowest point emotionally in my life. Sitting through that meeting, watching these alderman, and the little and this mental breakdown, and about two of his own, period using darkness that grows lawyers head to prison. When the last people was signed, and the town of West Lake Fish. the mantle, the newly appointed Mayor Dale White. Mayor of a town that now did not include the property where she himself lived. In other words, Mayor of a town in which he did not hold residents sat at the table in the front of the room and made the statement he could appear in every newspaper article which covered the story. Scott Bradley. There were some maps this slide in several citizens gathered around. Dale, upset and harassing him, was this track the owner's track. He's my proper leader and he said, well, he's my proper leader. And somebody said, well, you call this now. And it seemed  without thinking, he said, pro-pan. It was in response to somebody's comments. And he said, this is below the alert. And people look very shocked and he realized that he had made a very unpolitical statement. And you can see by his actions, if you thought, oh, man, I just threw this up there's always one way, always, For everyone Companion, I'm going to bed that night as we mainly read the towns destroyed and the next morning at 6 a.m. in 7 months and put us in 12 cities. Emersions in session and in planes all around it have been decided that's been the quest lake. Now you don't look to put us in the council, out there at 64 on the service morning. Unless you have some cloth and yeah, we were literally manly used and literally afraid we might have lost the whole ball there at that point The autumn and naturally have a very different version of events a version they shared with me No hotel conference room several miles outside of breath rate It was the first time they collected to speak publicly about what had happened and the insisted In the end all the interview together. According to the alderman, they are the true victims of this story. People unjustly accused of selling up the town, when in fact they were simply trying to back breastleg to a corrupt and power-hungry mayor. Someone so narrow-minded and fanatical about preserving the rural integrity of his community that he rejected a proposal which was in step with the overall goals of West Lake in citizens. Former Alderman is outけどhood. Our attitude, everyone except... one-order and this one-man-re-here we have said it's gonna change the best we can hope for is a reason to change some input into the change rather than let them go crazy and for those proposition it's magnificent we will really fortune to have someone with integrity that would develop a town in a real-is-mo manner rather than just destroy most pounds one took no grads from grow, were never in any way influenced by grow. But reached their decision to a peach mayor Bradley after picking up the new do anything, including when we were working support, to stop a legitimate business man with legitimate rights and developing a property to let the zone. They described in great detail a series of small battles themselves in there, which led to their decision to a peach. And listening to them, it does seem possible that perhaps it was , is it there was a well? but the modest misinterested and some disagreements between the Thompson Bradley. Problems, they might have ironed out in normal times. But with the question of corrosive belt and expand hanging over their heads, these disputes simply spiral down a control, as each side dug in its heels. The Ottoman had run the town for years, and they weren't used to anyone disagreeing with them, so persistently and effectively. It was no wonder they'd be the new friends. As for the disanuation of West Lake's land, the Alderman say, the hostility of West Lake citizens was so great after trial, they simply felt they had no opportunity. They had an opportunity to release themselves from a bad situation, to release the corrupt people from unreasonable government, and they took it. But they don't agree that it was their fault West Lake was destroyed. Alderman found them. In essence, they destroyed. down when they were less changed the allegiance and had no concern for us whatsoever. They did after the time. They spawned at you and made harsh remarks at you and teach you  those really. Whatever the Ottoman's motivation, people of wetland's citizens' interaction. The Ottoman hits scheduled the disanization meeting for one night for the regular time election. Pruduma Blucke has the interest to adapt to the extreme trial. There is very little chance that you can tune in off. They were right. Of the two Ottoman eligible for reelection, one was drew from the race. The others just turned out of office and all that. Initially the end for a person to assume the election, which gave them a majority voting block on the board of Audemn, would end the political trouble in the same. But two days after the election, the old board of Audemn could yet another year. This one stating that a courting ceremony to the taxing election block, the new government would prohibited the constitution office for an additional five business day. During that time, the old board helped the series meeting in which they confirmed situations, passive and dampness. the community ordinance to protect the self-release with patient-related skin matters. And as a final act, this NF property which has a town hall. Meanwhile, Bradley, who refused to recognize the validity of his after, met regularly with a new board and systematic reverse every action taken by the board. David Brown. We had the old board of all of the refuse to give up his seats in the new board of all of the meeting separately, claiming they were the legal boards. We had Mayor Bradley claiming he didn't have to remove the mask from him. is legally available. He was still the legal mayor and we had the old council and they will write claiming that the old white was mayor because he was appointed by the council to replace with the Bradley. We had two mayors, two councils and a town that effectively had been destroyed. It was a mess right there. Two mayors, two boards and all of our towns technically didn't exist. Naturally. Outwards. Audeman Carol Hunter who didn't have a legal authority in the science speech sector created in a thousand dollars used a loophole in speed policy and wrote 67,1,000 dollar check to pay off a legal bill for social assistance with Mayor's treatment. Fourthing the town to raise its bank account and declare temporary bankruptcy. Dale White continued to claim that he was rightful mayor of Black Lake, changed some lock in the city hall to grab the in his quarters out and Bradley who off. also obtained to plan that used the right familiar of what  changed the lots of time. In the end, the question of whether or not Westwood continues to settle in the way that no one could have ever predicted. In the summer of 1998, rumors started circulating around town that a Fortune 500 company was interested in buying Persian and Burroughs land in Westwood. They wanted to build a corporate campus. and were willing to pay the day, but only with certain solutions meant. The company wanted to dispute between the grow and the time is all. They didn't want the land they bought, all within the jurisdiction of the city of Fort Worth, one of the land dispute cases then in front of the court. And there was one other thing. The land they were most used to combine, merged with Mayor Scott Bradley, and they wouldn't buy any man, unless Bradley also agreed to sell. Perough badly wanted to pay. money. And this put Bradley in the curious position of being able to dedicate to his former enemy the terms of the town's respiration. He did. In December of 1998, 314 acres of grandland were sold to the stability preparation and an exchange perou abandoned all the Galaxian against the town of West. The town of the restore. After two years of struggle, West likely saved by the very thing it citizens were trying to avoid me for a split. development. This did not diminish in any way, for sweetness of the Supreme Court ruling which reinsealed the Scott Bradley as mayor, which would deliver to Scott by the state representative between Twitter on April 9, 1999. They had declared that I was, and still I am in the mayor for the town of Westlight, and I mean it was just total screaming that you was screaming and crying. We were screaming. in the past. I think it's American's. There are a lot of people after that have the same that money and power will carry the day that our experience teaches us that most of the things that we have, that our experience teaches us that most of the things that we have, sometimes money and power does win and therefore there's more of a resignation to that fact and a willingness to succumb because we know every thing that's going to be the ultimate result anyway. And I think it's almost shocking to us when we find out that it's being stained that. And if you will fight for what I keep going right then. that ultimately it can when out even over money and pound. The people of West Lake know as assumed the Alderman had sold the town out for a money, but in the end there's no evidence to support this theory. Only one of the people, sharing more, so it is apt to corrode directly, for a price reasonably within. market range and no other evidence could go close and serve it. In the meantime, almost all of the autumn have moved away from leftway. They say it's just too hard after all that's happened in the town changed. How old is the old one who continues to un-property in the town? But says the most they could stand still. Sound-checkz. two years full of Wesley Ketter town back, and though many seem to believe, with Scott Bradley, the moral of this story is very clear. That right will, in the end, trump might, that money doesn't always spend. A funny thing happened on the way to victory.
