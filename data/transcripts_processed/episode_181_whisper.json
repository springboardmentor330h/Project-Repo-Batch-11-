The story of how Scott Carrier got on the video is one of those stories. Here's what happened. Scott was living in the solid city in the New Zealand. Great, his marriage is coming apart. He had a job painting similar in our practice. He walked away from him. But from time to time, we knew he was listening to my specialty. great story on the reading, on the public radio, who thinks himself, hiking back. And so one day, Gotham's other tableholder, and walks to the highway, and stuck at his tongue. And he, the headquarters in Germany, Washington, and anybody who's picked him up and gave him a ride, he entered him. So, quelques it andろly drives towards laughing in the street much more. and some of you will be surprised for There's a telephone lobby that you don't need to stop calling in. Then, most of the week-longest-sittered outlets have happened to two months, and some of them in Scotland, you just arrived here, hitchhiking across the country. Now, on the steaks, we  it. If somebody would show me the practice, they'd use the way. It's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. Most people on the radio sound  jazz. Now, to the same way that most TV sound , other people want to be those radio. Those radio sound , all the other radio sounds , Scott sounds only  himself. This is a feeling that it's storytelling. It's  anything we've asked about. So today we're going to do something different. We're going to be bringing you an entire hour of stories and one trip here from Scott Carrier. We wanted to try this, try this, Scott. Because there's just something in this set of stories where when you put them all together, some how they're seeing to be telling one story, that's the best way. Some WB's is Chicago. It's this American line, distributed by public radio information as well. I'm Eric Glass. They shall stories by one of the most interesting people was the Central Department. of that section the word of free time and accuracy from the numbers. So how do you deal with it, hah, what've three minutes ago? How would my brain react? A legal standpoint? That's very about it. And then in my 예, I'm comparing prolonged finding out that this is the new brand on the roof. i want Well a couple of your stats got carrier was hired to interview men and women in Utah who diagnosed schizophrenia. He got the job because the director of the research project heard some radio stories about these hidden stories. So they talked Scott to administer this test that measured mental health. It was 100 questions. Each of which was scored this level 1-7. How are they given to us? Scott was made $30 for each test to get it. People who gave the test to? Not my doubt. I was hired to interview man and women in the state of Utah and receive Medicaid support for treatment of mental illnesses, general diagnosis, schizophrenia. I had little understanding of schizophrenia before I began and I have little more understanding now. I took the job because I had another took the job because I just quit my study job. I was professional to all after realizing that. what I wanted more than in, was put my boss on the floor and stand on his throat and watching gag. Then my wife moved out, took the kids and everything. She said, I thought about it. I really think it's the best thing for me this time, by life. And so I took the jar and then my own schizophrenia clinics because it was offered. because it's all there seems to be. And it seems somehow predest, harm it response that could not be avoided. It would only be temporary, something to get through the sun. And I was told that they needed someone moved to drive around the state through the small town, searching out individuals who were out in transit from the height. I  to drive. I  to travel. And I  the idea for soup. So I took the job. Did the job? Bye-bye. will never be the same. The patient is 21 years old, who has moved through this parent since his discharge on the army. He has no friends, no recreational activities, no social life. He spends his time writing reading, but these activities do not give him any question. A person will not be safe anymore! as general anxiety and loss of libido, an occasional feeling of unrealistic. He is worried about his unpredictable behavior. For example, getting down on all pores and chewing the grass because he was thinking what it would be  to be a cow. The patient is 25 years old and believes that she is the devil and therefore is responsible for all. evil in the world. She's not allowed for half for seven days, , it comes down from the room for meals. A few days ago, her mother walked into her room and found her crying. She asked her mother what was the most painful punishment that one woman being could put upon another. The mother tried to get the reason for this question. And the daughter mumbled something about the devil having to be punished at the benefit of humanity. Something about having to die for this soon. When the mother asked her if she still thought she was the devil she answered. Let's not get into that again. It only upset you and don't believe me anymore. Even when the evidence is all around, claim for you to see. The people I know that you are also sad. So long with such things so, if I go to some demons who invade their hearts, or sucking their souls down. A person's soul should be  an ocean that is schizophrenic souls that cool the brain and the parking lot. They suffer. They are completely alone in their suffering. There's nothing I can do. Nothing anyone can do to bring them back. I come home at night and cry. I stop  three-year-old. Today, halfway through an interview with a man into a lot of recess. I have a crystal in my pouch. Do you want to see? I say, okay, and he takes it out. A normal crystal decides if a large paper. And he says, I can look through this and I'll tell him what are your good personal or bad person. What do you want me to do? You want me to look through it or not? My first thought is to say, do you want to go on with the interview? Maybe when we're done, you look through the crystal. But then I realized that he's really asking me to take his text, just  I'm asking him to take more. I come into his heart. I ask him very personal questions and I expect him to answer honest and why shoot it? So I say, okay, go ahead and he puts the crystal up to his eye. Turns it clockwise and counterclockwise. That's what I'm looking at. And he says, I can't tell for sure. I'm going to have to read you my ear. Take my hand. He holds out his right hand with the crystal rest of the hall. I take his hand. put his left hand over him or in squeezes at tight shakes him and goes into a small spasm. Then he lets go and sort of sits back  he's exhausted. He asked me if I felt anything and I said maybe a little and he says, I sent you a message, I put it in your mind, I told you what is wrong. And that's supposed to figure out what's wrong. of these people. I'm just supposed to ask the questions and score the answers for more than seven. This is partly because I'm not a doctor and might get something going that I wouldn't have had a contained, but it's mainly because my supervisors weren't tuned at it. They were all people asking the questions to be doing it in the same way. I'm not supposed to give a motion of, I'm not supposed to let the patient get a motion of it. The therapy part of the counting mental health system is in another department. I wouldn't even know it. and I told more than once not to worry about it. It should never have let him take the crystal out of the spout. I drove around all day trying to find another home there. He lives very close to four corners. The cross where you talk, call me Adam, Mexico and Arizona and me. South Dervos, how I'll say be five miles or so. No address, no call. I stop at every house and not on the floor, but even nobody's home and nobody's lives. I fly down every part of houses and ask directions. And the people offer complicated directions that I follow is best and possible. Sometimes drive 20-30 miles, but it's always the wrong place and nobody's home, that it just isn't a house there at all. Driving in there, I think about how I have some of the same problems people are interviewed, I'm angry, depressed, crumbed, apparently not the musicians, and I worry a lot. Up to now, I thought these were common problems, and that I was more or less able to control. But now, I don't know. I feel  I'm just faking. You can just don't really dislike what you will. Yes, Eso, podr course, not really doing things for family or someone else. for at least I think he's the man. I'm a third of the way through the task before our relicies not recognized. When was your last visit to a mental health clinic? I don't go to the clinic. When did you ask the doctor? I don't have a doctor. Do you blame yourself or anything done not done? No. Do you thought most of the happenings are unusual? No. Have you heard voices or other things that weren't there? Are there other people from here? Or are there other things that aren't there? And he says, I think you want to talk to my son. And I ask him what his son's name is. He says, same is mine. I come back to next morning to interview the son, Kitchie. They make coffee for him. He has a broken capsule. His house has no reputation. The son is 19 years old. A good looking kid. Oh, help him. He says he used to run across country and high school. He seems to be fine, but as I go through the questions he starts to fix his eyes on my, a direct, almost hypnotic stare, straight in my head,  he's trying to pull me in and trap. I try to look back to look just as deep into his mind, but it's  looking into a cave. He says he hears voices, satanic voices, and that he worries a lot about his shoes, that they're not the right time. Dr. Kai, you see the MTV. I can't tell if you sit, or if you're just trying to torture. And I drive away thinking, I don't know anything about this disease. But I know even less than what I started. I spent two days driving around and I made 30 bucks. And I feel really, really tired. The house is dark as all the windows have been curtain to open the shut. Curtains over the big picture window and living open just a bit. And the light cuts through that the lazy view, it's the red shank part. Throwing up small, gust particles, cigarette ash. The view is the way for the light. The old television is a slice of pizza wine upside down. and interviewing the woman from other, and her teenage daughters on the phone talking to her boyfriend, for a rather a series of boyfriend's. We call, call, and all of them wanted to go out right now, but a mother loved letter. She's trying to answer my question, trying to concentrate, people , but she's mainly listening to what her daughter is saying, well, and we'll suddenly switch from saying, no, no, I think he and her partner haven't had a relapse in months to screaming out. Zed, John, I told you. never to talk to him again. Who is it a boy? You can't go out. Tell him he has to come over here. I can't stop looking at the slice of pizza on the park. I keep looking at the slice of pizza because it's the one who's the one who's sick. I mean, she has a teenage daughter dating house. Maybe she shouldn't try to wear makeup today. But these in her accessories are always symptoms. She gets a friend. She seems to be far just one hour. I'm tired get to the question. If he been wearing a line, she says yes, she has, she's a hornol line, that the others of the church, the moment church, will take her daughter away. And I asked her why, she says, because she stopped taking medication. And I asked her why, because she stopped taking medication, and she says that long and recently she takes it, because she told her, that she was visited by the archangel Gabriel, and that she had sex with. And then she was also busy. of the body-archenge of Michael, and that she had sex with both of them at once, and that they'd ravished almost every night. So her bishop made her go to a doctor, and the doctor gave her some pills, and she took her pills, and the angel stopped coming. The bishop and the elders had told her that she had sex with any more angels, they take her daughter away. So I asked her again why she stopped aching in medication, and she said, and run, and missed it. I love it. to come back. Today in a restaurant eating lunch between interviews I decided to take the test and answered the questions and scored myself appropriately and at some point I realized I wasn't doing so well. I decided not to even add up the points because then I'd be left with this score and I'd never forget it. I would have riding a port on myself to sound something  this. Patient is 36 years old and lives alone since his wife left him three weeks ago. She took the kids and all the silver were except for a large night at a goal in the coffee cup. The patient admits that a leaving may have had something to do with the fact that without warning, he completely got at the house, throughout all the walls and scenes, all the glass and glass. down to the start. He says he did this in order to live  a primate, for an ask that he was successful. He says it was the first step in the right direction. The patient is a 36-year-old man who lives alone since his wife and children right in two months ago. He says there's a darkness that separates him from other people, heavy darkness by looking at a person from the bottom of the realm. He believes that if he could say the right words, then the darkness would go away. He says he sometimes knows the right words, but cannot say it. Other times he can't even think of the words to say. The patient is 36 years old, it moves the lungs, it's his wife and children left in three months ago. Last week he went fishing in the side of the lungs. Now who leaves that there's no better fisherman than himself? He says, I can't tell you about it, because talking about fishing is so bright, bright, bright and app-dancing at the same time. All I can say is I've walked around in the water, and I know the instant official jump of the flock. I've had open their stomachs, squeeze out the rods in my hand, study what they eat, how it all gets digested, even the episodes scroll through the moons. He says he was sick before, but now he's... Okay, now is the final, just holding the rod in his hand and it cured it. His house is clean, the electricity is on, but while it's a bit cheap rod and pain and why he says, I have to ask, make and maybe she'll come back. When the dream is ended, and passion has flown. I travel all along the coast. Back to the Sangley Nam. There were three kids, there's a house, there's marriage. What's got one, it was a steady job. The bosses he did not hate, and he did not hate him. If I let job, for a short time. In commercial radio. There are a lot of bad ways to wake up, but surely one of the worst things by looking into the floodlight from a police car. I was in a field, some farmers feel next to a power plant just outside Mullins' cancels. I was sleeping there next to my car before driving into Kansas City in the morning. The policeman saw how saw my car from the road and it pulled up right in front of it and I didn't even wake up. I was lying on the ground and passing to the city car when I did wake up. one of the policemen was in the R.C. I guess looking for drugs and the other was 40 feet away in the hay here. And I remember why he was out there unless he had his gun pull, covering his partner. He said I scared him when I woke up so suddenly I sat straight up, boom, away and I met him every shot with the head. I wanted to know what I was doing sleeping in the field and I told them that I didn't  motels, which was on the apartment room. So I decided to tell them that I was born here, or else, but that I don't live here anymore, which was completely true, but somehow didn't achieve the level of meaning I hoped it would. They asked me what I was going to do in Kansas City, and I said I was going to interview the mayor at 11 in the morning. I told them I was a producer for a radio program. Told them the name of the program, the name of the host. and they hurt everyone. who he is as well, if I would say his name, but I decided not to say his name. Friendly men instead, because this is his persona. I told the policeman that every week they mourn the friendly man has a five minute fee of one of the networks and twelve million people listen. The stories are as a rule, upbeat, and positive. The general theme is people taking responsibility to their lives, their community, their country. The friendly man, oh. has good news and the good news is always that America just keeps getting better and better. Both policemen said they'd heard of the programs and that they liked the friendly man. So they decided they liked me as well. It was okay to sleep in the sleep. Sorry to bother you. I was hired by one of the friendly men's executive producers. Her job was to wrangle and corral radio producers  myself. from around the country, into conducting interviews and writing scripts for stories that have been found by a block of computer researchers, also from around the country. Some people are surprised to hear that the friendly man doesn't actually produce the story as he tells. In a reality, he just doesn't have the time, but with the television show now and the special soar. It's not that he doesn't want to write a story, it's not that he can't. It's just that he's really busy now being the friendly man. He shouldn't expect him to come up with a reason. The way it works is that the friendly man is in New York with maybe a couple of editors and an engineer. And as executive producers in San Francisco with backspot machines and email and the researchers are all over the place looking for story ideas through computer searches. When the researcher finds what looks  an appropriate story, he calls the people in the story in the form of toxic or cold wild. Any right out of story synopsis which is sent to the criminal or a clue book. Once approved, the story goes to a producer's and charged with conducting basically the same in a Gonzalo Verge on tape this time, and then editing the tape and writing the script, which is reviewed by the executive producer of San Francisco, and sent to the Fremont Man in New York City so he could read it on the air. The first story I produced for the Fremont Man is in Tucson, Arizona. These are about some people who were helping to make America a better place. It doesn't really matter what the story was about, but matters is that I had to do all the interviews over the phone. There wasn't enough money to send me the two-star. So I found an audio engineer who two-star had him go to the location to hold a microphone up to the subjects while I talked to them on the phone. Then he sent me the tape, which I edited, and then wrote the script. Without ever meeting the people I was writing about, for the person I was writing for. Well, I made a suggestion for changing the story. I thought would make it better. The executive producer said that she would try not to get upset with you because this was my first story and maybe I didn't understand my role. The story had been approved as written in the synopsis. There would be no changes. Not traditional narratives or discoveries. I was but the writer and producer. One of many cocks in the field. I apologize and did the story as well. After this first story, I asked the executive producer of Hacker Corps on the road, driving around and collecting interviews, actually meet the people and see what they would do. Then come back and produce the stories. She gave me four stories, added distance of 3,000 marks. They'd paid the mileage, but we'd give you nothing up front. Food and lodging could be my expenses, so I was sleeping out. It was the first week of July. So warm at night, you could sleep up. on the grass without a bag or a blanket. At 11am, at the morning after a kiss, I was standing on the mayor's office, on top floor of Kansas City, Missouri, New Circle building. To tall built, built one of the highest fields in the area. So looking out of the window, I could see most of the city, buildings, river tracks, and the river. And we'll see the river make no big box. right to terror. We sat at a long wooden tape, a conference table, tall chairs. Mayor of Magna, Cleveland, also a Methodist Minister, Black Mayor and a Black town. I come to ask him about a summertime midnight basketball program. The program,  all midnight basketball programs, was designed to reduce the crime rate by keeping juvenile's off the street. And right with some of the other programs, the crime rate hadn't gotten better except for the time kids were actually very fast before. Whenever there was a game going on, crime rate in neighborhood was lower. The mayor's opponents were saying that the program was poor, that the $100,000 a year could be better spent somewhere else. I asked them about this, and he was adamant, even passionate about the value of teaching kids to play basketball for any team sport. He said that team sports teach kids the best values, that they learned to cooperate and play by the rules. They learned to problem soft through cooperation. And by playing they learned to love the game. And through the love of the game they learned to love themselves and each other. He said that a few of the kids had gone to college on basketball scholarships. And this gave hope to everybody in the community. Community were hoped was  a foreign language. And that alone was worth it, even a bargain and a hundred thousand dollars. He said, you got it again. Smothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. You'll see the whole community there. He was right, over on the East Side, the poor side of the pair, their game is going on in a community center, and the place was packed, and the games were good. Little 8-9 notes passing the ball and making them plays run in hard the whole game. They love the game. I interviewed coaches, kids, and parents, and everything was going far. Things really were getting better and better in America. But then, just before I left, I was talking to a f***. about his son and somebody I think probably was a kid took my three rechargeable batteries and it did a lot of your tape with the marriage interview on it out of my bag and out of the bill and they would go the batteries were $250 to be replaced but the interview with the marriage was lost for good. Some of the kids looked at my bag and these things were  eggs and a basket and they went older would just take them to bed. I walked around the neighborhood for a while, tried to figure out what to do. The next day was a Saturday, and I got a Dominican office, which would mean that I have to wait for Monday, but I had appointments for interviews Monday morning for another story in St. Louis, two hundred miles to the east. Then there was a fact that I've been robbed while doing a story about it. program that reduces juvenile cry. The story has was written by the research on the synapses, it's all about how black people are proving their lives and making things better by a vast of them. But the reality of the situation at least the way I saw it was that these people were poor, that they'd been poor for a long time, and that they were probably going to stay poor for a long time. So I called the executive, this, after a message saying that let me read some of your comments myself. consider scrapping the vast fall story, and that I was going on the St. Louis in the color from there. The story in St. Louis was also about four of Black people. Only in St. Louis was about old, poor Black people. Old, poor Black people lived in a nursing home, and had started their own private economy, where they get paid for helping each other out by washing clothes or cooking meals, reading reading books and stories out loud. time, but they didn't get paid in real-mer, they got paid in what they called time dollars, which could only be exchanged between themselves or cashed in at a special community store for food, clothing, and other necessary items. The old people liked the time dollar program, they were much happier than before they had the time dollar program, at least this is what the research riddened the synopsis, and this is how things seem, for most of the morning I was there doing interviews. My first interview was with the woman who'd set everything up. She was a well-educated, popper-metall-class white lady who worked for a large charitable organization as a local manager of its program. This woman was very nervous and I couldn't tell if it was because she was just nervous being interviewed, or if she was nervous being surrounded by core black people, or if she was just nervous by nature. I talked to her for a while and then she introduced me to some women who actually participated in the time dollar program. And they told them that they do things  how I hold people around town and ask them to be located. They're sick, they're suffering. Or they clean dry neighbors' clothes before he goes into the hospital, or cook for someone who has bad asthma. And then they could use the time-dollars to buy stuff he needed. They were friendly ladies, and it was just  it said in the synopsis. Neighbors, helping neighbors, and getting paid to do it. So I asked them what we could go over and see the store, the place where they actually buy everything. and they sort of hemmed and art about it. Said there was a key, half a get it. Then we were talking about grandchildren, arthritis, the weather and Mississippi. I was wondering if maybe they didn't really wanna go to the store. So I asked again, and they said it was a couple of blocks away and there's raining so hard. It was a little worried at this point because the store was in the synopsis. And so there had to be some tape up the store in the store. So I explained my predicament to the women and they didn't even know it's going to work out. So it left it empty from here. And now I'm going to tell him about plays. All of that will go into the store for a while. So excited. So when I started out with this way, as best I could and could go there. We brought some umbrellas and walked over to the building that house the store. It was a one story warehouse, brick and concrete, few windows. Inside, we went down the hallway that separated two large rooms. Each packed with desks and office people, stacks of paper, stacks of folders, desks and lots of desks, lights, people typing on real-time breading. All that in. machines, it was very suspicious. Once I looked  the Bulgarian foreign trade department, the other side,  the Lithuania shipping commission. Down at the far dark end of the hall was a large metal cabinet in two pooling doors, closed by a madla. Whenever ladies open the law, the inside were four shelves. Top of bottles, fabric, softly. The next was full of baby wipes. Another had some paper plates and plastics of the were. And the bottom is full of bathroom door to run. that was it. That was the story. I'd imagine something between a 7-11 and a strip story and I didn't understand. I didn't understand how any of this was working. I stood there and looked at the cabinet and the story disintegrated on the baby wipes and pickled forms. I think the ladies and less the building and call the executive producer. I didn't want to tell her about the baby wipes and the fabric so I'm going to know there was no use in telling her that something was wrong, that maybe the whole story was a sham, but I did want to ask her if it would be okay if I left the store out of the story that maybe the story should be that these people just  help each other and that the time money thing wasn't so important, but she never let me get to it. She was upset. Very upset about the message I left on her machine Friday night. It had ruined. her whole weekend. She was distraught and nearly hysterical. Everyone was distraught and nearly hysterical. It was my fault. My fault to have taken my eyes off the equipment. My fault to have been wrong. My fault to have left her without completing the story assignment. She said that I'd let her believe that I was a professional, but no professional would ever behave in such a manner. She said this twice. Subtext being that the family man can only use professional producers. In a their qualist file. Unless maybe I went back to Kansas City to re-interview the mayor. My job was to do what I was told, just as their job was to do what they were told, just as a friendly man's job was to do what he was told. Because the audience, the 12 million listeners, had something they wanted to be told. That America is a good place with decent people. Never mind the screaming coming from the basement. So I got in my car and drove 300 miles west of Kansas City. I could've told them to go to some, but I didn't. We were back because I didn't want to be fired by the friend of man. I've been fired by other less well-known friend of man, and it's always  being brand-scored as the one brand. I was tired of that. I'm tired of being broke. I'm not having any work. My wife, my family, they were tired of it too. I decided. I wanted to be a professional, I wanted to be a team player, I wanted to take responsibility for my life, my community, in my country, I wanted to get ahead and go someplace with my career and be happy. I drove back Kansas City, got in late at night. I drove through the big buildings down there, the streets lit yellow and fake, drove through the poor neighborhoods, the streets lit yellow and vacant. I drove along with parkways, pass-foughts and parks, and I drove past my grandmother's house. down to the country called Plaza, where I slept without a bag or a blanket on the wall, from a long, aspirin on one of the Nelsonard Museums. If I was to be bothered by the police, I would tell them that I am a radio police looking for the criminal man, and that I have a meeting with the mayor in the morning. Let me up. You can call me Ray or you can call me Jay, but I don't want to know my own. name, thank you very much. And Niji, I want to be forgets to forget. Also, sixth grader remembers to remember, most stories from Scott Carrier in a minute, a public radio international winner program continues. Let's a American live, my regards. Show of course, just a theme. Let's go ahead. Today's show, the friendy man. Stories by Scott Carrier. We're devoting the full hour to Scott stories because they're just great radio stories. and they sound great and you just want to learn another each of these stories which we appear on different so it's our radio shows back. There's a point where I made a little collection piece on a CD and I would keep you in the comments. And it's something that we realized, oh this, this CD would be a really great hour on radio. So that's basically what we have today. Scott is just one of the great original voices we're hearing. We've arrived at X-V of our show. tech 3, who am I, what am I doing here? Sometimes all we want to do is forget all we want is ignition. But of course real and niche, happens a lot more on TV movies, it does work . In the movies, , people are constantly getting bogged on their head and getting to the yard, and the park on the sewers, man, tap the ventures, teach them who the TV are, but does that happen? The amnesia pilot. Is it really such a thing as amnesia? and does it work  that? Have you ever met a single person? Saddamisha. What few years back we had this American life wanted to find out. The answer to that. It's got a great help. The idea was to find someone who had an easier and asked them what it was  in real life. I was worried that it might be difficult to locate such a person. That the approaching may in reality be my friend. But that there was at least one known and easy to have lived in, and I couldn't see it. Another in Pennsylvania, the particular cities and addresses could be found if necessary. None senses. I'm sure I'm not a bad idea, Newsy-Ans. This city breeds forgetfulness. There must be five or six amnesiaats in the neighborhood around my office a long time. I accepted the offer, thinking that would be an easier sign. I began by last one of everybody I saw, they had or had, I never had, I made this with three. days and I tried not to be select, but to ask everybody with my community partner to whether my wife or the checker with the grocery store . Do you have or have you ever had a museum? And Furthermore, I'd ask this each and every time I saw the person, sometimes two or three times a day. No one admitted to currently having that museum, but at least one for a remembered being not hard on the head and losing memory from a concussion. Just kind of that museum last only a few minutes or a few hours. and concussion stories found out are usually not worth listening to or worth telling they usually go something  this. I was in a football game and two guys fell on my head. I kept playing play the whole game and everything but then after the game I had to get a right home because I didn't remember where I lived. I heard this story three times from the same person and each time he told it to me in the same way with some difficulty as if something had been taken up. him and he didn't know what it was. Two people admitted to suffering from drug induced amnesia. One had a drinking problem. The other was myself, as did it fact that when I was 19, ate a big, psilocybin mushroom right off the ground in the mountains of Columbia, South America. It spent four or five hours where I didn't know my name, where it was, or why. I was hallucinating while the sky is. floating, he grabbed bubbling up under my feet, the trees and bushes were throwing off little packets of flame and brightly colored orbs. I wandered around and round and cawpastered, holding my hands over my eyes, to wear this. And then a man and a cheap big me up, and I thought he might be my father, and I thought I knew what he was saying, but I didn't know what language he was speaking. And we went to his house and watched the soccer game on television while his wife, who I thought might be my mother, served as coffee from a metal tray. back out on road and I walk up to a park sat down to a picture of myself and open and below the picture I wrote these words. I'm still here. This gave me an insight into what an easier is  real amnesia. I don't remember what they are. In three days the classes I came to find someone with amnesia. She was through a young woman who's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a physical therapist and one of her patients had her head smashed in a car accident. Her amnesia is kind of the opposite of what we normally think about. She can remember things in a distant past just fine, but she doesn't seem to be able to remember what just happened or what she was just thinking or just where it was going. So she can't for instance drive a car or even ride a bus. I asked my friend's daughter if I might be able to talk with his woman. And she said, well, I guess so, but you might have a better conversation with her dog. I came back to my office feeling a little down, finding an amnesiaque was proving to be more difficult than expected. I decided to seek professional help. I got up out of my chair and walked across the hall and knocked on the door of Dr. Jeff Harris, psychologists. And he was a guy and I went through it عن the door. Then it's up in some series action. Going from one APC to the next. Each one got blown up as he was getting in or not on exactly how he survived both. About that, two. Basically getting light out, he being on few survivors, he can remember he can remember his past he can come where he was walking. That's cool. Sorry dude. repression. You don't remember something else. I'll just fill the building. Don't say it pain. Let me ask you this. Say, I have the ability to make you have an easier. 5. Flip this switch. You won't remember your name. We're not remember who you are. What is it? What do I say? I will do it. I would do it because then I think I would lose my ego. I would have a clean slate. And it would, if all of a sudden you can remember why you're all this much, so that you're not looking for the way I ever, why you're talking to me. I say it's disoriented with me. That would be... I think if I would be smarter to realize this is a gift. I mean there's two choices to do. You realize that it's  a gift or you completely freak out. I don't know if you have it. But your talking is, , you wake up before you go to the party or you're going to go to the party or you're going, and you're happy with it. Did you get a break? That's still seems attractive to me. It's still seems  my big thing. To be putting a situation I have to admit I'm completely. last seems  quite a few already years. After five days, having not known her hat had an easier, I decided to visit her hypnotist Diane Bradshaw. Masker, she could give me an easier. She said she probably could do it, as long as I was willing to be. put under a few horses. She said some people just weren't willing. And if you're open to the possibility that say, amnesia would be okay five minutes or one minute, it might happen. Well, I'm open to even a day. That's, I don't know, would that be a bad idea? What are you really willing at? You want to get that extreme? Let's say a few hours. Think what do you think? Because he's gonna have to hang out. Yeah. I think I do have a half hour family, you would get a pretty quick. Right now, half hour. I think I have a half hour, probably, 20 a.m. Now, I'm going to ask you what do you want to forget. I mean, I can do anything from giving you a suggestion if you get your name, if you get where you live to, , what do you want to forget? Awesome. To forget everything. My whole self I do. Is it Mars? Well, I... She took notes on what I wanted to forget, and she hypnotized me, which involved having me carry backwards from a hundred and telling me to relax deeper and deeper. And then having me imagine being a big garden with a stream running through it. She said if I drank from the stream, I forget my name, where I was, and also the name of my friend who'd come with me. So I went and drank from the stream, and she woke me up. I've opened the eyes all the way back and I'm just coming up and I'll just all the way back. Hi there. How you doing? It feels pretty good, doesn't it? It wasn't pleasant. Yeah. It was hard. Yeah. I can remember. Sorry. And what is he doing now? What town do you live in? Salt Lake. I'm sorry. What have you been doing today? Working on this story. I'm sorry. What's his name over here? Trent Harris. I'm sorry, man. I'm trying to try the name. The next day I typed an easier into a search engine on the World Wide Web. We got a phone number for the Beckman Institute, a neuroscient center at the University of Illinois. I called up and talked to Rob Altau, a graduate student. Me told me the Beckman. The kind of amnesia I was looking for was indeed very rare, and that there's some disagreement over whether it even happens at all. He said people do suffer long-term memory loss from severe brain injuries, but they usually these people never recover their memories, that the brain doesn't regenerate. And he said that the other kind of amnesia, where there's no physical trauma, is often a matter of the person not wanting to remember, but one psychological reason or another. And then in these cases, it's really difficult to know. the person is basically just faking it. Talking to Altoff, maybe wonder if I'm an easy, the kind we see on TV and in the movies, where character gets hit on the head with a coconut, loses itself identity, then spends the rest of the story rediscovering it, getting bonked on the head by another coconut. Whether this is really just a story that we want to be true. Everyone loves the idea of a second chance of starting over without the burden of the past. I think that's why I'm using so many movies and TV shows and moments novels. We somehow want to believe in it. And the wind is a key to see more. Keep your colors. I'm gonna jump for a better name Keep the memory Let keep your heart at your heart Now forget me Please don't forget me I pour May get easy May my mom die General I think you were working on an animal story and mom was doing filming or something. You, bed each other and then you walk each other and then you walk each other. I remember sitting on my front steps in the morning waiting for her to write up a healer It was in the spring late April and it had been raining. Steam coming up on the streets. I was waiting on the steps and I realized that I was in love with and that everything was going to be different now. She brought up a hill, set her bike down the grass, we go inside, she lived with me there for a long time, maybe forever. I knew it. Saw the whole thing come, just  I see everything there. The only thing missing is the end. I remember lots of times you were nice to mom. I mean, she told me once. that for her birthday for Christmas or something, you bought her perfume and you wanted to get her the right one and so you wear around and you had a sample of eight and you're smiling and you were deciding what you couldn't decide which one to give her. And then when you come home you hug her. My house inside had no furniture, other than two chairs and a table. It made some coffee and moved the table over by the window so she said. the sun. He was a modern dance, small, and very white cotton glass, no need for a brown, shorts and sandals, and sweating a bit more right. The skin is dark and already so rude, lovely legs, but the glass of scars and his shoes and feet that were little creatures under the sounds. Beautiful, right? They had the structure of the golden girlfriend, inarcomfort. with built-in springs and polishes, agranto stretching out the purchase. Do you feel  anything's a mystery? Between killing me, being on an understand. This week when I asked her and letting her go, just this question, she paused for at least a half a minute. I've asked maybe a million questions in my recording career, but this has got to be the longest column I've ever heard. I don't really think about it much, but it's a hard thing to think about. Because it's... You usually don't pay much attention to what you and mom are doing between each other. But kind of... I don't really wonder anything. I don't think that there's something that I don't know that I really want to know. The mystery or anything. I'd seen her dance the night before in front of a small audience down there. And her style was wrapped around the idea, her idea, that she really weighed nothing at all. But her body was only... there to tell little jokes, for little jokes, whatever might come to my heart. I asked her if she liked my house, and she said she liked the view. She asked me what I thought about her concert. I said I thought it was fun. She said funny, only funny, funny, and beautiful. I said. And she said, that's better. Do you think Hillary and I are in love? Yes. Yes. Sometimes you sometimes have fights. I think people who will each other have to have fights sometimes otherwise they don't understand each other very well. They might not everybody is exactly the same as all you might disagree about something right. But two people who love each other have to understand each other and understand each other they have to know what they think. Up until this. time I've been living alone and was not on half. I had a house in a dog in a car, no job, no need for a job. I had money from the national endowment for the arts to produce a radio story about chasing analog, which as far as I can tell, only required a whole hearted effort to live as much  a primitive run as possible. It was a problem I was working on by myself. And really, I had no idea how to go about it, other than by trying to live simply, and by trying to stay up. side cover as much ground as possible but there she works finally arrive come to stay I mean I don't believe we can ever guess the future or  I can hope but I never I don't sing little dran to be in a girl because she won't allow. She asked me why I only had one quote in the kitchen. Said it was all I need, and then asked her how she had her kitchen. And she said, at least ten spoons. But I have glasses, different kinds, even wine glasses. I  to have friends. I  to cook, have friends over to eat. But you and me friends. Yeah, I have a friend. But he doesn't have any hands. I said, let me over it, my God. , she said, I've been dreaming about you. I think I'm in love with you.
