Some eight-degree roll sale, typical for you eating, coaches, sets or following. Celebrity. These are transmissions from the police scanner. Little radio the size of the walkie talkie takes up nine-one-one dispatches. Fire. I would throw the police, there are lots of people in this manner. There's been many guys, sorry, I've learned how to correct the victim. I'm put running the neighborhoods and , you're listening to the app, you suffer, , running and talking is making the same time and , you're a band and a breath and  a lot of times you have here, , an object happening and the vigil and at the same time you're talking is my, and you can hear the struggle, you can hear the screaming, you're yelling, swearing, you are there, what's left with you? How an other party trying to get the patient to vomit now or trying to circumnacess it. Do that. So that he is actually sleepy and love coffee. It's legal to listen into emergency transmission likeness. But there is an entire invisible world, thousands of lists passing through your body right now on radio waves. Signals from Saigothounds and Cordless Founds, Military Transmissions and Baby Mounders. voices that you are not supposed to listen. I have a hard time accepting that. I think that's me. If it's traveling through my body right now, , why shouldn't I be allowed to listen to it? I don't care how sensitive material is. If you're transmitting through my body, I'm going to monitor it. Today on our radio program, people who are talking. to make this invisible world visible,  this man,  many others. And stories of other invisible worlds, from WB EZHCHKO, public radio and national, it's a American life in our glass. A program today, seeing the invisible world, stories of what is all around us all the time, beyond sight. At one of our program, faster than a speeding bullet, people who figure out ways to hide the 80 foot radio antennas in their backyards. The monitor, the radio voices that are passing through all of our bodies right now at the speed of light. And what they know that you and I don't know. Back to more powerful than a locomotive. , we've all been in conversations where some things, some truths just hovers in the air. Unced, everybody aware of it. In this act we examine just how powerful that force can be. With case examples from David Starris and Carrier Serval, Brady Dutong, Lance Matherchang. I create a bit of weep-tile buildings. This is the story of a man who sneaks through back hallways, searches abandoned subway stations, crawls through miles of train pipe and in general goes all the places that you are not supposed to go. And what he finds them. At four, look, up in the sky. My friend, what sort of incredibly sophisticated species are we? We are species. You can form the existence of one of the basic building blocks of our universe. A subatomic particle, curdling here from the sun all the time, we had to use some of the same materials that we would use to remove a stain from a tie. Stay with us. That one, faster than a speeding bullet. Well, it took a while for our producer Alex Blumberg to enter the community of people who listen in on the invisible world at the neather reaches of the radio spectrum, so much of their listening is illegal. He found a guy to do. I'll call him George. We met over in New York. He said he knew lots of people who involved in hard-porn monitoring. It legal stuff. But he wouldn't get into the details. He said he didn't want to elaborate to him that the person. I expected a sunlight to perhaps mold him. Freak, stalled with pH. But George pulled up on a red sports car. Who were backwards baseball cap. I liked him. He said his father bought him his first radio. I'll write you a little bit of a radio. am transistore. When it was four or five. And from that moment on I was hooked. I every night , from the bed, I fell with it, , and I died out. I died, I came to the static noise, . And I was loved tuning between the actual audible stations. , it was also, you didn't hear that station ID. Several states away, , sometimes , what I would have recorded half  us country. And this is being ordered to me, it is the signals. to tell me such great differences. At age 10, we went to Radiation Act. We got his first scanning radio. One of the tune frequencies outside the normal FM and the amps. In those days, the instruction manuals that came in the box actually told you how to use the equipment to ease your up on cordless phone conversations. In Cell we got that time. in the new manufacturing manuals that was – Sega super high. I would be one of the more important things to monitor. So that's probably one of the first things I've seen. I know I came to it for sure enough, there's several. Does this a neighbor's lab in a way, , he's talking about the mayor of the situation. The eminence. How are you feeling with this new food? See, there's this little something that I mean, I imagine this to them. I mean, just for emotions, is there listen? What would they? Actually, again, you remember I was very young to stick to height. Mr. There were no fixed versions that were just... we didn't sighting. The George Codbord, who's neighbor's marital spouse, is radio collection grew to include declassified military receivers, shortwave radios, old motor robot walking talkies picked up at flea markets. He would listen at night to new bands, different frequencies, fishing through static, hunting transmissions and everything. Bye-bye. I had just begun to put a little bit of a video that evening and I just thought lucky. I just was just too fortunate to spend that evening and very, very, very, very, very this listening to me all the sudden years, I think, more is the background, , you can kind of zero in it, find it exactly what frequency is. And then when you realize that you have a less-than-continradiator, you can zero on that frequency. I pulled out the mud and he did understand what was being said that it was a rescue operation. I heard when the individual was there, they were called and I looked it up and it was obviously a cyclist for the helicopter and then they took place in the office of Florida and pulled out and pulled out and he did not go very well and they did not reach the individual. you're there. Time, time just starts to go something then. It seemed  I, , I've been asleep for half a minute. Maybe two minutes, but I have to let sleep to talk. It's been a while. It's been a while. It's been a while. waking up in the dream. Especially when you take a headset off, and you need to be able to, whatever you can do, and I just set that stuff and play it head-to-head. I'm just, it's a big reason. For two decades, George has been entering the stream while nearly every day for hours, mapping the terrain with a group in that spectrum. The portion of the spectrum, that almost the best of millions, and doesn't to be an openingsC, where they're in a group industry. This takes you to where you can't reach a Nationに five years, and as for the first thing available at a national level, which launching the Ring uncertainty teams, South America, or in many different fields and various challenges in time, they also have five flights of latitude to have three, and 거야 to!] already, I'm scared, whatever. They're just an extremely small green scene on a massive beach. And in the exciting stuff is really out of sight. It's a world that can be heard about not seeing this stuff. It's a serenity, it's a world in one big pond. And , people have to realize that it's... It's vast. It's astronomically huge. Again, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I haven't used scratcher surface. I haven't begun to get grass on everything itself. Now, here we have total of five antennas. The top antennas was called a Grove Scanner B. It looks  the television antenna. The little one, the work of this kind one. This is one of George's idols. George says Morpheus lives, breeds, and sleeps radio. Morpheus is backyard, the Chinese say, tennis. Three in the youth eats with a different purpose, and two more that went from the house underground where they come up with the base of the tall tree. So that comes out and these days they are approximately about 80 feet up the tree. Look up the tree, back there a little bit, you might be able to see him. Pena, don't mind. flat black. It's been paired with their original colors, which is a nice shiny silver. See up there for a while. It's afraid that if people would see 280 foot antennas from the street, they'd break in and still is equipment. Inside, Morphi's crimes most of his gear and beat up set of wooden shelves. They're right next to the bed, where he is life's sleep. So if emergency channels start chattering and you open a night, you won't have to spread a half here. He shows me a computer that, incredibly, gives a real-time read-up of every city and counting for a user-to-way radio at that instance, from state trooper to municipal grounds. He shows me portable radio gear and a safe where he stores two high-powered assault rings. Then he steals into something he calls the great book and all knowledge. What we have here is a very large serving binder, a few inches step for what pages at numbers and old notes. What this is is a compilation of pretty much everything I can see from this person's reference. I can pile this since I've been in the years. About 18 years with a little bit of anonymity. This covered with I.R.Pitchless DCTD, which means this will offer you some sort of music. It's a little bomby here. This really is the... The binders  a phone book. except instead of last names, there are five and six digit numbers representing frequencies. The next of each frequency is a brief description of what it's used for. More fierce flips through, page by page and points. This frequency is a pirate shortway. That one's what commercial airplanes use to communicate with the control tower. , see, , see, here of course, pick them, pick them as a quiet. Some ring tower type, you can listen to them. Oh, shortwave broad gas. Each one, this in the military actually means that he points to a whole range of frequencies, taking up a page of two in the binder. The air forces global high-frequency system is this. The most powerful shortwave communication system in the world. It enables jets over the Pacific, it's talking jets over the Atlantic. If you get lucky, you can tune one of the frequencies while it's active, from on the assist. You can often hear the roar of the plane engines in the back of it. But you're not likely to understand with it. the pilot to sound  them. And what they do instead of encrypting their signal, such that  all you would hear is static. Instead, you can hear everything that is say, but it's quoted. they'll say, , Joker one, Joker one, we have a message and then this code comes out one. Bravo, delta two, nine, one, Shirley, box spot. You get the idea of doing. What is it mean? Who knows, that's why they encoders. This is a typical, this is quite obvious. It's a private number of our website news. It's stuck now, and we're in more fuses words. Hot Rodding Americans find. And one of his five cars, black money cartload, beat miles to the hell. We're called jump. That's the term for pleasing. and on board scan looking for action. Very quickly, we hear a promising squat. We're stuck in the line of cars at a broken traffic light. And there's no way to turn around before we get through the intersection. We can go one-off to the limit. We're in light traffic. Finally, we make it through the light. But before we can turn around and head in the right. direction. The listening for certain words, pursuit, structure fire, accident. But after an hour of driving, we've come up with nothing more chase. We all get a little bored. For fun, we scan some non-emergency frequencies. What a offer, boy! What a offer? Yeah! It's a offer? Yeah! Good bye! Over the course of a week, I made a bunch of these best. They all noticed antennas everywhere they go. They also swap recordings  they want to play the, maybe with a scanner. Of a madame at a Canadian escort service taking orders and dispatching ladies over a cordless phone. And they all complain that the things they hear over the airways and... might never make it on the news next day. I kept thinking that people with access to all this information would want to do something. On either side of them, tracking police brutality or uncovering government scandals on the one-hand stealing credit card information on blackmailing, blandering, self-wemperation and hit it. But they don't. They're not that cheesy about what they listen to. What's thrilling to them is the simple marble that voices throw the air past through us all the time. I don't know. I guess... With all of these radio waves and you can follow right now, I feel  a radio sometimes. You feel  a radio? Well, we're all in tears. I feel  a radio. I feel a two connection with these conditions. I even enjoy the system too. and open carry and our gistatic. It's static. It's the essence of the way. It's the pure energy of whatever it is. I don't know what it is. It's a radio in with that. What is this? to see some sort of special moments. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. At the end of our long night driving around, we stopped the one last snack. We were having fun. We were just talking about joking around, creating stories. I've offered the guy in the mirror space station talking when he buzzed over head. That's pretty wild. , of course it's all in Russia. You heard the guy in the mirror? Yeah. So yeah, we understand lights. We have these deer daivers. They punch one up. We pulled out of the parking lot. A Monte Carlo doesn't guess. Street lights at the end of the street lights. You can someone's got to follow the AC. Satellite, then. I'm not ready. Out swimmer. The AC is a bit too much. AC too. What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Whether this week's show we were all talking about various invisible forces that are all around us, forces that we usually don't think about. And somebody brought up the idea that one of the most powerful forces in the room can be the thing that is unspoken between people. , when there is compensation, there is something that everyone is avoiding, knowledge and saying, feels it. And you feel its presence with this intensity that is all the greater because the thing is said. The unspoken thing just can't be hovers obliterating all the things that are active. being said, it hangs their immatorial, unspoken, exerting a dense emotional force to you. And we thought, in this program we tried to make other invisible forces visible, let us make this one visible as well, then to do that between five writers, asking each one for a story about some moment when they felt, present, or something else. I'm having some pain in my two, my upper right rear mode, so I call a dense one I've never been to before, and he says I can come by. that he'll take a late lunch. When I get there he tells me the truth is that it's going to need poor root canal, so he says. I can do them in 45 minutes. Some guys say they can do them in a half hour, but it really takes 45 to get everything to a good job. I wrote it out for a burger and do it right now if you are. I say, yeah, okay, and ask him if he has any nitrous oxide. He says he has some, but he doesn't usually use it. It takes a few minutes to set up the sets. But if you're the squeamish type, I suppose we could pull the tanks out of the closet. squeamish, squeamish. This guy's been a drill four small holes one inch below my brain and he's saying I'm squeamish. He's about my age, a little chubby, wearing expensive golf clothes and a gold necklace. I want to tell him the f*** off, but I say, yeah, I want some gas. He tells his assistant a young man to set up a gas and then walks out front-ass and asks his secretary to go get him an RV's roast beef sandwich. The kid straps out in the mask and I start taking slow deep breaths. Trying to fill every cubic inch of my lungs. I start feeling almost immediately a subtle separation of mind and body. But then as comes back and shoots my jaw with another cape and ask if I'm feeling this. I . and say, no, not yet. He tells the kid to turn it up and starts to drill. I inhale long or deeper . I inhale and then hails and it seems  I never exhale. Nitrous oxide is amazing. Nitrous oxide is my very good friend. I hope to leave my body and float above the chair. Wow, he drills the catch. with his young assistant. He says, so I hear you leave him for South Carolina, where a kid says, yeah, in a couple of weeks. At first I think he's going to wait a college, but then the dentist says, well, say a lot of President Benson for me. He's a great guy. And I realized then that both Mormons and the kid is leaving the go-on-is-mission. I live in Salt Lake City. I grew up with Mormons. All my Mormon friends were not missions. I know the host. deal, how they take 19 year old boys and screw them up for life. What I was younger, I was more tolerant of their beliefs and practices, thinking that this is America and that the Mormons can believe whatever they want, including the notion that God promised this land to them, and that they are his chosen people. But as I've got nolder, I've become less willing to put up with it. I don't believe that their patriarch Joseph Smith was visited by an angel who showed him where some golden plates were buried in upstate New York. I don't believe the plates were a record of a people written in, reformed the Egyptian Harroglifix, which Joseph Smith then translated through the miraculous aid of a searstone, an abresquate, packed device he called the room and thumb-up. And more than anything, I can't believe I'm letting a man who does believe in all of this still small holes in my head. There were no golden plates. There were no golden plates. There were no. Golden place. The dentist asked me, how's that gas tube feeling no pain? Both he can get the assistant flat at me. I grown,  it's not working, and again he tells the kid to turn it up. I take a long, hard, long hit, and it's all settled now. I know the dentist is a Mormon. He knows I am a druggy. But even though we just met, it's  we've known each other for 25 years since we went to different high schools together. Back when he gave up Master Bating in order to get into the celestial kingdom, back when I gave up all respect for authority, tried to be found forever. He knows he doesn't  me, and I know I don't  him. And we both know he's charging a thousand dollars an hour first time, and that I will pay off the bill very slowly. Great zoom, see you, hun! Jesus comes back. A woman I once worked for came to Paris on vacation, and we went for lunch with a little restaurant on the corner from my apartment. We just sat down when she cleared her throat saying, I don't know if I retold you this, but I really didn't think much of your last book. out of nowhere. It was as if she'd looked on the menu and read that the chef's suggestion was to tell someone what you really thought. I won up to her saying that she couldn't have hated the bulk half as much as I get. And this set the tone for the rest of the afternoon. Both of us agreeing that my life was decidedly second-rate. After our lunch we were standing in front of my apartment, her deciding that the building was unremarkable and me conceiting that, yes. said, was, we said goodbye and then she lurched forward, subjecting me to a hug, which I really wasn't expecting at all. I never hug anyone if I can help. To make things just that much more awkward, I was holding a lit cigarette that proceeded to burn a hole in her obviously new and first great jack. We both knew what had happened. She caught me staring at the hole, and then she caught me getting my gaze and pretending to be lost and fine. It was clearly my responsibility to acknowledge what had happened, to offer the pay for the code or at least to apologize. I was close to cracking and then I decided that while it had been my cigarette, it had definitely not been my hub. And so we stood there for what seemed  hours. One of us introducing a possible conclusion and the other one rephrasing. We'll all write that. Okay. So, well, gonely, gosh, what do ? Still married, I ask him on the way to lunch. Unfortunately, he answers. He laughs, I laugh. Sorry. The only thing we say about it is being married, me wishing he wasn't. The both of us wondering if this lunch is such a good idea considering the feeling they both get and round each other. I have an ulterior motive for this little get together. My hope is that by the end of the lunch, I  him less. We have a lot to talk about, a lot in common, music, movies, history, books. I avoid these topics and steer the conversation. words politics. He's a Republican, and let's just say I have an LBJ key chain in my pocket. Actually, he's a libertarian, which as near as I can tell is just a Republican who doesn't believe in God. He's really excited about the flat tax. The more he goes on about the flat tax, the more thrilled I feel, because I'd loath the flat tax. I keep nodding along. -huh, really? All the while I'm telling my- So, see, I can't fall for a flat taxor to flat taxes about greed. I'm about civic duty, tax and spend, tax and spend. It works. For what is less sexy than the mention of Steve's forworks? I run through all the usual issues. Unfortunately, we agree about abortion and gun control and education. Ashto. start going soft, gottering on about assault rifles all the while noticing his hand, resting there on the table, so near my own. It would be so easy, so quick, it just reach for it, his hand. But there is that wedding ring on one of his fingers. I look up, stare deep into his eyes and say, so you didn't happen to vote for Ross or else did you? My earlts sun found a wig in the garbage dumpster this morning. I walked into the kitchen, highly irritated that I couldn't make a respectable night in my green paisley tie, and there he was at the table, eating cereal and reading the funnies, the wig pulled tightly over his head  a football helmet. The wig was a dirty bush of curly blonde hair. The kind you might... on a prostitute, or someone who was trying to imitate Mal and Monroe. I asked him where he got the way he could be told me, his mouth was full of certain. When I advised him that we don't wear things that we find in the garbage, he simply continued eating and reading as if he didn't hear me. I wanted him to take that way, but I couldn't ask him to do it. I forgot all about my tie and going through it. I looked out the window where Mr. Fels slowly understood. I paced into the living. room and back, trying not to look at my son. He ignored me. I could hear a munching cereal and rustling paper. There was a picture, or a memory, real or imagined that I couldn't get out of my longing. Last spring, for the accident, my wife was sitting in the chair where now my son only sits. She was reading the paper, see how the black ox did the night before, and her sleep must air was only slightly longer and done. the heart than the hair of my son's weight. I wondered if my son had a similar picture in his head, or if he had a picture at all. I watched him and he finally looked up at me, but his face was blank. He went back to his wing. I walked around the table, picked him up, and held him against my chest. I pressed my nose into that wig and it smelled not  the clean shampoo scent I might have been hoping for,  old lettuce. Suppose it didn't matter at one. My son put his smooth arms around my neck and for maybe a few seconds it would together it knew. The three of us. Before my grandmother died, she brought my sister Sally and me to fortune teller in Chinatown, who never made mistakes. My grandmother believed in fate. She believed that the twists and turns of our lives were mapped out at birth as clear as pages from a book of standard plotlines. I, on the other hand, was a Russian wisdom-esceptive. And Sally was simply distracted. She was the beautiful one. She was getting married and she had her own mom. The fortune tower was a tall Buddhist monk whose huge bald head startled me. He studied my palm, pressed my hands, and peered into my face. His eyes were shrewd and bright. In that moment I forgot I was a rationalist. I wanted his opinion. The fortune teller and my grandmother faced each other talking rapidly, leaving their hands. They spoken as Sichuan dialect I could not decipher. My future floated through the air in inaccessible words. I waited for the translation. Maybe I would learn who I would marry. Maybe I would find out if I could pursue my ambition to become a narrator. After several minutes, a month turned back to me. said in English, you should eat more slowly. Eat less oil, exercise, then he back into my sister. I stood with my mouth open, furious as he spoke to Sally. Eat more slowly, eat less grease, was I destined to die of heart failure? The monk was holding out on. The more I thought about it, the more I had to know. But my grandmother refused to talk. She would ignore my questions and plan to self-applic kitchen table, spreading hot pepper sauce on whole wheat toast and shaking her head. In the next few years, I could only cry from her a few vague pieces of information. And what I learned wasn't comforting. She said, I would have money. and fame, but that my luck would not be staying. She especially wouldn't talk about Sally, who had always been her favorite. She has peached blossom luck, she told me once. A few months later, my grandmother died. Since then, I've asked about peach blossom luck, but the explanations are never the same. Too much desired, someone once said, and I wondered what was wrong with that. It's only reasonable, since my sister's divorce. course that I've begun to see how complicated being desired is. Nowadays I live a rational life. I write in the morning, I meet my sister for lunch and we talk about our relationships. We tell each other we need to learn to let go. Step-China can tell the outcome. But in the back of my mind, I'm standing with Sally in the darkened room of the Chinatown Temple. Trying to piece together words in dialogue. I'm listening for the answers to a most important questions. Answers that have joined the great catalog of things I'll never be able to. I'm more  my grandmother than I thought. I believe those answers exist. They are our fate. They're encoded in every word I write. In this swinging line of my sister's dress, they hover in the room around us, waiting to be seen. In order for parents, writers, Scott Carrier, David Sider, Sarah Valverde, Udahl, and Nancy Memphis, you'll never know I can't. You'll never know the touch I've been. You'll never know it for I won't. I'll show you, I'll know you never, never know you. You'll ever, you'll be. Coming up, scientists stumble out of problem that cannot solve. And the only thing they can think of is an active pure faith. Somewhere they decide, somewhere, who must exist in invisible particle. A tiny particle with no weight and no charge in man, they go looking for it. What they find, another unlikely story of how the world is put together in a minute from public video to national, when are programmed. It's American Life, my or glass. Each week in a program of course, which is a theme, I'm very merriety of people with tackle that theme. Today's program, seeing the invisible world, stories of the unseen forces that affect their everyday life. And what happens when we finally see, we've arrived at a three of our program Act 3, able to lead tall buildings. On my friend, I hold in my hand, stack of scenes, sub-publish magazines. They are called infiltration. Subhead, Redner Needs says, the Zine about going places you're not supposed to go. And people write into the Zine from all over the world, mapping out their adventures, clowing through construction sites, deserted buildings, steam tunnels, under university campuses, the big article show on UCLA, subway tunnels, and in subway stations, drainage pipes, catacombs, plus, if that were not enough, the back hallways of hotels, hospitals, office buildings. and article is one of the band's missile silo, who was one of the next co- guy who puts the scene together does not get out his name publicly, but he did agree to the interview from the Stone County Toronto. We have been sneaking behind the edges normal visible world for years. About three or four years ago, I had to stay in the hospital for several weeks one summer. And while I was confined to the hospital and was in the lab, I believe I got very, very bored, so I took two. exploring the hospital each night I would walk around and I had to do a little faster than no plastic slippers and just see all the secret sites of the hospital. And what's the thing to do for me? We just see one more thing. I found abandoned wings in hospital. It's higher wings, yeah? So that was really fun for the gotchets for all the rooms and see where patients had them kept in the investigate all the wonderful tools they used to build. and point down to the more of the engineering levels, manage to get up onto the roof, a few different places. You've devoted an entire issue of your zine, infiltration to this. And at one point on on page, a 12, you have a diagram, four photos that sort of step by step instructions to the reader of the photos says, to visit F-Wings locked elevator room, go up this ladder, and just put it over the ladder. And then there's another photo, and I'll climb through the door out onto the roof. of Shadow the Wirs, find this open window, shadow the open window, lower yourself in and enjoy and then this in the picture of the locked elevator room. Yeah, it was really crowded that one. Because listening to the worrying and thanking the time that door was definitely mad because it's always locked every time I chat. Eventually I found a nice indirect move to get in the house quite a different place. And then once you lower yourself in and enjoy, what's it mean to you? enjoy that. To save her, it's you take the pictures proving your conquest and you get to understand what was behind all those sounds that you heard from the other side of the door. In this case, it was sort of an elevator room, so I realized that the reason for that was random patterns sound was people were summoning the elevator at different times and showing up different numbers of warriors in Scotland. I'm very sad. What do  about this world that is invisible to most of us? That the rest of us don't know. I don't think I understand it that it may have a different person. I really am just keenly aware of its presence and impressed by that. Suddenly very extremely becomes. somewhere I'll pick up on or if I'm walking over a great I'll try to figure out what exactly I'm walking on top of. I never think that great is something to kind of look down. Will you actually  lift up a great and  where your stuff down the melodic what's there? Yeah and that's usually crazy they do it is here in July. It's not too tricky to find and then not one or is usually a ladder? What's down it? And the standard grades that I'm talking about will lead to a network of steam tunnels, which aren't usually accessible directly from the street. They'll just lead to a little hot room with a hundred more locked doors at the bottom usually locked. Have you seen the movie The Matrix Paintings? Yes, I have. I saw it if you felt a special relationship to that movie in some way that that notion up. of all of you are seeing this thing as a fund of you but this is an entire world behind the screen. Yeah, I definitely, I'm very strong. It really is  that because most people have no idea the extent to which they are being coddled and taking care of the millions and millions of dollars and men are still going. to all the support systems that sustain them and make it possible for them to live in an environment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think the rest of us are missing something interesting? And important, by not seeing this. What? Yeah. I really do think so. I think good. Yeah. the super part of the city is generally not more interesting than me. The open to the public part. If  what's going on under the streets, , there are another four levels of city underneath the one that you're walking on. And it really adds a lot here. Understanding the world you live in. Is there a four levels underneath the street level? Oh well, that would cross. applied to Toronto where there would be eating tunnels, ass lines, subway tunnels, and stormwater grains. And Chicago would probably be six levels in New York, but it probably here, it could doesn't kind of think. Is it the thing that's the most interesting thing about this secret world? The fact that it is secret? If it were open for two hours it would not be. that interesting. There's a true that your devotion to exploring around is so, is a fear of that sometimes you'll be on a date and you'll see a doorway or whatever abandoned the date. That's not uncommon for Instagram or to ask someone I'm out with to come with me or wait somewhere for me for 10 minutes. I mean sometimes when you see a certain door that's open in a certain way,  that you'd be missing a huge opportunity if you didn't take that. Tell me about the most recent time when that's happened. That happened. I'm not something to have to go. I was just walking through a subway station and happened to be strong. down a main hallway in the station and notice it was a cornering eye that hopped down a hallway a little bit. There was a door open with some unpainted cement behind which is usually a revealing sign that someone has accidentally left a door open. So I said to the person I said, we come check that out with me and she said no. So I said, okay, well I'm just awake here for minutes and I went through the door the door sounds a tiny little cradle of it or took that down few levels wound up in a mechanical room. Saw what it had to offer. I found I couldn't go back out the same way that I came in so I had to exit out to the street and paint my fairer and come back into the subway station again and move out. So I'm looking to take more than ten minutes. It may have taken a little longer than ten minutes. So when you're gonna grab with somebody, it's your motto kind of bring a book. Yeah, well the kind people I go with which I'm moving on to the music. I think overcoming your own mental block against going somewhere you're not supposed to go as usual for the district. People seem to just have this instinct to stay. on past make sure they only go places they've been clearly told they're allowed to go. They don't need to be told not to go. They actually specifically need to be told that they can and place for their world. I've gone to comparison before that fish farmers, they use these special underwater tanks vid. low little tiny oxygen bubbles, tubes, and the fish see a wall of oxygen bubbles so they don't swim through that wall. The idea is that fish will perceive that there's a solid wall there, and therefore they'll all stay put. And I think that's the exact same reason why people stay and can find two, the designated public areas of street level. and fully exploring their environment. They perceive walls that aren't there. Publisher of Infiltration, the scene about going places you're not supposed to go. Their website has the easy to remember name www.insultration.org. At four, look up in the sky. For astrophysicists have come to believe that the universe is made up more of things that we cannot see, dark matter of some particles, and things we can see. And one way to describe the process of science is that it chases after enames what is invisible to us. Nancy Updike invites you to consider the case of one subatomic particle, the neutrino. What you are sitting there right now, not... feeling yourself experiencing is the passage through your body every second of hundreds of neutrinos. There's so small that two a new trino, your body is mostly the empty space between the atoms, space for it to move through at the speed of light. Now neutrinos are able to do this because they have no electric charge and practically no weight. There are about 10 million times lighter than the smallest atomic particle. No one is ever seen one. The most abundant natural source of neutrinos in this corner of the galaxy is the Sun, which releases neutrinos during nuclear reactions in its core. These neutrinos travel through space unchanged without stopping forever. And since they're unchanged, they're one of the few ways we have to figure out exactly what's going on at the Sun's core. So here's the equipment we use to use to try to confirm the existence of these delicate elusive particles. A solid rock chamber dug into a gold mine in South Dakota, a metal tank, the size of the small ranch house, and inside the tank, 100,000 gallons of dry cleaning. Yes, dry cleaning fluid, because it's cheap and because it contains. Corey. Ray Davis is the chemist who designed this experiment, which is called HomeStake. He's been studying solo neutrinos for 30 years. The more liquid you have, the bigger the thing is, the more you capture in the tank. It just increases the likelihood. Yeah. Because you have to, you have to, account for the fact that most neutrinos are just going to keep going and are not going to stop. Yeah. Most of the interact are all in this stuff. That's the most important thing. I have liquid cold things throughout the mind, the other way and the other too bad. That's the way neutrinos are. Here's how it works. The chlorine and dry cleaning fluid when it's bombarded with neutrinos produces atoms of a radioactive gas called Argon 37. And when you count up the Argon 37 atoms, you've collected in the tank,  that for each argon atom, one new Treno passed through the tank. I know all of this because I've been obsessed with neutrinos ever since I first talked to Ray four years ago and I have to tell you that I'm here as an advocate, a fan. I don't just want you to understand neutrinos. I want you to love them. Consider their… history. New trainers weren't discovered so much as imagined, as a bizarre answer to an especially thorny problem. In the early part of the century, scientists thought they understood pretty well the basic workings of the atom, but when they measured the amount of energy atoms gave off during radio acted decay, the numbers didn't come out right. Now they could have concluded that perhaps our understanding of the atom was wrong, but they didn't. They came up with something that, to an unscientist, seems a lot crazier. The firstborn term Again, powerly suggested that maybe something comes out you can't see. Wolfgang Palli was exactly the sort of scientist who could say something that with a straight face. Hey, maybe what's happening here is that a particle is coming out that we can't see. A special secret invisible particle. Since Palli was smarter than almost everyone else, nobody told him he was nuts. In fact, other scientists took his idea very seriously. And Fermi! This is a... reconfirming scientists. For me, he developed a theory that would take this into account and he called it the neutrino. The little neutral one, he said the particle is neutral and it should have be almost impossible to detect. And for many years, that was a real problem. This was the... problem that Ray Davis started with as a young chemist at the World War II. He wanted to detect neutrinos. Since the lab where he worked had a nuclear reactor on site, and since neutrinos are continually emitted during nuclear reactions, he decided to start there, with, of course, some dry things fluid, in a relatively small container, a 55 gallon drop. It didn't work. You have to have a more sensitive detector. have to go underground. Underground, so that the Earth would shield the experiment from other particles from space to kept confusing raise results. That's began raised seemingly counter-intuitive plan to pursue one of the universe's most minestule ethereal particles by building bigger and bigger containers and moving them further and further underground until finally he was building 100,000 gallon tank, a mile underground. I'm Cheresen Pictures Through these Yeah, let's see. Oh, that's the take. That's the take. It's  a huge vitamin caps. Yes, it's a... The... The engineers call that a horizontal blue. And it's the take that's about 50 feet long and 20 feet diameter. And these are the posts that... There's a man standing there. One of the great things about Homestead is that it was almost written off as a complete flop, but over time it proved itself right and changed forever the way we looked at the sun. Basically Homestead challenged decades of accepted stellar evolution theory. Ray was supposed to register 10 nutrients a day in his day. That number was based on. care from calculations, using everything scientists already knew about nuclear processes. Instead, Racer only two neutriners a day, and his results never changed significantly. And no one could explain the problem with the neutriners, other than to tell Ray, his experiment just wasn't working. It wasn't until other neutriners' detectors started being built in the 1980s, that Racer's results were confirmed once and for all, and scientists finally began to face the mess that neutriners was. There's the science of things you can see in touch, surgeon studying hard, Diane Fossi out there with the gorillas, and there's the science of things you can't see. When race started his neutrino experiments, the director of his lab tried to warn him off, he only liked science who could see. A guy that works on things that are in the laboratory, hands on, and do this, you can't know where he is down. When you get up to the middle of the sun, you can't have a deep water. It's the best you can! I'm on the other side of the garden from Ray's farm and moss. I'm all for it in this building. I think it imposes humility, and that's a good thing. No one has ever seen a neutrino. No scientist, no thing. In the face of neutrino. we are all fumbling around in the middle of the sun doing the best we can. What we can't see rules us. Love and God, neutrinos, radio. But I think we want to be old. We want God to be ineffable. We want love to mysteriously endure after our physical presence is gone. We want to know that neutrinos are moving through us and continuing on unchanged forever. Everything we can see. is an explanation and an end and we don't want everything to end. Nesia, thank you.
