WBE is easy Chicago. It's mouth noise. Am I right glass? It's small moment. I'm WBE's Ishikago. Documenting every little thing in this are American lives. Hello, and WBE's Ishikago. You're listening to Chinwag Theatre. It was when I decided the name of our radio show Should no younger be your radio cry house and they which I kind of loved but Many people felt many people hated. I'll just say many people hated that title Especially public radio program directors Who told me that they already had radio drama? It's my no, no, we don't this isn't a radio drama show. It's cry house   TV Herman by house  TV Herman. It's a play house place with play, but it's also a stage It was when I decided the name the show should be American whatever. That everyone who I worked with decided not only was I raw, but I was longing a profound way that It indicated that we could never be friends. We could never truly understand or know each other. I was wrong in a way that was incomprehensible to people who I worked with every day. I was wrong in a way that was incomprehensible to people who I worked with every day. I am  your however to talk about myself and our good old relationship because I believe that we accidentally stumbled onto a broader, more fundamental truth about naming something. Naming of business, a restaurant, a person, a dog. Well not a dog, because  people don't care what you name your dog. It's true of naming everything except for naming a dog. People are unbelievably tolerant at naming a dog. You could name your dog. You were made your pie house. and nobody would think twice about it. And I would send your free coffee mug or something just for proving you right. What I learned is that there's something about a name. , most of the creative acts that one does in one's life. There's enough content to them. They are longer than the length of a name. And so when people disagree with each other, they can discuss it. There's, there's pros and cons. They're a part of it that you can dissect. But then... mean is so basic so it's so and and Divideable Even if it's got a lot of words in it That that all you get is this visceral very binary response it Don't  it Well from WBE's Chicago this is class works So we need German you see can actually, the BBE, Zichita go, glass nose. That's the, that's the most horrifying possibilities that you're going to be using your own name. Well, we did settle on a new name. And by the way, we were very unusual show tonight, many unusual things coming up. In Act 3, David Isaacson with the beginning of this new project where we're having various great unusual writers and performers give their take on our presidential campaigns. And Act 2, I don't even want to go into it. Just stay with us here because... shows she could change a lot. Anyway, we did settle on a new name and to discuss the name and all the different names that led to the name. The pre-names, the discarded names, the oh, get it. To discuss that I called one of the grand old men of broadcasting. He's had the longest running talk show in the history of television. It's New York. Well, do you have Franklin? Yep. It's ever glass at the Riddish Ocean. kind of right our home up was it What kind of right they give me let me give me 15 minutes Yes, I wrote what kind of business are you doing there? Oh, I write so lots of walls And they're black God be balls, I mean, what's the eyed list? I see And I got to go through that I got to go through it. So what do you think of changing name, huh? Yeah, in fact we've announced a name change and you were on our first program Give me advice about having a program which does longevity. Yeah, yeah, we take that in my office here. We did it over the phone. Right. So you were just sitting in your office and talking to me. I remember that. And so we thought we'd have you back just to review some of these names. Mm-hmm. I'm ready. Okay, so let me read a couple of these titles by American whatever. American whatever? Yeah. And big, big, big. I request in his radio cowboys. Well, if you want to make a play on your name, what does he say? I would call it the house of glass. I can't believe you saying that what it would be, what it be, what it be a hotel in the cascades. , , roasting, or a concoeur, or browns, or a bungalow colony, or what you call a cochalane. But I would definitely, I would definitely, , call it the one that's wearing the house of glass. There was a whole, actually, there were many suggestions, especially for my Los Angeles. They were very strong in the idea of going. glass house is a title. Glass house here. Yeah. House of glass little more airy. Dye. Little more formal. , what that's up to you. Other names that were suggested glass nose, which means openness. , is we're doing new stop. Hmm. Glass, managerie. Right. Splendor in the glass. Hmm. You don't see the glass, man. He got the glass glass. Glass. No, that was a good one. Okay, other titles. Radio wishes. vicious or vicious   delicious yes or two-cusing two-cusing a million stories better than the preceding one yeah but not so much race how about this title this American life I was saying that's about the best yet better the radio playhouse anyhow I'm glad you said this because that's actually going on in charge. Yeah, yeah, yeah That's it all So I think anything weird not dark for America's at was where the miracle was for it? No, it's the second one. When did they with the miracle? It was the beginning, they did the beginning. It's always near the beginning. Always, yeah. How important is the name? I would say the name, certainly. Look at the maritalist Mongrot. Or Mongrot told me that you've got a name. I have a foul sound. Eight. Eight. I hope. Now, what's that again? What was your type again? The American Sittigan. This American life. Yes, he got the, he's got one, he got one. sound i, right, right. So it's a good name is everything. Wait, there's an i in this. No, but not, but not the year, not the a i, oh, oh, no, gotta be this soft, this soft, this soft, I gotta be a hard i, ,  the word I  the now i. what I mean? It's gotta be a sound of a, e i, oh, or u. So wait, so what's a good title under this criteria? Well, though, this American life, we, is an end, it end. on a vowel sound, it's in a vowel. Does the Joe Frank and Show conform to this rule? Well, Joe, we're Joe. Oh, I see, he's a long vowel. Joe and Show, yeah. So, my Joe, wait, Joe, knows the English. So, you've always got the eights. I, oh, we're all sound. Do they need anything? A name  John Smith. Got no, no, Mark, vowel sound. So, I've got that appealing. So, it's viral to vowels sounds. TV Touching, let's Joe Frank. one. He has a book out, he has no statics. Everywhere. I believe they'll help you mess up And then I knew they'd learn what happened to them Because they asked me how much I had in the band These had to think long term investments And then all the others had were given themselves These said the net before I would just And they'd tell us about the man that they lied You said the record would happen to me And they were never seen the car in this time You were the man on something and I said I got and another hot wall that killed your lover That's in my desk, I'm a girl, you meant you didn't let them ever give it to themselves Because the next week we were all at just two five That girl has a massive metal glass Hey Mr. Keele, touch me, shall we add a deal? I'm not you, say, you scratched my back and I scratched you again And I touch you, shall we add a deal? Well I told you about the world of stress, I wonder when you've been a criminal the rapid times of thinking, just be safe stationers can't wear it Because they have a lot of time on the air, nothing they wanna be in again And the district here's without a time, the district got us as She sent me big likes to maintain this movement And then all the others have been given the child So the net we want to just do fine The class I'm a cementer the life And if you bring it up, that's you should be out of tune I'm not cheap, I said you should ask my back in I should ask you to be out of tune And then I just said we had a tune Happycraft encouraging you onhhh Happycraft station Open one. Pure pressure. But last week on this program, it has one of our stories about the state of the nation's economy. We did a report about Chicago's Navy Pier, what it costs taxpayers and what they got out of it. It costs, if you do not hear our show, $155 million taxpayers money and created at most $1200. How about half of those part-time? That's $130,000 per job. Spokesman for the city said that we should judge the Pier by the pleasure that it gives Chicagoans and the overall boost that it gives to tourists. not by the cost per job created. But in our report, we also took pains to point out that by all accounts, the peer has been a huge, huge business success. Prouds are twice as big as anyone projected of her three million people for six months. The stores and restaurants on the peer said they're doing well by one. But two days after our broadcast, the news broke that Navy Peer is in fact losing money, at least the city agency that runs the peer is, and losing a lot of money. $9 million. Peer's first eat money. of business. Those of this Navy peers announced that it will lay off one fourth of its full-time staff to do other costs cutting. We have put in several requests over the course of this week to speak with the head of the peer, James Ryle, or another peer spokesperson. We wanted to ask what was going wrong. How could they be doing such gangbuster business in Stogluz money? With over 3 million visitors, cities using two to three dollars per visitor, and this applies to charges. $16. All this week, the public relations office, it may be pure, has promised an interview, but in the end this did not happen. Of course, as we can get defining out why the peer is losing all this money, is in Crain's Chicago business. There, the head of the peer authority in the survey light. So the losses had to do with opening delays on what paper called first year inefficiencies. It did not go into details. And we have one other amendment, last week's story on Navy Pier. When they came into work after the story aired, one of my fellow staffers, the rich Cognos Public Radio Station, his parent Freeman. Tell me then in our coverage about the economics of Navy Pier, we had missed the main point of what makes the pier so worthwhile to Chicago taxpayers. And at the end of the work day, he loaded his two twin girls into their special, wide load double-stroller. The radio station is located midway down Navy Pier, and we headed out into the common night. show me what he's talking about. If you're parent for families, this place is just  the best place in the city Chicago, the Brinkley Brinkley Kids. Because no matter what, when you come down here, what time are they, your children will be amused. So how often you bring your kids here? They come here at least twice a week. I mean, I, ,  I worked out here, so I bring it down here, at least a week. But I tell you, , a lot of times, if I can't think of anything else to do, we come down here. And they just run around. They run around for the story to story. It's all called or flu. Look, they're four. So it's colorful. There's dolls, they're walking with fun colors, and now they got the big, , they love the army Max hit the big, , they had to, , they had to, they got to make 3D army Max, we had to see the hit with this book source, you can go on  children museum shop, even with the children museum is closed, the children museum gift shop, you can spend, you kill off half an hour 45 minutes just looking at the stuff in there. We headed to the atrium at the center of the pier, Aaron kept one hand on his stroller and threw the other in a broad sweep of the panoramic. You look around and there's nothing but great stuff. Shibu's Museum. We are the Mekdownals. If you're a kid, you can't pop this. I mean, there's toy stores. What is if you're a disillmate, you're a foyer, you look around. Is this not just a feast? If you're four, just think back. It would be fun. Sure. Okay. You want to have this? Say it  this. Because the parents, you're parents. They are happy here. And this went this stuff for parents. Do you want to use them? You can go. You can go drink. He's not up with us. Oh, these are twentling the new. We headed up to the Crystal Gardens, where inside of the glassed environment, there are palm trees, jumping waters, literally streams of water which spurred out and jump on one artificial pond to another. As Aaron expanded on how wonderful this was, and she noted for the record that his two small children were not particularly jittered. It was the end of the day. They were tired and up- the way that even $155 million of taxpayers money cannot alter or change. It's politicians  Sadie's days. There are some problems that go through your can't solve and about how much money it throws at them. Now you're in a slept, this was cranky, jumping pounds are not. I'm coming. You don't want to come. I'm coming. You don't want to be here. Where do you want to be? I'm coming. Sounds good. So we headed downstairs. Let me catch the food. the boy, Artemis perpapidate. We have to get further death. Yes, we have to get food. We're gonna feel it. Do you want to have some pizza? I'm gonna give you an old sandwich. What are you gonna give? I thought you wanted pizza. I'm gonna give. Oh, man. Old meal. Turns out, oatmeal is not gonna be fine, dining options. Have to make sure you're food court. Artemis hopped out of the strawberry and headed over to Connie's pizza. Oh, you're a little bit old. You're an old meal. I'm saying. Do you want to go here? I don't know. I'll be here. Come on. in order to pizza for the kids and while we waited two minutes at a text cut, this other got it Diana made a little announcement. I need a show do something. What did you do to show me? Well I gotta get food too though okay? What do you want to show me? What's really cool? What show we have to get food okay? Around this it was pretty empty, no special events, places in here. But there were other families, kids ran around. It was with us. Diana and Artem escaped to her gotten to her tiny spatter tube that played smart. When the food arrived, Aaron had them due to regular family ritual, plus to him. That was the crust made out of bread. I'm how most it. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. I love the sun. Well, I'm not seeing what's happening how are we? Oh, me. What's the word there, Ness? Have a place  this for panelists in the city. How do you want this city to spend taxpayers money? After the eight, another family which will, the kids run each piece of trash to the garbage in one piece of a time. Are you getting fun? No, no. Here you go. See, we know it's about the 20 feet, 25 feet over the entrance. Now you see there's a close trash can. What they , run it! They  the y'all! They haven't learned about this conservation energy thinking. No! No! No! No! No! By the time you put some in the car, Aaron says, but the exhaust is ready to go to sleep down for the night. What parents are going to complain about that? After the trash is thrown away, Aaron wants to buy the ice cream, but they and they remember there's one day a vintage business. And then we, you guys, we go with me to see this at home. What is this surprise? If I told you I might be as surprised so we... So we gather our things and we followed Diana to the surprise. We had passed the court through the McDonald's, just a special space-aged court. Lots of plates and colors. Lots of all these things are not as surprised as it was. We're not there. I guess it's where. Where do I see it? It was here so weird. It was here so weird. Diana runs in that rapid water, very small children have when they run. Through the McDonald's, unable to find her original surprise when suddenly she hears music coming from the hall and water runs 40 points. Oh no! I'm perri- that's the product I'm looking for! Yeah! It's not a parade, but pure pressure, or jazz musicians hired by the fear, playing in an otherwise empty beach. She stands in pointing at the band excitedly, turning to go a couple of days, turning back to the band. It's tempting to call this a price list, but of course we know the price. One of you 55 million dollars, plus the 12, that Aaron spending a food treat, plus part. Girls' listen happily didn't use it for a while, and then head out for a price. Alright. Ready? Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! My mind is blown! This morning baby! And I'll buy you in a bag! My mind is blown! This morning baby! And all my you in it play You won't I say that sound And make a list of your needs You ain't driving talking I've been just dying I won't free I'm not alone This morning baby And all my you in it play You won't Now I can all make a Call and use the make your mouth ripped.

And I'll buy you and it's late enough. I'm gonna kill the girl Luke Dẩnst rip-Nough please. I'm not that real sports car that we saw the other day. Oh man I'm just kidding. Bring it down and why don't we? Why do you need everything? The hand truth, but when you love birds low, money makes some sunshine through my money's low. This is going baby, and I'll buy you anything. Act 2, Band-Ans. You probably already seen the footage. This is the court that Granny ugly lighting the court room's have on today. This judge. This is a visual assertion of disabled-looking men and women in suits who do the business of our courtrooms, lawyers, jurors, crass the audience. Now, come on, a woman in a star trekking farm. This was white water trial and the woman in the uniform was on the jury, Barbara Adams to name. She has since been removed from the jury. People have snickered, all across the country. One of the most interesting discussions of this drawer, and of what we are to make of her, Colonel the Internet, was something called a listserv group, this one about Panda. This is fandom as in fans of TV shows, especially science fiction shows, Babylon 5, Star Trek. That kind of thing. This group is devoted to the academic study of what it means to be a fan. And on editor fans and academics who post messages to each other. And the discussion kicked up with one woman. who wrote in in disbelief . I only saw a brief bit of it on CNN, but in the media it made me want to go and hide somewhere. There was footage of the drawer in STTNG uniform, Star Trek, the next generation. Capoeit with Faser and a sort of gear I believe, and upon seeing the Bank of News cameras, just drawer gave them the Vulcan salute. Am I getting this correctly? Can anybody fill in some of the blinds? Am I wrong for being embarrassed for Trek fandom in general? I mean, as far as providing it. that just to go image for vast tracks of cable watching America of the fan as crazed, detached from reality, unitec nerd that pictures some forth about sports. Anybody else even see this? Or I've ever been breathing too many photocopy games to have. But something interesting is her horror. she was horrified in the way that you're horrified when you see a member of your own family. Do something strange in the background. public. Other people wrote in a mirror short heard that yes this was real. There's one. Woman did comfortably dress with phaser as an alternate juror for a state of the picture showed her as a curiosity. And a day or two later however the journalist could not resist asking her what it was all about. She said very politely that she was the commander of a local starship. A Star Trek group in Wooder Rock that she wore her uniformed all form locations to remind the general public of the meaning of Star Trek. I think the reporters are probably laughing at first, but then the last start of Goli Red said that she was an excellent chore, very serious, to copious notes. The reason she was dismissed was that the reporters asked her outside the courthouse about the uniform, and although there was a gag order on the trial, she thought it was okay to talk since start strike had nothing to do with the trial. She only gave him a short collider, so she said that he'd go along. The judge says that she violated the gag order at the smister. The article seemed to indicate that she got a bomb deal. I had mixed feelings. reading about it. I once had a student in a group calm class I was teaching do the exact same thing. Every class showed it in this new form. At first people sniggled, but he was very polite. He was uniform-gamed in self-confidence. Eventually everyone in class accepted it. As much as they accepted African-American and religious symbols. And they even used him as an ex-girl on a mock group exercise. They had to figure out who class asked how to equip a spaceship for a long journey. People started to lay in saying that no, they should not be embarrassed at all. They start to make mistakes. One wrote, in Paris for Trek fandom, I was proud of the uniform-clad white water would be Jorab. She said, showy's words are uniform to formal events. Frankly, I'd rather be associated with trackers than with the governor of Arkansas, or any other garbage that apparently goes down in Little Rock. Jorab looked a lot less stupid than two thirds of the past than present Clinton administration. Henry Jenkins posted a note to the group. He is the director of film and media studies at MIT, and after two books about fandom, the guy who says called science fiction audiences, watching Star Trek and Dr. Poo. He says it is someone who's been a fan for 20 years, who's often thought there are strong analogies between the way that gaze and lesbian still these kinds of issues. The way the fan community does. He talked about politics of cultural practice, people who feel strong, attachment to certain things in the culture. He's been... similar to the politics of sexual preference. We asked him if he'd go into a radio studio in Boston and read some of his posting for us and disgrace us enough to read. I've often thought there were strong analogies to be gone between the queer communities politics of sexual preference and the family communities politics of cultural preference. From the point of view of mundane culture, both groups provoke discomfort concerning their stainless taste and shocking behavior. What often hears people speak of coming out? or being closeted work. Fans often hide their cultural preferences, afraid of what their office mates might think about their hobbies, their friends, their creative accomplishments, or how they spend their weekends. I've known many fans who've had the hide fanzines from unsumptuous adults, or lighted their spouses that are going to be convention. And most of us have been snickered at, and subjected to endless irangs in the popular media. We have our own terminology with the sputes, rejecting the outsider term tracking, and to stop. organized to move, the insider term trucker with its positive connotations of acting for suspicion. That's why many of us automatic encranged when we saw pictures of the whiteboarder juror and are starkly hearing from them. But in his posting on the internet, Jenkins wrote that he thought this position and thought about his analogy to queer politics. Yeah, it seems to me that an awful lot of what we do in the fan community has strong furloughs from some of the debates in the curer in the community surrounding the gaze of the There's a debate going on there right now that's often labeled placing table to big because it grows out of Bruce Bauer's book or placing table. The central issue is when gay community, , on the one hand, Bauer is arguing that gay should assimilate, they should sort of downplay transgressive behaviors that they should mainstream themselves. They should mainstream themselves. Right, and I hear a lot of other people. They shouldn't be reading around and dragging or in leather or on gay pride parade. They should try to fit in and then it might... in acceptance level. The problem of course is that that pushes the queer community into doing a dirty work or the family values first. You seek acceptance by policing your own ranks and by saying what's normal and what's not. And the argument goes that one's only free is a community when the most extreme behavior is allowed to express itself. And I think if we read the fans behavior by those standards, that is, , it adds an expression of her cultural preferences. Then we have to defend her right to where the uniform and respect the courage and confronting the public ridicule. So, around the direction. For choice, kind of represents a new kind of fan identity politics, if you were hired to be entalled by William Schatner and others to get a life, or tired of being stereotyped as living in her parents' basement. In fact, we are a wide variety of people who happen to believe in the cultural power of television and of all our, the change the way we think about the universe. So what's exciting about the fan? behaviors and she wasn't afraid, she didn't hide, she asserted very publicly who she wasn't and what her commitments were and I see it as kind of striking a blow for the dignity of fans, particularly given how thoughtful modern and articulate she happened to be. Did you cringe a little bit on your side? I first saw that I did but as I started to think through this issue, I started to think, , why am I cringe? Why am I ashamed? I've written two books on stare-track and culture . I have a very strong commitment to the idea. that it is one of the participatory cultures of our time. One way people have a talking back to fellow people, of taking control of their own lives and creating their own culture for materials they borrow from the mass media. So I shouldn't be ashamed in fact to see it projected even in the most public and political of spaces. What this wouldn't be of them. Well, I think, well, increasingly, it means what it is to be an American from the digital age that is if we look at who are the positives get ourselves concerned in the future. 3% of the American public considered themselves to be stir-track paintings. That means that all of those are not people who were reprised by these and are only tightened to war uniforms. That they are people who represent the full range of American wine. And as we began to move online, as society, it seems abundantly clear that television fandom becomes a central motivation that gets people to stay in the digital realm. That is, what are we going to talk about when we go online and have the possibility to talk to people from around. comes to you in a round the world. We're not going to talk about my anagative you and the people in Chicago. If never heard of you. We're going to talk about people and images and stories that sharing common. And those images and all likelihood are going to come from national or even internationally circulated shows  Sturterac. So the point is that national media provides the family community with a way of telling its own stories, a framing its own identities, which allows the speak to each other. Across all kinds of isolation, we face this society. And we Jenkins is directly. to a film and media studies at MIT, to spoke with us with it, you are in Boston. And we close our virtual visit in the one-by-sweetie of the Internet Post . Now, the most interesting aspect of the story is not that she wore her uniform in court, but that she got selected despite or perhaps even because she wore the uniform. Jerry's election on a high profile case  Whiteboard has become an increasingly exact science. Experts make recommendations to lawyers based on the body of stereotypes. And how different social groups are likely to respond in certain kinds of faces or arguments. Blacks are good for the defense, white men are good for the prosecution and so forth. But they're probably never needed to be a grid for fans as a social group anymore. So what stereotypes are fans of the experts draw upon and assessing this particular juror? When I first saw our picture in the paper, she was awaiting jury selection. My immediate response would be that she'd never be pit. Neither the prosecution nor the defense would find work. except because as a trucker, she would be seen as two aberrants, two unpredictable, two abnormal and excessive. Instead, I suspect a different stereotype I've put in this. The notion that fans are gullible, easily led, easily manipulate. Both sets of warriors probably thought that they could control her with their rhetoric. After all, if she can't tell the difference between TV, she'll be alive, she's pushed over for whatever arguments they want to commit. The one we saw interviewed on television news, Helen. If it's neither scary thought. She was thoughtful, moderate, and articulate. She also happens to be a stir-track fan. Get used to him. The whole case is as Mr. Spock would say, fascinating. We're all rocking for a day to the moon, any old town we do so. Get rid of him and head down in your hair. We're talking to the viewers, the lack of all. But we move on to another kind of fandom. Music Music It is as american-my guitar shows. Connect to it. So let's say it's not Star Trek, Chib Shredenvi. Let's say it's Kiajo. When Cindy Patton is married, I have a lot of hinting around to her family. She was given a GI Jo for Christmas. The next recollection of incredibly detailed matchbox cars was her favorite toy. But after three idyllic years of GI Jo, Mother started to get worried about certain tendencies she was noticing in Sydney. And a Christmas, Cindy only got clothes. When we dressed up in the back of my mother and my sister, It had burdens on a shop on earth, but only the look of the wood has been brought to a witnesses consideration. One was suspicious because her son was 1930, likely not sure whether she wasї and rode around herself. Just now, I don't know, I sniffed that stuff from the other side. But as you can smell my smell, you should be peeking over her pieces. After L1 point looked at me and my mother said in this town that now seems I can just sort of hear it. This year we're going to make you into a little lady. But my response to the time I was a very kind of calculating little child. I was once at the time I was I can help last this and I figured  about six more years and I would be off to college and then I could do whatever I wanted. in college, Cindy came out of Skay. Now she's a professor at Temple University, right so a lot about gay issues. But at some point in her mid 20s, she became sort of obsessed with getting her favorite toys back from her parents. I describe it as sort of this question to get them back because my parents kept them for very ongoing pre-tests preventing me from taking these toys. Now I had taken a few other stuffed animals and things  that. So it wasn't  they were trying to prevent. and he from taking toys in general, but these particular toys seem to be unable to leave my parents home. I flew down at one point at that time. I think my mother said, oh, , the planes are really crowded and you can only take so many things on and so, , you can't take this. It was welcome visit you and bring them. Of course, when they came to visit, they had forgotten to bring them. This one went on for several years. And I finally sent this fairy, , no ifs engine. but sletter basically saying, send me my toys. My nephews were given various toys of mom to play with, and they were not very careful and so I'd become kind of alarmed and I felt sort of intruded apart and betrayed in some way by having these toys of mom and given to my nephews. And they're also of course under the guy so  your sisters and have very much money you have. of this toy, Stem has really used. But I think it was also about, or at least in mind, in any way, there was something about the toys finding their way into the appropriate gender scene. It's that somehow, as a girl child that I have not used these toys in the public way or something, to take things in the wrong about my relationship. There would be recuperate, and by them having boy children, , in music. To play. At some point, Cindy Pat noticed how urgently she wanted those toys back for her parents. She started to remember things about the toys that she had forgotten, how she'd cared for them, meticulously. Those returning GI-Jodd was boxed, playing with them. Keep in track, every accessory, every instruction she. matchbox cars were  me, after years playing for the doors still work. Steering wheels still turn. I think in a way, don't I keep calling it a success? It's less about some sort of obsessive, compulsive desire than it is about a kind of ritual of preservation. And I think that I had that. I wonder whether when I was a kid, I realized that I wasn't going to get away with this. , this is not really being a girl. And so that I was very, very, very careful to, , keep very, very good care of this particular story. So I mean, in general, it took a good care of me, but I was especially detailed and kind of, it was almost  a kind of meditation. The toys themselves, in this particular obsession I had for retrieving them from a normal, really made me recognized complexity of my own. gender structure and probably gender structures in general. What she realized was that she wanted this part of her past that was boy, where she was  a boy. And the reason why this was such a revelation was that she was of the generation of lesbians who came with age in the 1970s. The so-called lesbian feminist wanted to do a way with the old lesbian order in which some of them were more of a bunch, more  man, and some were found, more  women. The way to move towards it, new show. sort of non-gender. This idea is actually a fashion now among younger recipients, which and fam are back and back with the vengeance. But seeing well then, how much she wanted GI Joe for old GI Joe and her matchbox cars was what made Cindy Pat and Rune Eyes. She thought that she wasn't this kind of neutral non-gender person. She realized that she thought of herself more as a boy. Final package came. I couldn't believe it, I was quite... my heart was beating. I think I was driving to work or something , sort of picking up with the person on the way. And I think I might have waited until lunch and then gone back out with a car and kind of, , suraptitiously open the package and found these things. But I was quite moved. It was very... Yeah. , we sort of , recovering a piece of my child with my childhood as a boy. This is good hope. Call your little dance copy on the floor. I am drunk, keep paying. Never you go. Call your wife. Sleep in summer nabin. If you go you break my heart. Just, I never got it. We could butt. For every hour in the day. You got to do it. and we say we want you. These come on from the truth.

We have non-journalists, cover aspects of the presidential campaign, commission original work from these non-journalists. We begin with Chicago Claywright David Askson who's done many plays here in Chicago with the theater we've left prepared this about how you can. I have a question last name, which is an odd thing in and of itself because I am not prone to dreaming especially lately. Zaw stayed after very full. days campaigning gales for the Oryus' self-sidesh Tagot. Why don't I dream at night? Well hair, Sigis Moot Freud, and his cabal of Austria-Ithus mind-backers, say that dreams are the not-turned expressions of all that is impressed during the day. But the thing is, I don't repress. If it pops into my head, I let it pop right out of my mouth. That's the source of my pop popularity. While the Clinton's and Dolls check the contingencies. and polls for every public utterance. I'm utterly straight with my public. I don't press, so I don't dream. Sit last night. It was the hardest thing. I dreamt of myself, but myself in the past and in the present and in the future. The first part, it was very green. Being grass everywhere. Being grass and swapping some fur. up in the spline overhead, Jew it's leaned against dome and spashing weeds, misto. I stood in front of an enormous electrified chain length fence that went on and on, disappearing into the cloud field horizon spoke north and south. Apparently I was the order guard in ancient Celtic Iriolene. And low, who should appear on the other side of this massive barbed wire perhience hill of heritage seek saffered, Same Patrick! I cried out. Well this is a fire at how do you do? they were just going meet your parade each time of the other day, kissing and then all same Patrick's lovely. I have come to be the bishop of your land. Well I don't know sing, I replied, where were you born? Vittin! Invitt! Oh no, well Mr. Ruh, Vitt, we got laws, passed to show ordinance, preventingzych aliens. yourself, your safety from becoming citizens or getting any of King McNeil's handouts to the passenger. You see, we got too many foreigners coming in, taking our jobs, co-y jobs  that bishop for your angular force. You don't understand. I was named, ordained by Saint-German-Sincen, to lead the Irish people. Oh, now, well, that's the problem. We don't want the German. This is telling us what to do. German is generally the reason for being flagged, breaking our soldiers in some possible sigh. world away. We built up the factories and infrastructures of the Germanist's, have Yana Hoto's and now what do we look at? Two hundred million dollar trade deficit. You don't understand. I'd ring with me the Latin Bible. Ah, that's not gonna win your points. Gaelix, the official language of this country, sir, calls the Tu-Chan-L-A-Man-Lip. I'd ring the shamra-plover whose three leaves represent the izada-uli-finity. We don't want trial, lateralism here, seniorer, say. You're talking new world or I am a world, world bank, golden and sats with their sats gold. This here is a sub-relation under God. But to this God who is sent me here, the platform for us that patched my dream, to chase the snakes from your land. Oh, no! I've applied. Chase the snakes, haven't stood up yet. If you've managed the snakes, they'll just show up and repressed forms in our dreams. Right here is one crawling. of my leg now. And if this part just when my fat has it was threatening to become a goofy, meta-tree, the action suddenly shifted in that crazy way, tweens go, shifted to the present, when I heard the strain supply to hand-pained heat-solve. But you're a boy, make a big lie, strain in the street, gonna be a big mess, and you got my on your face, you big... There I was, sitting with my friends and advisors, Larry Pratt, Samuel Prance, and John Mop, and the Reverend Donald Wyallman. Talking about where my campaign should go from here. Which is funny that it was those guys in the team, who's those who are the ones that have gotten me into hot water with immediate, because, well, let's just say those fellows don't repress their beliefs. They talked some local militias about a war against the bad race. Go have fun! to take the industries made up of people raised Jewish homes, or about the Primisky with homosexuals literally held anti-Syctinism. Suicide? Well, they're just being cranked, which is a lot more than we can expect in bell-winged incitters  that parrot the lobster, or bill-printing chasing issues  a blind dog in a meat cart. Anyway, in the dream, we were talking about my options, the boys and I, the three paths, diverging in our red white and blue wood, to be the good party boy, I was in 1992. to sleep down  a beat to bomb the deer on San Diego and August with a wooking religious war cry against the murder of the unborn, or to go to the while asleep, while departed to make me a layman home. But this being the dream, things started to matter more fires, lofty and heads smith open in the head of my old boss Richard Nixon sprouted from the shoulders in a bloody bloom of scatological curses. Never leaves the ex-pulvift deleted part, Patti Cho. his jowels flat  sails in a sprawl. I stood by Ike. I stood by death. But I was distracted as mild as we friends burst from their own bodies  sagging gypsy moths from their crystalline. Becoming animatronic incarnations of my father's trio of heroes, general the character, Joe McCarthy, and Francis Thofanko. I can be Ike 52, but I gave him hell at the end. adventure. Franco, of course, was for his militant third party approach. Senator Joe was checking under my silver remains. The whole architecture of between France and Vietnam. I was in the future, about 2010, so touring college campuses and 90s nostalgia parks and some virtual entertainment calls for the League of Heaven. which was me, Pat Robertson, and Pat Boo. My buddy Robertson cited various popular and folk nails of so-and-devising, all of which about earthquakes, idle waves, and geolibwell democratic presidents, the bisexual vibes, states, and school volunteers, and India made the math lights, and she learned a bunch of trans-law activity in Antichrist. And Pat Boo. Glenvin, mayors Laming! This thing of virtual entertainment of the future, I'm not sure if Apple was alive or really a hologramist to hear you just kidding with the light in the Dio's rubber cement to the other side of my eyelids. But there he was, clean cut light nuts, singing a rendition of the Sight 5.6-car cover, I almost lost. my mind along with the smatter his selections for his fine dust blowbows. And then I came on, the main act, sounding all the beads out of the sounded this year camping, ishings on your tree bow. Thinking my father these odd work was able to provide for his family. Now, in  my father, if I know outlet for their hard work, their ideals, their faith going to be my circumstance. I told them how the Ruth Ginsberg's Vader Hose to keep leapsigging our fences and booting tagging our buildings with his Symbian-E's gang symbology. Tackling handouts and living off welfare of Yomi-Yom-Chao, giving birth the young fact cocked at taxpayer expense, sashimiing his way into our high-tech-amaki jobs, while our boys and the military have to strap on the helmet coal of the United Heaven Nations and fight for the Turkish delight of robbing hoods and radical sheets. As my futuristic audience, Chordle, picked up tradition into the biogenicly filter there of the campus mediatarium. I realized that I had become a parody in myself. Our act, three paths, was being presented with the same count intentions as when they were trotting out Timothy Leary and Gordon Littian mocked the gates a few years back. Now I am not a man who's grown to self doubt. I... am my own catacus. But maybe it's the meaning I've been taking lately, even from man who I consider to be my friends, Bill Buckley, Bill Sapphire, George Will. They make the doubts pile up and spill over into dreams. Heck, I'm the only one left in this camping with firm beliefs and true convictions. And yet I fear, I fear becoming some comic footnote in history and man struggle to lift his world up closer to the kingdom. My futuristic dream self-gamedly thundered on, but somehow the honest Christian faith of Greenham named Patrick had become the 21st century's equivalent of the Brady Lunch movie today, a farce, a way of feeling superior to our former and better selves. I think I woke up then I'm not sure. I'm willing to my third cup of coffee now and it's had time to board that bus and move all to the next crowd. the next state of the next primary. I suppose I should dwell on my dream a little more, analyzing, plum its debts. But I'll even interpretation to those ranks of young rakey and so twist every god fearing thought to prove that we're all homosexuals. The god is dead, that the race is teachings of Eldritch cleaver should be talking our schools while the songs of Jesus are there. See, I can't waste too much time on my own soul-served. I've got to get out there with my posth. Fat for the soul of America. Great great David Azks. Oh, that feels  home is farther left, though they're unsure. Landed here in Chile, and hand in. Devil of many more. He got a job then got a wife. Then a family. A very tired and left his old she'll leave his stick to me. So it's the same old she'll let me talk. I got from my alarm. And Devil of men was part of the easy walk with the dine's hand. He'd lead the band long, had his day and followed around his hips. And Devil a bit redlapped it through that foot to have a fit. So with the same old she'll let me part of the stick it doesn't mean. Slas just leave the down here on the way and knock him down again and then is the time he used it on me to make me understand. The same old shillily me father brought from Ireland. I am going on the police force, it's the only thing to do. Instead of having one night stick, we go, I have to. If there's a fight I will be all right, there's no one bothers me. Because I have the old shillily me father gave to me. You're the same old shillily me father brought from Ireland.
