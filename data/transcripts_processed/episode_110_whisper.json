So, this section we have, perhaps, we have the brushing, or we have a book, drum. Propheonthus looking at a cratered size for manhole cover, crossing the next. Yeah. So, that's where I end up with bubbles of that, , you have the brushing there. So what you do is to triangle the line in between them, another line and then to access the line between them. In the gate up, perhaps also the correct way. Nuneo Gwatt, if you trip on the sidewalk and hurt yourself, you cannot sue the city. As somebody had informed the city before him, there was a problem with the sidewalk. When we told the authorities to fix it, there wasn't any negligence. And so, years ago, a group of attorneys simply decided to hire a map public to go out each year and try every foot sidewalk in Nuneo. in the maps to the city which makes it possible for introducing your clues to do what nature apparently intends to them to do which is, here's the court. Well, under sheet I would also look to the crosswalk. It's not EV, so usually use some rectangles to guess that. And an usual top. Perhaps says that wherever it is, most of the side part. He's getting cornered. The wind is up at health foods, so there is a big sign that says juices and citrus, does what kind of juice should be. Go along with the juices. There is a ria, chen, tints, carobos, crop and moths from the whole of the water. That we have these crops here. It's going to name some of the things that you're not putting on the top. There's a perfume and gift shop. There's a natural foods place. There's the passport letters play. It's one of the curtains up this guy sitting on a great try to fix a gold plot. Not very well. No, no, this goes on the map. No, no, no, this is on the map. Nope. Nope. Nope. This gets to the very heart with map making so about. Creating a map means ignoring everything in the world but one thing. Substance if you find popping up an Things Sonny behind it. the house of Hollywood stars, work to be the cracks inside of the wall, mats have meaning because they thought throughout all the chaos, so successfully. One, and this is the age maps, they wait. Then this word is hyper-proof, while it's something  99.99% of all maps are made in the center. This century, the word. What are those maps? The purpose of course you have been doing good maps that most of us civilians use a use which is just a road map to this one place. But obviously you said that you've missed all the maps right off the past and you've got a road map because you've forgotten about the maps you see every night on television, maps of letters and newspapers. The weather maps, the maps of the magazines. Welcome to the EZ Chicago Public Radio International to smear in life from my request. Today on our program, Happy! Every map is the world seems with different lengths and today on our program we bring you five different stories five different ways looking at the world story about somebody who is a magic world using a different human sense at one site at two hearing at three smell and that I could pay a visit to Serenosa sciences electronic nose at four at two touch and I find that in the world in the case through us about this That one. Side. Ordinary people use impact. Putting to critheagofordms with bats a very recent development. But, until a few centuries ago, to an war, empire's sailed seas, all got maps. You do have some ancient maps that belong in them, simply used by authorities for taxes, that. Early maps relatively few, usually exist to a proper sunspecific. purpose. That is changed of course. Then it's with brought to the studio. Set of maps that he's been years. That's a zone named Curtin Ballenoid. They put foil on pipes. Then it's with begins with a regular vocator map showing how the streets of oil pipes fit within the streets of the surrounding city. And then there's a map of part of what would be seen if you were to look through the surface of the earth into the neighborhood. that we don't usually experience, but the sewer management, so forth and so on exposed, whatever they so it's a map of mammals, gas lines, water lines, the sewer lines. I'm looking at a map now that's got all of the overhead lines from map them. Here it's a crazy, it is a crazy start. It's the power lines, the telephone lines, the cable lines. And there's a higher, of course, the flow into the neighborhood, plus that. But as they move into individual homes, they break down shatter. So the homes are all  the ends of little to the capillaries. This makes neat. It is a little bit of a nervousness. It's an absolute good idea. Here's a map that shows the pools of light cast but each one of the streetpers. And it's black. And you have these pools of light. Keep that with us. Oh, I've got a wonderful map and it's every traffic sign. The traffic signs are each one of the drawn up map. And the thing that's fascinating about this is that the traffic signs are of course by and large people who don't live in the neighborhood. So their density reveals those streets where strangers benefit through the park. And then you draw them map, do you represent them? stop-sign because it'll get stop-sign. It's a good sign for the building. Absolutely. That's one of the extraordinary things we've done. I have a map of the pumpkins that were on the porches at Halloween. What's happened? That's an extremely interesting map. I  to relate to the map that shows the number of times each residence was a match. and well, I can use that for a half-time fight. You've made a map of that? Yeah. Take all the newsletters. You just know every address of the peers. Whether it appears as the name of an individual named Bird Oasis, the Sip Gadgers. And you just do frequencies, attached to each long thing. Yeah, references. So long. And the thing that's struck me about that now, right, first did it was that some locations, that some dwellings, are frequently next. no matter who was. And I imagine that the people who are going to be movies and shakes and neighborhoods pick homes that are in important locations in the neighborhood. There are actualists in the store. But they just got one money. Well, do you believe me? Money? Money is what's behind both the pumpkin map and that man. That's what you're timing to string. So where are the pumpkins? So far, you guess? It seemed  my where threeerex compared to these two people. work, something to do. Oh that's not how the map works. What I did was photograph the pumpkins with the at the face and then I printed them black on black. So all you see are the eyes and the mouth's pumpkins on the black background. John Carpenter would love this. So the map of the pumpkins is just a map where they're just little eyes and pumpkin now is floating by house. They're just floating on the black background. the traffic size we're floating. There's no, and the map of the traffic size, it just traffic size. There's no streets on the map of the streets that just streets on the map of the trees, that just trees. And what you do is you go through these maps as you begin to build up, even though it's never said, you begin to build up the kind of structural knowledge that you take away as a residence in that neighborhood. So, , the idea that we have to have the pumpkins drawn against the street only makes sense. you don't have any other images. But sushi of other images say, oh my lord, what? What were these pumpkins are? Why they're exactly square? And I'm asking them to be exactly square of people are mentioned all the time. And as you go away to the edges of the neighborhood where people are mentioned to be a son, by God they don't have a function in the conscious. And the people who are mentioned in the news are they can be bigger homes. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Yeah, is it true? How is it not that bad? Oh yeah, the repeating the neighborhood, the things carved into the, , some matters of setting the neighborhood. Patterns of yeast life that is, say, the light coming through the leaves trees, summertime. What does that sound? They are what it, what it is, but, neighborhood is experienced as, a clutch of patterns,  some smell, taste, communication. Tennessee, it most maps historically, it most, it most, something, it's a purpose, it's me that maps your describing, that's something very different. Yeah, they are, and they're very much involved with the search that I have for politics and cartography . But it's interesting, it's taking time. and I'm just going to explain this one to the world. And then pointing at things that you should don't think about. And I guess one of the intentions that I would make is geography. Also, it's the person. Is that there is an end thing that you can't imagine. There is an end thing that's something that's spatial, dimension, spatial curve, net, spatial character is interesting. I live in this dream. of maves and I keep looking for the mape that's going to really realize the potential of this thing. And it's the dynamics that is impossible to capture the world. But any of you have moments we think that that's the power of the map to be done. Yeah, I know it's. I know it's a part of the map. This in fact, I mean a map seems  what a map is in a certain sense. It's the opposite map, it's the meaning. I not it you all the information that everything by selecting  this map would be about this size of the world and this that would be about. Sure. Sure and that's why I produced an analyst which I have on one map age just based on this and another map age all drawings of the speakers because I'll be math is slim but I guess what I'm pushing for here is selecting subjects for card reps playing what I think that are all the those that are typically. No, it's something that you're trying to write in the box. I am, but with pure sim matters. Yeah, why not? Dennis Wood is the author of the book, Power of Maps. If you want to see his maps of boyman fights, they're not published in these lot of the post-view of them on the American- website, and address www.thislife.org It's a slide, word, words, words. Back to hearing. Since it didn't have to be a chart, one small slice of the world. Most of the people on today's program tend to be people who dissect you, the world who won't small, specialize with you. At some point Toby Lester started to know the sounds of the everyday sounds.

It was a very music hum, a song that's of humming and seeing for this place. Once he heard his ear, then Toby was in the unadvitable position. Not being heard, but not hear his ear. You too, or perhaps, probably. But Toby was an editor of the music. A musical guy, of's it. So he began to play with littlely harmonized, creating interesting inputs and chords, kind of barely audible music or small for his life in the office. Then I started working with some problems. Then I started working with some key-of-forms, as long as I had a little office. Was it a good one for you? I mean, that crying notes were too high. No, no, it suited me pretty well. So I was able to appropriately reproduce whatever needed happens to me. But that's when I start wondering whether it actually rather than my knowledge note there. my third or my third time. Whether it's factors and else. Playing it on top of here. That really affects, create my new form. What I found myself sitting in this little office. This is needed to heal it. During a computer, some realized yes, in fact, the computer was not nearly strong, but it was the hum and that, but, the thing that this type of computer has, figure out what it is. And, same time, same time, same time, but why it is, same, almost universally, to assume one quarter Santa, let's not explain it, justice, and then follows it in the process. How to find dirt with that. Awesome. Same problem. This is wrong. This is interesting. It's... You're saying that the heating system is wrong. This is computer. She created a dirt. So, shoot. And you show us on the keyboard with that. What was the name? So, the first note, this one, that was  the previous one. And then your computer was doing this. So, together we've seen the interval of creating this. Alright, the age of 30. Tap this. This is actually... Two. Tap. So, you're loving. Well, except for that, I spent the different times from doubt. Okay, , both I was just in the start of the three cool. That was it. Yeah, yeah. Come on, you're all here. No. Stop. Stop. Stop. Tough. So often. No. Ooh. One plate of music. Foundation. So, it's all compound. What is that? So, what note is that? So, that's the tonic of your kitchen. So, that's the tonic of your kitchen.

Well, traditionally there are maps of things you can see. And some of you are even maps of things you can hear, presumably those government maps with jet- which is meant to have airports. But I'm somebody who has a need to understand the world. to chart the world's objects through smell. This was not easy, and then we got zero note sciences. As a DNA company that's trying to make an electronic note. Sit. Nancy up dug headed out to their offices, prepared to report informed those frequently asked questions pages on the internet, quick warning to listeners before we begin. We have no idea. These are in fact questions that people most want to know about the notion just what's up. Good night. Hello and welcome to frequently asked questions about the electronic nodes. Those electronic nodes look  nodes. Actually no. It looks  a tiny table. It's a green 3x5 plastic surgery cord, but it's an exciting heater. And it's sitting on steel legs, according to his high. It does not go on your knees, it's the same. Sitting on top of the surgery cord, you're something that's  a black stamp. It's micro-processed. runs the main. At the other end of the circuit board, it's a white box that I would be re-intentioned by the black runners. It says 28. And then there's a clear plastic tube thinner than a personal. The nose uses to snip. But that's just the guts. Richard Payne is the project's chief tech block so he showed me a mark up with the outside of the final product. Just going to be a handheld black truck now. It might look  what they finally give it an outside. So, one would be able to push the black buttons to give instructions to start your stop. These are black buttons that are sitting on a yellow disk almost  a, , not a dinner plate, but sort of the next size down. So, the circuit. This circuit, thank you. What can the electronic nose smell and what can't it smell? The electronic nose drop or a lighter nose, an app, say, of its world. Here's what wouldn't be in the future. Blueberries, baby popcorn, and the wax. Pretty much every smell you think of. The electronic nose still will be. It has to learn smell first time, just  we had to do to drop. It has to build up a smell archive, it's a heater brain. OK. Here's what it's map-witting. Here are the smells that can identify so far and use a warrant this is small, sad world, right? New electronic nerves. In preparation for its life as an industrial workhorse, the electronic nose has been sniffing mostly nest, solvent papers, and decay bacteria. But when scientists want to show it off, they then identify two perfumes, the lovely Chanel Coco, and the mine is overly sweet back. Now, on the other side, we've opened up the bottle of first. Inserted the sample into... This is the first time you heard this, clean earring. And now it's a raw mode. And successfully I see now Coco. It's changing to fashion. What will the electronic nose be used for? By you and me? Not much. It's gonna cost you to $5,000 first. But mature. So they're going to spend the next five years coming up in the model just to do similar for under $10. Meanwhile, electronic nose have other assignments, detecting landmarks, factories, but electronic noses throughout their plants to detect dangerous gases might need to drink in-fetched process. Doctors could use handheld electronic noses to diagnose new momanic other conditions that have to save some smells. It's now actually used to be much bigger part of that. I'm just a stickie to tell. Richard tells me about one nation, not the next stage. One one neurotic nation. That wants to use the nose in a elaborate scheme to detect a counterfeit money. This unnamed nation was actually the German prison office. Wanted to inject a smell into their money, a smell that would be detected by Dnaza and Natasha. How does the electronic nose work? Before we get to that, let me explain how actual arms is working. The inside of your nose is filled with millions of little sensors,  sponges, a smell in the middle of the body. It's made up of a whole bunch of different chemicals, form of gases that combined create one specific odor. As we breathe in, It's all breathing, the gases enter your nose, and each chemical is absorbed by a different sensor that's prime to respond to that type of chemical. The sensors, the little sponges, then send signals to the brain, and the brain compines all the data from all the different sensors, and identifies their combination as a particular smell. Right. I'll repeat the question, how does the electronic nose work? The electronic nose works almost. the same way. Remember how I said it looks  a little table, underneath the table, it has a prop, tiny set of arms. Draw a smells in the tube, and the air goes up to the white box, we drain it. The box holds off the sensors, and some of the sensors swell, and we will whatever chemicals you can air be drawn in. Electroads measure the amount of smell. And the mic computer acts great to coordinate all the sensors. paired with pattern, the smell is  one. How does the electronic nose compare to a dog's nose? Dogs are used at air-poised, technical explosives, they're also used to take plant lines with new seed loops. There knows at this point it's pretty unbeatable from Apple's smells. It has 10 times as many sensors as the computer knows. even knows this half three thousand times as many sensors as the current version of the electronic mouse. But the electronic nose does have one significant advantage for the dogs. Dogs, they tend to a very short attention speed. It's been 15 to 20 minutes and then stand for another dog and there's been some train. And they're very good. that yours is the dog speed so fast. No, they stay focused for timeframes on the order of systems. They're good when they have enough. And is the electronic dose good as it does? It will be a long time before it's the status of dogs, but it will be... Does the electronic nose have a soul? A few hours into my business, I'm sure now I found myself in a book. Thinking about that dilemma at the heart of so many science fiction, at what point does the machine achieve humaneness? A machine who senses smell is just accounting up all the chemicals, which are older and naming. It's definitely smell. Real smelling is just different. It seems human. Real smells have associations, people, memories, feelings. We don't just help out. What we do and what we cost now is to spend the month different, most of you won't be able to try on a first-desk piece of research  any good scientist. Of course, there's no interest whatsoever in this idea. I won't play for you any of the five minutes of tape apart from that for about it. Except to say that he ended with, I'm happy I've ever personally loved. Yeah, good. what moments  this will lead. this narrative, voiced, wrapped all up, and have more. Yes, there are similarities and differences between the human those and the electronic note. For the key differences that powerful human computer, we call the bright, which lets us sit through thousands, even millions of different orders as we map our world. Looking up, we're going to map the city using your mouth, it's your guide. A little radio experiment in five senses, continuous taste, touch our left and minute, video for national and our program. This American life from our class, which you can probably post to the theme of the Radio of Riders, and should be the foremost heck of that theme today's program. We're bringing you five stories, five ways mapping the world, one through each human sense. This site hearing smell and now touch me. We've arrived at a four human touch. This is story about somebody mapping her own body using the sense of touch. Devon Rauhismet, Zeen Rider, and distributed to public radio stations, marketplace, and several travelers. It might be means that you're charting in a one aspect of the world. There is a good site being assisted with one. And of course there's a difference. Small thing began seven years ago. I remember the day. I'd park with my dog, stay. He's that man, I came across Nags and bought a girl about breastless. He was to warn his sons. Suddenly, didn't matter that I was in a crowded public place. I had to check. So I stepped my hand onto my block from check for loans. Not. Then I stretched out my t-shirt. Did you sign? What is that? Never noticed. The sort of offering up a little spin of my breasts. I didn't care to encard him into the phone. I followed my block. Nags. at the office, it nurses the last of the days after doctor and we look  he was trying hard after all his arms stretch first those first stretch arms that is good, but it's what it's got most people from panic and run into doctor that I miss, the catapult from the state into the world of contacts when I get struck I do five or six breast checks a day. If we get real-enate, that number goes out to the 40. I've pushed him prior to my flesh so hard that it actually proves myself. I've done self-examined dinner table in the middle of a performance of the Hollywood Bowl, and I hope they're not listening right now, but in studios and the eyes, I think it's all my soul. But it's not just breast-examined. My husband, Jim, can tell you when it all began. I did that 7 years ago. The balance and the feeling is very large and good. That's the first two I ever wanted. Is it free to? I think it was a, I think it was a, I moved to Chicago. I started getting to the bridge. I'm just, You have actual proof of the name. That's the word you work in the midst. You had a headache in true ways. You work in the midst of your stomach. You've been killed for three months. That's got to be. And all of you are too much in your life. You're too much in your life. You're too much in your life. You're too much in your life. You're too much in your life. You're too much in your life. The weird, so I'm so afraid I might actually find some. That I don't do my breast exams correctly. My hand hurts the ear there, eels around and then, relieve that there are no obvious lumps. My hand falls away, it's just burned. But knowing that I did a loud shout, I must do it again. And the cycle just hurts itself. Cycle style of product and fall to use here. He was a bad time in my life. He's bewildered that starting school and probably was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm not timid, finding all's memories. Someone an amazing offer to send me to write about you can get away with your stress at moms and the moms too. I was self-believed, jumped in the chest. Well instead of being a relaxing camper in the streets, I kept sticking out to that. I went back there in so many times when maybe asked about three points. I wanted a shoot of Satish, see me, conquer down on the grind, destroy the great, fluorescent light, stripping to the waste, let me shoot myself. I feel sweet inside, just a full camera from Satish and Do good I'm finally happy my show started Talking by a bookshelf, the spot of murder, still gets descriptions of the thesis and the symptoms.

There's a lot of times in the pain in that area we'll have a psychological pause for it. I would say maybe 50% of the time. 50% of the time, I'm not alone. Now you're not alone. What's this about? Knowing you as I was on the level, you're not just one of the sensations that have trouble. everything going on in life, it's easy to focus on something else to put your anxiety into. Many one point is to tell the pain that resolve which is positive and now it's the rest situation, maybe once you resolve and never have this in life, it might be triggering that fear inside you that will resolve this in this world.

No. It's a simple type of business. This is the problem. You start mapping a lot. We are pretty busy with this process. Demorale, Los Angeles. Acquied, mapping the world through taste. Done in Goldslif's change after he decided to map the city, one part of the city, by relying mostly on his senses. This story begins in the early 1980s who went back to where it all happened. This is the historic site of Mr. Pulse Loveler, which now is a VM science shop specialized in dingle Eric Koreans. Mr. Colesalberger is on Ticoville, but time I lived on Ticoville for four miles down over a push-up butcher shop in Jewish or Henees. I took a bus done Ticoville over every day from my job, because they incredibly boring Ticoville shooting job at a town family group. My colonel's data is supposed to be valid. who was at that time, that was kind of curious to see them. We seem to have the glamorous, light-wet, flying run from Latin capital, Latin capital, metaling everything, economies, and exotic and multi-try, e-e-reqsishic, Augustile, and economics. I had some big idea that I wanted to become bureaucrats. I think every civil service test that's possible to take. resource service test in the state service test. It goes off this test that the next security agency has to because CIA test. And finally, the problem at least it is on service test. And I got a fairly high score on. So I assume that I was on some point to the service. At some point during this year, I can be replaced on Tigger Bowie flap. or a district of Pulse Lab. And the district of Pulse Lab worked in Mutsch, I guess, in terms of breast problems. So, it wasn't a gift, in place I'd ever been to, in place I'd ever been to, in place I'd ever been to. Sort of a certain guy, you have counter to yourself, this science, and,  to be known as a district of Pulse Lab, we're self-blades of this sub. And, , air. I think that struck me about Mr. Kostlubberg was that here is a man who had found his mission life. His mission in life was put close long average. I'm not sure if he's very purpose with Kostlubberg on him, he's a first person I'd ever see. And somehow, I think he, Mr. Kostlubberg, or he'd be the other restaurant safety. I came up with the sort of 凡 slow and inspired to eat every restaurant on the robot, to create sort of a map of the senses that we're able to get into one and three of it. The next week that I was going to work and I had really not a PELF plan for teaching or realists to be the week that I was going to write. I decided to do that. And I came up with the set of books. tools. I had to go to each restaurant in order for professionals close  you go to the next restaurant on this but that means the next time I was out I had to go back to the one that I'd missed the first time. If a restaurant was really bad I could skip out after a fighter too. If place wasn't really a restaurant but say a candy store that also happened to sell hot dogs when I happened to try the hot dogs but I wouldn't necessarily have to make it part of my deal. as often this kind of restaurants, they closed down so so I went to the fight gone to miles and we were going to the restaurant that they gone to closed down and opened up again that I would have to go and eat at that restaurant, or I would have to go to the restaurant. Street vendors, , pushcards selling tacos or mangoes were often fried eaters, but I consider it a call that I didn't. So it became sausage, basically I think the idea is to eat how old gas that is the thing for exp çıkaran around all there are parts of probably the having the So, I'll solve the align with the, at least with Huawei R, to see the little symbol that go to the, Huawei R soccer soccer teams, the Chebas, and almost there. And it's set up for a huge concentration of first choose the Game Over Gear, around the time of the eye, so I don't think there's another switch in Los Angeles, let's play, play.

When you come to Elfarria, you just go and ask what you want. They know what you want, so you just go to the underground. And that's the area. Start up with some chips and peas, and bring it out. Big, they go. Rose still has some parts to say. parts, some stews, some stewy parts, and the parole bread is brought up on cosmetics, which is essentially a very strong blockaded app for those Egyptians and lots of shit. First, sip of the online, in the first sip of the consumame of the first tasting get a taste of salt. and then almost immediately, taking the back road, the chili comes in.

Especially in months, immigrants from Zuckateca State and from Haldisco, Tapulis, and there may be as many as a hundred of these specializing days.
