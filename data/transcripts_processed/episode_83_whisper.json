These drops, stones, palms, each round made it fast, which would run past them since it's got to run music. The chances of the class is right, farmers are country music, standard kids are hard to call it. And we'll get them the algorithm. Metallica. Metallica was a country. Metallica is one of the few groups. That's right, that's right. known as boundaries. The place, the nominee was constant. The songs, the nationalities were same-paw, our tide. Our residents were chosen to appear here under the name Jim Steele. The situation, a night, through the end of the school year when shots, the owners and farmers are together getting all more complex. Jim Stowners, he can convince a farmer, kid named Chad Richter, Smap Pot first time. We're a hanging out in, and we just had to go to this party, it's called bullshit. About 10 miles out of town, well in country, really just a machine ship, storing farm equipment, I'm not even sure who I'm property. So we pull in, there's five lessons to carve, and we're feeling pretty good, looking forward to more beer, and hanging out on a slow fratting nominee. And, , shit. Rickard, the guy that just had first smoked smoke dope for the first time that night. I get out there in a few minutes past and we're just hanging out, knowing we're not in talking, I don't think there's any music out in the road country. Just hanging out by the shed and I'll still notice there's something going on back gravel gravel driveway. This guy, Brady Henderson, his Chad Rikters best friend. Brady was an all-state wrestler. Really, really small here. But, why are you? pretty me. And he's in Chad's face is kind of shuffling him, getting angry with them, and people are congregating  it always happens. And kind of the next thing, next thing I see, ready to hand-send, does some crazy move, is tap this Chad, brings him right out of the gravel, punches him right in the face twice, hard, right in the face. He grabs him by the shirt, Sure, and still  what is going on with us with us friends. And ready screams at Chad. Says, Chad, you're a farmer. Farmers don't smoke hot. We drink beer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what happens. By rate the rules of your own social group. This is what happens. Insiders suddenly see you. And outside of it. and don't take chatter, we're small, we're a marijuana, . Well, from the VZ's Cajor and Public Radio International, it is this American life, my request, which you can approximate course, which is a theme, but ready to confines the greatest quarters of foreign screen stories on that theme. It's a question. One of us, how you get included, how you get kicked out. in the group you can. Back to one today, my crap life. We're going to start at the moment in American Latin division between outsiders and the settlers is usually the most high school in the long-term country in Japan. That too, my work life. Story of one public radio reporter who does down to tell a very public radio star story. About regular working joes down, Louisiana way. And what happens when the working joes decide that he is not just an outsider. The practice after describing them. Now we're going to hang them off the side of the freighter and middle of the night, we're going to read for his life. 3. My church life. Greatest Susan Birdman finds herself. Somehow. Name one at a time. Young Christians in America. And one of the students we participate with. And what happens when she visits with the other top young Christians? Say what else. I've won my craft life. This is beautiful, it's cemetery near my home, which is not for a great sunset. And not long ago when the weather was snow night, I was wondering, I mean, I didn't go. And we were talking about the snow night. That did talk about the snow day again, and we're about to return to our adventure, all conversation. And it's somewhere in this conversation, where I said me, I should go on. some might hear it, it's correct my body and take it back to you. Place it as no pets, place it as pets. My entire life, find the rug and that is where I would spend it for. It's really, your family makes it and for many most of the time of life, I think it was someone who abandoned us, and who loved us. They won't be fine, but... and you. When I get to sleep, you did not even accept as one. We have this... He looks up and says, me and my brother are getting a haircut on the front porch, I'm concerned. Three days before summer, I'm just going to cut our hair. I asked him, can't we wait until school's over? Now he says, me can't. I say, please. says, no, tonight's the night. I say, dad, can't we just wait three days? And he says, what difference does it make? I say it makes a big difference. He says, why? Because, because why? Because it does. My little crab brother says, ooh, you got a girlfriend, you got a girlfriend, saying no, I know. Ooh, he says, you got a girlfriend, you got a girlfriend, he's got a girlfriend, he's got a girlfriend, he's got a girlfriend, sure. But boys, they're laughing now, even my sister is too small to get him. Oh, says my father, so that's it. Well, it is not, I say, I just don't want to look  a loser. You're army nuts. Well, he says, you've got a girl friend. Why don't you tell us who she is? I don't, I say, I don't. I'm gross, not enough. I never had a girl. My mother says, don't let me in. Just laugh at all. But my father says, you better not start your goddamn prime for praise say. My eyes still. My brother is lap, looping. God all mighty my father says, I have never seen such a goddamn sissy my life. You say, oh yeah, we'll Charlie Demato said it was okay to cry. My father says, who's he? And I say, my French teacher says, he lets you call him Charlie. What is new? and I say yes he is and he's excellent. My father says yeah, he sounds  a classic fruit from me. And I say you don't even know him. You don't even know anything about him. You don't even care. I could hear my loser voice and lumping up on my eyes. So I got up and went to my room. I could hear them laughing. I'm not  that. This is lamb or corn. I lay on the bed. It's the moment I hear his voice. I can still feel the pressing down on me on feet water, drawing me up. I got my black comb, I have my backpocked, who is not my comb, for San Bruce, who gave it to me because I lost my, my comb right down my eyes and dead. I got the thinking about his gun, I knew it was, I had held black pebbin and I could go right back down there and get them all out. It's crying. balling themselves begging me not for something stupid. I worked at all and when I was that would have to say we are sorry son it's our fault I've made him say it again twice but still I'd wait to gun all around from  a lunatic I'd say I don't think you're sorry not for what you did then I'd go in the living room for 10 below my head up put a slug right through the floor that would be pretty sweet watching your run It's weird I will I saw myself here smile. Better. What a poly-award advice you can bring in your part. What if I get a note in my lock and start from poly-award and it says, come to her part. What if I want a proprens and lunchs says, I'll be right back to you. I couldn't go to a party or a pet. No way, no pet. Plus I could've stopped for squatting. I had taken four puffs of this beach's rag, but just in front of the cigarette butt. I was caught in a light-procise. You can't go to a party and you can get this as per samples. Then I got to thinking about it and why. I was sitting next. Chris happened to Apologites. Samford and I are every class, he has long air and sits right short, very dense patterns. But, yes, it's bad, . Chris Samford's name is Rick on Dests and Archie and Bals, girls even notes. Apologites happen in this rush, talking  a robot, saying, as wise you want on God. He rode the bird's tongue, darkened and claimed, ah, ah, wine dart sea was going over some crazy bit, ah, ah, ah, ah, Samford and I were in the back row. It's an orange plaster. I know these back rows,  hanging bathrooms. And that's what we were set fire in here. That's it. This raw sea was popular, but we were looking at them. Hell, when kids go to smoke drugs, we can take weapons, that's what I'm gonna do. All the hay works come down from the fence, to the flat, aided t-shirts and tight legions, putting their blood care back until they went out of sight below. My brain is fearing off force. This raw steam said, Chris would  to tell us what part will be likes to say? He could said, I prefer hot. to miss Rossine deemed it the likeness of Weaver, due to so smart. A minute later, Holly and Ingrid walked past her classroom window to wave that Chris. I was between Chris and Window, so they could have been waving at me. But I only smiled back, since the dumbest thing you do besides having to go to the platform is way back at some of his way to the person behind me. Always cheeks were bright red with something. Miss Rothstein was talking blah blah about the meaning of silence and didn't see Paul in England laughing and making hand signs of Chris. Didn't see me in the middle tipping back against the wall in my chair. I'm not letting legs slip out from under, since that is also a phone and a new stream. Always stuck her laughing head and back when they were not set and brody bluffs. Hey. She looked over toward Miss Rossine, who was still blah, blah, blah, blah, and said, Hey, Chris, who's your friend? Just cute. The sky was pale blue, and her cheeks red, and her air was blonde, and she said, Hey, Chris, who's your friend? He's cute. Paul Holly, swang, smiling, playing groups, and probably snowing. I was looking at my desk, thinking, Do something, do something, do something. Then Sandford held up his note before my name and big letters, and I turned back to see them gone. Leading class, this raw scheme gave Christopher to the face of smile, loaded in the quarters form. Everything moving away slow and run in the land. Wars were all tilted, and I had to lean, slow, and just walk upright. He was coming to get me. I could hear him pumping up the stairs from my brain. The door said, get downstairs. And he didn't get up. I was starving. He stared at me  the Satan was on the roof. He didn't walk in. So I sat up. This one, I think, will I, will I, and sat on the edge of the bed? I would write at him thinking, I am so sick of his life. He said, what the hell's the matter with you? Anyway, I said nothing, what's the matter with you? This is the second part of your life. What's that smart guy? He said, he's lit up on that floor. He looked at me some more that way, but I'm gonna say, He said, I'm gonna cut your brother's air first. I better not have the key back up here, didn't he? He left my lay back down on the bed. I heard the porch door open and shut, open and shut, open and shut. Thank you. in wine and the clippers. I thought, I'll jerk my head and make him cut my ear off the castle. That was me. He's dropping his knees, blubbering how he never meant to hurt me so bad. I could already see it. I had a tail white skull, my hair stood in the lumbest and me were. I was thinking of places I could go through period for boy pair of tattoos. All in. All in. wanted. You just want to throw some laughs. I said something. Slow motion, head back, air foot, space, and everything layered on through. The other guys look happy. Everything rolling under me  this. I couldn't go to Halley's part now, but at least the Ricky can make you promise, so at least I wouldn't get killed in part. standing there, sang up and bumped my zipper, and had trouble whizzing. All of this were there along, in the period. You think that you said, what are you doing, packet beating off and there? A fat cell, you beating it? Is gang, how to kid up and clock? It's beating, it half, yeah. Perhaps, the thing, he was looking at the twisted. It never seemed as fat skin, up so close. You should have said, yeah, I'm taking this, what's it to you, you're head, just let me kill my butt. I could have turned it, wisdom said, and answer your question, watch my, instead of swallowing and eating all the punch up the stage ring. So you can finish first, zip up, come back to heads. Well, I asked what you're doing back in. I'm sure the steam drop is shoulder-to-peeked, right in the face. and then pulled my dad's piece on it said, how about I blow a picture of something you're brain right from the wall, but instead of when you smack my head against me, you come in here and knock the picture in there and so shut up. Now I am just back in the past. I'm just special swimming classes and bloodbreakers so we don't have to bring you the block. I waited a bit, thank God I've been waiting downstairs. My father was in the store and my mother and his smile and smiled little smiles and shook me and I put my head down. A despassed man. When my brother was done, came and looked at me, heart, and loathing at me. He got my sister's sing with her. Hepe cake me too. Special Song just my mother said now kids my father allowed me to make me almost start up my body I wasn't she that's when we really did Got me out of the porch and turned the whole neighborhood and buzzed me food and rampos He buzzed me out I just sat there stony things that I didn't do it Clubs in here fell on my lap down Interesting Cl mas my teeth are stiff my father got a car and made me in my hair. I tried to make a level. He raised the clippers to try to put a straight line, his hands were shaking, and grandpa's. And jerk my head just a little so he'd get it wrong. He could admit he'd get it wrong. So we'd go and do some go crap. And the clippers is if there was one done. And then he'd come back to the front again and look at it. But he was really going to do it. jerk it again. After a while, grandpa's been issued. His hips gone. All right, so there you go. Thanks a lot, great job. Grabbed by shirt. Be better watch your goddamn bout and sit. Be better know appreciation, great thank you, Mother and I do remember. I made my face go blank, let go. Then I went upstairs. My scalp was  a giant fish belt for mirror. I got to thinking about how to get out of the school. Then I went on my finals and wailed that. The next day was third period lunch and how it stopped on the top. I was lying there for a long time and eventually I got an idea of how to get them all back. I would set my alarm, reset, and I would go into the basement and get grandpa's papers. The dead of night I would take the rest of my era, take it right down, fall, and make it  Sandy. In the morning I could just see it. I'd rather... eyes would be out of his head. Whoa, he'd say, radical. Who would stare in, oh, look. My mother would walk into the kitchen and say, Oh, my God, oh, my God, what happened? I wouldn't say it weren't. My dad would be grinding this mollus, seeing this handy work down the table. Who would be my brother would say, Holy geez, who would be? My mother would follow me around and say, Do you want to talk? This is what I do. What's happens to you? You're frightening us. I walked and door and shut behind. I wouldn't be feeling on the bus. I would have all my money, and my dad's peace and I brought it. I would not be going on the bus. Woo! I woke up. It was morning. My father's head was in the door. Get up, sir. You're going to miss school. I'm going to go to school. I'm going to go to school. Get up, sir. You're going to miss school. I'm on call up the bus number. I waited. Then got up and went downstairs. My brother said, Later, buzzy hit behind your sword. On the bus, the older kids were peeing back in my head, making lawnmower and army, male pattern baldness jubes. I can hear them in the back. I was trying to laugh  I thought it was funny. You couldn't say anything, but all day long, Santa who's dogging on the roof. I had in Lafayne, after a while I didn't hear some much. But at lunch, Holly came up and stood next to Sanford and he hung out with me for a long yellow hair and he wrote he laughed, and smelled it back out. My tongue was thick as steak. He was looking down on the parking lot downstairs. I knew it was just in where it totally went, but I must have wanted my hair to swim. I went to a barber. As important as lie on here with your pet inside she's far in. My only chance was to explain it. I'm shaking. I said my father not in here. I'm so bummed. If you're myself talking  this, as this is what it looks , it's  a total crap. Nothing I can do. You need to do that. What a nightmare. She looked at me  she just realized that I was there. I said, oh, I didn't. notice. Just  that. Ah! notice. Hit the song, but it's so funny. He's doing this. He stood there looking out of dumbsters. Kids were fun, they were pretty sure. I was fighting, dealing, and happening, the whole shape of light is crushing down flat. I feel it shoved right out of you. the clouds know where the sea is. Now below, kid about helping the squid and milk happens to move the issue way. All he lapin' smoothed the Chris' arm, everyone was lapin' 70. A couple of motorheads were killed all in seven-three, grass-ing sure letting go and get down to sea on lapin'. Look, kid's cup. the smile, which you can see from the swallow. He knew he just became a kid and got hit and swurred in the milk. For maybe three days, that's something to be. We go home tonight and his mother would say, where'd you get all that mess on? Sure. It's saying, it wasn't my fault he could ruin it at me. It's father would say, punch him out. It's just punchy kids out. He's father would say, I would have punched his lights right out and play. I'm holding my teeth and be honest getting bigger. I always stood up all the sea of dumps for a inch. I was a magician for a spare. The exploding milk kid walked up to a little seventh grade. His laugh and said something. I see the little kid saying it didn't grow up. I'm not in the court to let a big kid spend for a second. The exploding milk kid was already in the little kids face. Thanks. Wish. The milk kid's friend walked up behind. He pulled a hand up his pocket. Whoa, Santa's, it's nice and awesome. Seven greater walk back and hold his face. He ripped out a curb. The milk kid pushed him all the way down his face. His face is in the stomach. Oh my god, Alice, he put her hand to him and that watch. And see her face. She was half smiling, watching, let's warm up. face. She grabbed the Chris's arm. This is dangerous. Everyone stops watching. See Pinecchi's feet start now and they'll. I kept waiting for teachers to not have to stop or little kid for her in worse. No kid was still kid. There was blood on the sea. The other kid was blood on the sea. She's. No kid kicking one more time back and stop. He let these lips run around. His friend Bradley's knee started for the bill. I couldn't help it. I was crying right there and part of it. I took the step backwards and started for the wall. We can see Holly looking at me and he sat down. I was crying part of a new Santa and bird staring at me. It was a... I'm not going to do it, but stop. 10 MLA is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Miami, Ohio. His story, my crap , first period in the sun. Here's to those who love not to... wisely, no not wisely, but to well. To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell, to the guy who throw party, if he knew someone to call, hears to the losers, less or more. Here's to those who think that the losers are when. that lady doesn't show. But I'm coming up, anatomy of a public radio feature story shot to hell because an insider became an outsider. And  the moment of Christians, in a minute, a public radio international. Wait, wait. This American life from our class is going to put in the course which is some theme, a lot of digital infimSean Satoral ti- Skip your numerals so many things are related how to write something We have arrived at two of our program, from the friction command pitch, kind of lessons to adult head, social life work by. If you're in any workplace of any size at all, as it's inside is an outsider. Some rules and codes, which we may have to move from one to another. There's those in total, usually very hard teams. It's a business. At the market stage, for example, Gulch-Kagov, with high standard training. for their crisis is for court values and catalogions. Considering they might be talking, it's when it was for the Vancouver things , say I'm very not paying and I'm offering something and someone offers it one fraction of a price better than me and gets the whole trade that's called a party trade. So they park your mark, they take the whole trade. They're , well I was just a fraction of a trade, a fraction of a price away. The owner deserves some. Tech in vá with me. You just have your price wasn't good enough. The best offer is the best offer. The best bid is the best bid so they take your trade What am I gonna do next time? Sorry, right? All right, proceed that you've taken the straight bike car for your market. I'm gonna try and car for your market. Best car markets. You're not staying excited very far. Well, this next story is about two people in two different kinds of jobs. The two different sets of jobs. The end policy is probably... radio reporter whose story is usually in crisisite often considered. Did a series where he wrote across the country and agreed to us. It's a very special piece of metal on the way. And while back, he said I had to do a kind of quintessential public radio feature story. Story about the working man and it all fell apart. I'll visit working man side in this case that he was not one thing. I let him leave the energy to the last town. group. It's about 90 miles south or beyond the end of the road. Happy to take a boat to get there. I let town built entirely on stills, or houses, or cars, or swam. They're only 16 year round red, as names, yes. Violet. There are no lead group of men, mine, rope, ladder. I'll take it. Up the side. Ask the traders. their jobs and navigators, treacherous narrow strikes, round treaches, super, over sandbomb, two in prom, go for next. It's  breading the eye of the meat. I've always wanted to be a part, remember just being a strike by the whole idea of it. The first interview where we two young apprentice, I was waiting to get a wrap. Ever since pilot's so strong that he can... and then not fathers passed on their jobs, son. As a result, there's never been a pilot that's not what's named. But without any pump, one of the friends formed that this nebulous is one. It will soon be a thing to have. Tom change. Okay, you might be one of the last groups, go to here and see the process of being far about views for a year. Neptune, mic embassy. might be on the way out. I do to please follow up on questions. But there ever come a day or women in the North admitted to the Association. Here I had unwittingly wondered what forna's name. Turns out pilots are a little catchy about this. Found out later that NWACE is threatened to file a loss, less pilot of the Association opens things up and it's a life that a lot of people. think they have , yeah, I think he has a rule. That's Gary Ma, who ordered who a hated friend got. He's been a pilot for years. God, who had a question for him. So, what's his question? Oh, I'm afraid you didn't want to hear. The morning after I interviewed him and the apprentice, Ma, confronted him, I was anxious. He shorted and musked and piercing Gargah. He's not a guy you want to get in. That's just what he was. He apparently talked to the apprentices about dairy, and had somehow glued it that with in pilot dig up dirt. Who do you think you want? Coming down here to stir things up, calling us the white males club. When I explained the issue of diversity from the islands, black there are not focused on my story. And then one of the apprentices brought up in that one. That's the first place. It only made matters worse. That apprentice was a very mobson. stocked off and you've never from then on every time I was walking through a room of pilots they'd stocked off first I thought I might be a match but it happened just fine ate a lot of meals so pilots did not just to ask when I was training lead one day in pilots TV ran I decided to break the slime look you guys have to believe I'm not out to make look but we don't even know who you are You could be anybody. It's true. I could have been anyone. All I had was my radio. And I hold this this time. Video. And I worked for. Oh. My assurances that I was a legitimate reporter fell on death year. More I tried to explain the guilt of my seat. 1961 reached all the way down, pilots out of the galaxy. They're the radios. Look  Dr. John, how the set practice moves you, French. As soon as I was with the rational black pot. What complicated things further is that my host, I would smooth away this geo. back to Lincoln was caught in the middle. He tried to tell him couldn't promise the other pilots that wouldn't sell either human or some way. But for Trayden, his white males are here, Matt could take heat. He pleaded on numerous occasions at a print man's man, broke touched racism. That he'd come back pilot there. I come to pilot town first place, let the outside world know about it. One of the few romantic confessions left, Marqueen, for this one. Highlight was one of the only unfettered and entirely independent human beings. There's on here. Now, these unfettered and independent human beings greet on one thing. I come to destroy their way of life. I was the enemy, all because of the issue, had an even rage. Everything was going wrong. Old-qu projects were great sales. I'm the most loyal soci programmers out here with home health. shirt, my phone call. The 83-year-old postman's pilot here at Woodstock. And the president, pilot's association, is called down in the world. See what I was up on top of that, because it's in bad luck, pilots, sked. Had to wait for them to go out on ship, actually. So while I waited, I wandered around outside, and collected the sound. The river, laughing against the dock, ship was blown by River Bird's chirping. insects, buzzin'. I collected hours of nothing started small sound effects lifers. I even tried to record some fiddler pads, scurrying back and they're whole. Didn't have much help. Finally, I got my chance, climb aboard a ship. It was sometime after midnight, in the moonlight, I could just make out the silhouette, giant victory. as left the dock, transport room. They overheard on my head from Vodap, picked up my max wireless microphone. What is he doing here? You're gonna get on that ship? So much for seven hours. I was about to climb up the side of huge moving tank, wildly broke laddant, I was scared. I knew how important Vodap breed is was. Yep, I'm moved. The ship doesn't slow down. Smaller boat has full up long-sighted, so we grab. The ladders dang no but the song. It's  scaling up the giant steel wall hundreds of feet high. Rocks back for it. The long move by the load up, I can fall, lean too fast. The number of experience pilots have died this way. It was ludicrous, and paranoid, think about foul play. But it did cross my mind. By fell to my death, who would know? Any clues on my audio? Stread it. Ships rudder play. I didn't want to think what happened to me. , blah, blah, blah. Remember, nice old. I climb up the rope-flat, one sweaty hand, over the other. Shins banging and stood with slap. The river flooring below. I'm peering for my life. I'm all on. -huh. I got into radio, because there are millions of people whose stories you never told. Where you end up? Some of them, right? even that. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My church. So this is a very limited book and she mentioned her own Christianity. And a long after the book is published. She got a coffee cement. The total achievement was in the top 51 Christians. What are you saying? Making a list  this is a sort of hard publicity start. for a major world with it. It's coming to you people magazine does do circulation. They name the 10 best-dressed people in America or the 10 sexiest man. Something a rotary car, the middle-sized Americans, suburb or city-matured and short-handens of charity dinner. Seems... I don't know. The neat Christianic. Christianic. Which built middle Europe, which has the possible sort of all and bad luck. Susan, Nicholas, to say, did I not know this? This is very partial. I would love to be included when this particular group of questions are on matter. You are on our list since the news was on the last issue. Three months right of this year in the deal. But there is time I could interview for a profile. She calls for the same football. Tell me about the last things. Immediately uncomfortable before the use of evangelical up-and-comers. They're inviting all 50 of us to the Convention of the National Association of Evangelical and the Indian. You can get to know each of them. As well, move on the most, I ask. So I call myself Christian, who don't call myself part of the world as well. I dare to believe it and sauce that on Jesus' insights all the way. and a heavy lady. He's not screening HIV, building the Hebrew, or asking whether the male son has had a divorce or a divorce. The woman on the other end of the line doesn't understand my history. You're not an evangelical, yes. What are you? This is a pretty big first. I'll have to think about how to answer more and see. And I call you back. I walk out of the steamy bomb of the land of one of the refrigerated plants across the street and the diverse students. I follow science to my frustration. I'm already taking names here at Fine. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Standing there by myself. I look around for someone I know. Are you a pastor's client? She smiles in a situation for a subject. I'm on 40 and hear myself say, we dance so well as we offer in the super-match. Oh, with the group of you, she adds melancholy, types my first name only into my voice. The main meeting of the day is already under way when I find the auditory. Pull of what looks to be mostly 58, 61, and live a stop for the evening. I look around. Now, wonder something that the mutants make of rest. Among the 800 or so leaders of this loose association, 48 Protestant denominations, which gathered with their enemies convention, only 30 of them, so look  they might have been born from the 15th century.
