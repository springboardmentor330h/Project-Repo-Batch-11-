You're not going to have else for, , no, they get, , I tell them they're... amount and they give me the money and I'm saying that if you grab out and also know oh wait let me give you  five cents and then you can give me this back  and they  totally I but end the day my drawer was totally off because it's well my mind the last minute I'm less I'm getting a really nervous I can't do this I can't do this I'm gonna clash back some seven grade  failing math I can't do this I can't do this You're not stopping you I was at the worst state Hi Dude little math tricks with the chain in our way. Oh, that's crime. No. Both NVIDEs, Chicago and Public Radio International at the American Life, I'm our class. Each week on our program of course, we choose a theme, but a variety of writers, quarters, of performers to take a whack at that theme. Today's program, conventions, and who will become one day  10 Kms. It's got one, dark shadows, but it happens when 2,000 people come together who have nothing more in common than the fact that they watched television, act to, dish out of water, in which dishwasher peat brings us the story of a lowly restaurant employee who attends the national convention designed for restaurant bigweights, his own bosses, act 3, one world's collide, the story that starts in a convention, center with two different conventions happen to be taking place. Which two different people, some different worlds, happen to me. So what happens next? It takes them far from the convention. Same ones. Pat one. But what's Katherine really wanted to go to the Dark Shadows convention? Katherine was one of them added. These, as we're John says. It, it, it filled something in. her. It was almost  she was an empty glass and dark shadow filled her glass. Whatever was missing in her life at that moment filled her glass and she could watch it continue and would laugh and roar and so involved with characters and how many would you watch? This is good that fact that's it. It was much of an 8 hours. Eat hours dark shadow. Eat hours today. Everyday. The slow. the most creakyest TV show ever. Darkshed is the Catholic soap opera from 1961. Main character is an avant-garde vampire in Barnabas Collins, storyline shifting from the 19th century to Groovy's 60s America at its most modern. Kind of weathering parades needs Austin Powers. He knows a day of it. 1275 episodes in all. Beginning on the train. Oh my gosh. My name is Victoria Winter's. My journey is beginning. A journey that will bring me to a strange dark place To the edge of the sea, higher top widows hill, A house called Colin Wood. A world I never know, with people I've never met. Do you cast them? It's now 3 o'clock in the morning and I'm at an contract train, heading towards New York. Thank you. right about now I mean Syracuse Ohio. I'm thinking about you. I'm thinking about how this was all your idea to go to the Doctor's Shadows Convention. True I introduced you to the show, but you're the one who really took it to heart. I feel  I'm going on a journey tomorrow. It's your need to meet people that I don't know. I'm going to do something to be common with people. When she said she wasn't going to go, I had to think, do I really want to go this convention? Is this something I still really do? And I thought about it, and I thought, I haven't been thinking about going to this convention since December. It's August. I have been talking about going to this convention. It's been  on my calendar, I've been hearing, I've been buying clothes for the convention. I've been saving... money that  I've been eating ramen noodles for lunch and I'm going of course I'm going to go to this convention even though This show is just to show to me. I really want to go. It's I want it I want it Talk about dark shadows with other people that  dark shadows I get a listen to this American life maybe remember it last Halloween Good as an anti-up that can I visit it, John and the friends facts in Erica during the weekly ritual watching Darkshadows. And I'm here to tell you after everyone, several hours of this, it's boring, it's slow, the acting's terrible hotlines are from posters and apparently take months, sometimes years to resolve. But it's live TV and it's got that feeling. And if you watch long enough, you can see people who get lines, scripts, a left on beds during scenes, pop guys get caught on screen. and see them through doorways, flies, settle on the actor's faces. And this is part of what John and his friends thought from they watched. John watched his six hours of week, taped off the side by two. you notice,  the little things you wouldn't notice in the regular show,  we noticed tonight, the people have stopped knocking on the door three times. They're now knocking on the door four times. Oh, go on the back, wait, no, no, no. You stay right here. Right now, so make me go back to the door. No, that's funny. They jumped and say, had a lengthy meeting with the society that you have to have four knots instead of three to spice up the problems with that. It's not exciting. the new director said, , we got to get rid of this old, this old, the old ways things are going to change. No more of this three knots, so. So, John goes to New York on the track. alone to a convention hotel on Times Square. Katherine doesn't go because she got a job, which tends to cut into people's dark shadows and have it in a rather major way. I'll be honest, I was really patrified because I was alone in New York. I don't know anybody. And there are probably about 400 people all waiting in line going to this banquet hall to start the ceremony. the opening Dark Shadow convention serum and I'm walking around and I know that everybody here I can walk up to them and they're talking about Dark Shadows but I don't know if I want to at this point and the last time that I at the last time I actually remembered that field was 10 years ago when I first gone into a ducate bar benuring self and thought  this was something I had to do by myself. I was all alone. And there it was  in this room with people that we all had something in calm You just come out and just come out. We all had something in calm and I knew that all these people We had a similar life experience. We have one thing in calm And then you get for example with the Gabriel you can't just walk up to somebody and say so you're a homosexual to me too I'm now at the conventions and you will use that word right now I'm in the Grand Ball at the Mary at coffee interview and the layers and they're probably about, I'd say a little bit over 500 people here right now and they're doing a retrospective on some of the dark shadows actors who had passed on it's just funny they're 500 people sitting in this green wall palm watching TV We all go into the ball to watch TV. What? That's the opening, sir. So, so 500 in the news of Little Tiny TV? No, no, no, no, no. It's the TV. The TV is huge. Jimmy. There's a little quiet and white 12 minutes. I hope you all gather around. Because when you think about it, it is a convention about watching TV. And I had thought about that until that exact. moment I was going that was it's sort of so I'm here to watch the computer watch the computer talk people about watch the other thing I was there for was to watch the people make dark shadows they make their own dark shadows you're getting me  using footage and you're just no no no they can't you should actually have this episode so they make new episodes they make new episodes of the episodes of the episodes they get costumes and build sets I forgot there's this one, there's this one, it was amazing it was a parody of the show but a parody  if you watched it right now you would go it could be funny but no it's all inside jokes if you watched  Dark Shadows it's the only way you think this is funny but it's so unlaboured they had built  completely rebuilt the set of  Barnupus's drawing completely. They had, and then  another set was in a graveyard. And he completely done the graveyard. This one man played three different characters. And it was edited. it was completely professional. I mean, they must have spent  a ton of money. They had gotten one of the original cast members to come and be in the video. It was so incredibly elaborate. It was  45 minutes long. And it was good. And it was  the thing, I'm sitting there going, this is really good. You're at this point? Well, I put on my red bird and the crushed velvet, pierced her down, jacked it, I got into the pelvis for five bucks. It hit  a little water spot. I hit put on my rhinestone broach that looked sort of  a flaring song with this big, huge rhinestone. Great in the middle of your right, the middle. which I tend to myself, so-so-shared black pants. My shoes, which were point-poll and shoes from the 1960s show. I mean, I got found. John is the only one there who dressed up. At least first day. Everyone else was in shorts, summer clothes, casual clothes. Which makes a person wonder. Am I the weirdo? John would get on the elevator wearing his convention name tag with non-convention hotel guests. and they would look at me, then they would look at my back, and then they would look at me again. I sell at that moment. I'm the weirdo. I'm the weirdo and mellow of it. I'm at a dark shadows canvas. This feeling may be more extreme at a dark shadows than that. Frankly, it is common to any in their imagination. the elevator into a badge, separated from the rest of your tribe, surrounded by civilians. It's easy to feel  a suit, even if you're just an actor. But there are freaks and there are freaks. John, for example, would not get any 800 person 5 hour vines to get autographed from the stars. On the other hand, in three days in the world's most exciting vibrant city, he never lost the hotel. Then he went to this panel for all these issues we were so happy. Stop. I'm sorry, some dark shadows were there answering detailed questions from the audience. But this woman gets up at this panel discussion. And she has a pre-prepared state. And the statement is, , it's  I want to thank all of you for all the joy you've given me through my years. And she said, when I watched Darkshadows, I want to take the high road. I want to think of the things Darkshadows has given me how it's taught me to forgive, how it's taught me. taught me the joy of friendship, how it's taught me that you need to go on from bad situations. And then she said, in most people, we'll listen to this and they will think that I'm a crack pot. And I'm a crack pot, so beat. And then she screams into the mic, Dark Shadows lives! And you see this , look at all the actors' faces , fear,  a Hammer, little bit of meere. But it dawned out. This was  the statement that I had felt  that I had been sealing a little bit and she is standing up in this room full of people and proclaiming I am a crack pot. And I was thinking, well, I'm sort of a crackpot too. Here she was. It was sort of  the alcoholic getting up at the alcoholism. It's , I'm an alcoholic. And I thought, I left it. And I was just , this is what this whole convention is about. We're  all these misfits. And at this point, I was feeling the sense of community. And I was feeling this in the sea of crackpot. I'm crackpot with them. I'm kind of dope. I'm brother, I am with you. But John, I mean, but you sort of saw her as being nuts. Right. But you thought she was speaking for you, and she said, I felt it empathy. In just not, not that I'm going to be the one going up there screaming. I am a crackpot, Dark Shadow's rules. No, you've chosen to say it to 400,000 people. Go, baby. I'm sad it. I'm sad it. I'm sad it. Do you want to say it louder? No. You can't. I don't want to say it. Do you want to stand up? We can. No, I don't want to say it. It's okay. It's all I want to say. Recently, I spoke with Chris Crowley, the facility's managed with the Masconi Center for San Francisco, one of the biggest convention centers in the world. But he told me there's a kind of life cycle to conventions. They happen in predictable phases. First day, everybody's a soaring. He said, last people were still individuals, not a group just yet. The second day, people start to group and begin to bond. find those little packs of people. And by the third day we can mention, there's definite friendships that are made, groups, and people that are following each other, and you start to recognize who your peers are on it. You kind of create or they create their own little herd mentality, if you will. And all this happened to John. On the first day he didn't want to talk to anybody. He felt  we were going to. By the second, he found some friends at the volunteer desk. And the costume ball. And these people seem  they were pretty fun. So some of the people I had talked to during the day I said, let's go back to my room and I've got two bottles of room low and let's all get drunk and talk about dark shadows. But then sadly, John discovered the inevitable third phase of any convention. He got sick of it. In this case, too much TV, too much marching dice, too many pictures and videos of dark shadows going everywhere all the time, much airing. We look at the morning of the third day with a cheap wine hangover and everyone needs to talk about fine and discolans again, or at least with a foreseeable future. He had to force himself to go downstairs to the final banquet, which he'd already paid $45 to attend. And this other guy was sitting next to me and we talked a little bit about this show and it was  he started talking and he was from Long Island. He asked me where I was from, I said Chicago. And he said he had gone through Chicago. Yeah, he's... that change the subject of sports in about the balls. And I don't talk about sports. I don't know anything about sports. I don't even follow the balls on championships. They're going on, which actually is very, very hard. It's  trying to eat. It's hard for Christmas if you're in a new era. It is everywhere  this. And I found myself sitting with this person at this convention, talking about the balls, talking about the balls and Chicago. And in your normal life, you see, youaa you you somebody will try to talk to you about sports. You would be thinking to yourself, I would say to be talking about something  Garc Chattas, right? And there I was I was engaging in talking about the bulls. I was saying, , when you were in London, did the bulls' championship go on, where were you, or you, bulls' fan? Now, are people talking about, , and I was changing the subject. Then we talked about the cubs. They don't talk about the cubs. And John Honest got home after it. 24 hour train ride. We have in the door and I hope you click this video machine. We have recorded six hours backshadows. Today return, the city wasn't sure you'd be able to watch them. Three days later, watch five. Actives. I'm a dishwasher. I'm having worked the rest once for over a decade, but it only makes sense that I attend the National Restaurant Association's General Theater, will get rid of. But it's not an organization that welcomes restaurant employees quite country. A dishwasher peep, writer and publisher of the Zine dishwasher, original and plenty of candidates life, as a dishwasher traveling place to place, a small mission to wash dishes in all 50 states, plus whatever other dish washing stories topics goes a great event. Who's visiting the National Restaurant Association is made up of restaurant owners, managers and suppliers, they are a force to be reckoned with his country, especially They, are virtual directors, all of creators, and investors. they see, the importance of the minimum wage and Bill Clinton's national healthcare plan for each. The National Restaurant Association's political ally, New King, which is stated that their lobby was instrumental in defeating healthcare person. So, the group that worked so hard against interested me in my restaurant colleagues were going to hold a powout. I felt that my responsibility to be there. writing up the escalator into the middle of Chicago's performance-placed convention center, I was immediately overwhelmed. I displayed everything imaginable concerning the food service industry. Every sort of cooking and serving a plan to utensil food products menu designs, everything. Each booth was highly specialized. They didn't have an impressive array of napkin rings, and they were peddling theme outfits, so a restaurant staff dressed up  pirates or clowns. I had kind of expected to find groupings of press-cut owners smoking this cars, rubbing their bellies and exchange of tails and having stuck it to their employees. So where were they? In the meantime, there was something on my agenda. Something that's always on my agenda. Free food. Plenty of food products were available for sample. I nibbled my way along. I honk a chocolate here. Of this. She burger there, waffles, chicken tenders, stir fry, jelly beans. This part didn't seem so bad. That was until I arrived at one of the boosts giving way for a beer. There was fierce competition to reach the bar. Being jostled from both sides by guys in the suit was bit unsettling. I hadn't planned to be so informal with these people. I came to the show to be inconspicuous and to inspect that the socialized rub shoulders might otherwise be my boss. After I finally served, I stood back and watched the last types of cushions shove their weights in the free beer. I turned and watched another crowd of glass types, clamoring 3C, 3 plastic key chains, at another booth. This, to me, is weird. I had expected that with this many glass types in one haul, the air would be thick with authority. Instead, these authority figures were giddy over receiving plastic trinkets. It was disturbing to see all these boss types of weight from their restaurants,  being in the sixth grade, seeing your teacher walking on the street, holding your boyfriend's hands. It's just something I don't care to see. But while the gathering of the boss types seem rather innocuous, I assume the capitalist bereave would be in full swing, as I headed to the convention's keynote address given by Republican Senator Bob Dough. But at the time I took my seat at the back of the room, Dull was well underway. I listened. I became confused. I think Dull was confused too. Who was supposed to be given the keynote address to a group of restaurant tourists. Instead, he gave what amounted to be a campaign speech as if he were still running in the election that he lost last year. He shouldn't have given Dull. He didn't even have his exact addresses. Dull. Okay, thanks. desperate for any more so related to rest-wrested Kevin Dull's mouth. Didn't ever came. I began to sense that Dull wasn't quite sure where he was. I had assumed he was yet another political lackey of the National Rest-Run Association. But now he seemed more  the grandfather, a family dinner who baffles in comprehensive room, called the rest of the family's tooth-light draw attention to. As Dull had drawn on, streams of people, apparently having heard enough, headed for the end-of-the-questions below for me. I had hope to ask him something , hey man, why are you in the National Restaurant Association always trying to keep the dish washers down? But in each of his responses, as he drifted away from the question, I realized, I couldn't ask a stunt and I was questioned of this absolute mind at all man. He could have said, maybe he could provide some grand-public advice. Mine was the last question. Hello, Mr. Bell, I'm great at National Restaurant Association. So, that's why I'm ready to be at any improvement in my subreddit, just to ask his opinions. I was excited because Pine was the only question he actually answered. Just keep washing. At first it seemed  a good nature to slap on the back thumbs up piece by piece. But as the band played on, those words kept echoing through my head. Just keep washing. Yep. Just keep washing. day after day, just keep washing. We kept a week, month after month, just keep washing, year after year after year. Put the hell kind of advice as that. We kept washing, year after year, just keep washing. The Treasury Peak searches the National Restaurant Association, traces of the American Dream 1 that Bob Doe. would actually approve of, that's in a minute, the public radio and international, win our program continues. To some American life, my request, each week in our program of course, we choose a theme, bring you a wide variety of different stories on that theme. Today's program, inventions, we are in the middle of act two, dishwasher peak, real-life dishwasher, at the convention of the national responses. Working as a dishwasher, I'm often told, start here in some day, may own your own rest. What's wrong? Boss has tell this to Dishwasher's all the time. And it has true. It may not have surrounded by 10 to 1000 of former Dishwasher's restaurant convention. Do you have much experience watching Dishwasher yourself? I can't say that I have. I've not only at home. Do you have nothing to do with that? No, it's really not that. Dishwasher's are invisible to most restaurant customers. But why was such an important part of an industry being ignored at the scattering that's celebrated every aspect of the restaurant world? find some of my fellow dishwashers. I stopped past his wife asking him if they seen any dishwashers walking around. I received one negative response after another. One restaurant owner Snivey told me she wouldn't think of bringing her dishwashers to the show. But then I realized there was one place I was sure to find some of my dish brethren. a mouth to the flame I had a straight to the Hobart display. As the largest manufacturers at Commercial dishwasher equipment, Hobart is legendary amongst those most wash dishes for a living. Their model dish machine would surely be staffed by real-life dishwashers. Hobart's display was quite a spectacle, puzzling with activity. It's a free beer and dozens of chirpy saleswaves where I matched bright blue shirts. I have expected there to be bikini-clad women, launching a top-are display dish of shirts. Mind your own. aty crudear song. Dindung guitar song Can you see that? Yeah, it's a beautiful mówią. There's somethingized about this compact size. You can't see theCLAP yarn. There's a blackisch Anyway it uses aansa water assist, and also it uses to click mark in. You can't see that by clicking the subscribe button. for finding this washing camaraderie didn't pay no. First of all, there were no dishwashers operating machines. In fact, machine set idle and it didn't find much kinship with the Hobart sales force. Hobart's very be-lock showed up their new sink to turbo wash that circulated water that hands the soaking of pots and pans. Well the dish machine you've got to have somebody to man it with this you don't want. So you're able to desay for kitchen so to speak. So it's a big labor same. Yes, it's more expensive than a three-carbon sink, but it's less expensive than having a full-time boy. This shows up every day. A full-time employee does. What do you think about the dishwasher, as you may possibly face may ask because of a labor savings. And they were saving you twice the business. This does not take a very qualified person. It allows one person to do several jobs within a dish or a activity instead of having two people to do. to separate jobs. So it actually is going to help out giving more jobs purity to the person that is working in that dis-ruberia. That's not why we're happy. Well because they can do more within the dis- thing and operate the distance. Both Hobart sales rep that I talk to told me that not only have they never held dis-washing jobs but they hated doing the choreo home. What sort of dis-machine representatives were these? To me, they were  surgeons who hated the sight of blood. I love the Hobart Display at Bit-Djected and check out some of our competitors. Champion-dish machine companies can have been more different than the Hobart Display. They were, unlike the massive bright and crispy Hobart crew, just a couple of middle-aged guys wearing flat brown suits. He spoke to a guy named Peter for a while, asking if any dishwashers have visited through. None had. as I was about to walk away, he asked the guy's dishwasher pee. It was kind of spooky, and the cover was blown. Peter introduced me to Hank Pope, the president of champion. He had written a year prior requesting a copy of my publication dishwasher. I kind of can believe that the company's head hunch of father to attend such an event. Who has even worse surprise that he remembered who I was. This washer pee goes all basis, because his goes all over the country's wash and dishes. Is he right? out of him puts out this little book every week. It's funny within the DevOps. The part we wanted to put some of his articles on the web page and sent them at some of the consultancy and all that. But we have to add it to the little bits by seeds for some of them. As the chef and going. She's been fine. We're not overwhelmed with this. Well Hank and I talked to you. She said he's over at the last time. They have previously scotted at the champion guys and thought that I find solidarity among the Hobart group. The Hobart folks now look  the incredible high school, the jocks and cheerleaders for popular yet shallow. Meanwhile, here were the nerdy or champion guys who grew late more to wear as come in front, so not entirely. While Hank and I did have a good conversation, we were from up to end to the spectrum. He, President of the distribution company, me, dishwasher. bun! He did find an actual fellow dish dog. He had to show his winding down, and left the crowd's promotion to send him three pike to stairs, and he deep down into the ball so he can convention center until I came upon a door. I push the button next to the door and moment later, it buzzed open. I wandered through the labyrinth of corridors, peeking around corners, and acting as if I belonged there whenever I encountered someone. And then I heard of familiar homin' the distance. How you doing? All right. So you're the man behind the scenes, huh? You're the man behind the scenes, watching the dishes. Yeah, yes. His name is Jesse, and he was working alone in the cavernous district, unloading dishes from a huge 30-foot log from bare belt style machine, just  the ones on display upstairs. Everything. there's anything our radio audience should know about a man behind the scenes down here in the dish room. I really got another say something. I  the job. I  the job. We have a trouble out there to straighten our work. The employers are nice people. They're easy to get along with. It's just a return to the head of the dish machine once again low dishes into it. That's what I used for the first time all day. I watched Jesse loading the machine from afar feeling  I needed to speak with them more at our bond needed to be acknowledged. But then I noticed the condition is extremely cheap and I knew what to do. I put down the tape recorder and got to work. I walked over and then loaded the clean dishes. This was the Pete Zine. This was her as a bill. It's available for a measly dollar at PO Box 8213. Portland, Oregon 97207.

Thanks in internet for all these aventures and options so be happy There will always be a living. When words collide, the story begins in the convention. At two conventions actually, John Perry Barlow was at a convention in 1993 for the next computer, the machine that Stephen Jobs created after he co-founded, Apple Computers, the other convention, the American Psychiatric Association, our story starts in the border of those two. Jeffrey Barlow is a former rancher, songer, says now head of the electronic frontier foundation. He travels everywhere, talking about computers, and that is what brought him to the Musco-Ni Center for Convention in 1993. And I was supposed to be giving a supposed to be him to see. of Steve Jobs, Celebrity Roast. And across the way, the psychiatrists were having seminars. So before we even go anywhere, it really does sound  a wind-world's quiet, so it's totally. Yeah, yeah, it was. Because the thing about a convention is that each world is so distinctly, it's all right, world with its own concerns and its own priorities and its own paradigm. Oh, yeah, and... and... , both of these groups of people were so distinct from one. I mean, psychiatrist as a group had a look. And next years, this was, this was, next was one of the only computers I've ever been around, where the whole notion of design was really important to the product, the elegance of design, and it attracted. the strangest kind of hybrid which was sort of  Unix Weenies by our Monty. I'm Nation. Okay, and describe the, and describe what the psychiatrist, tenfold Bible was there. Well, the psychiatrist, we're all, , the sort of Jewels' Fyphyr cartoons psychiatrist to eject this. Slightly rumpled. Right. And  this. I think difference between the men and women, really, except for this one person. I was standing outside the entrance to the ballroom where I was going to suppose the rest of these jobs. In the psychiatrist, we're all milling around over there in their court. And I saw women... standing with her back to me. She actually looks dressed to be more one of us than one of them. She says she's very crisp, our monotlook from the heart long blonde hair. And she turned and looked over her left shoulder and looked right at me. And I've never had an experience  this before since and I've always thought The whole idea of love at first sight was one of those things that was invented by Lady Noglus with three names from the South. Right. Because Hacking this word, what's the process by which you would recognize something that profound. Yeah. She looked and we started looking at each other and we didn't overt our gaze either as we were probably 45 seconds and just locked on the... And I felt  I felt  I was having hallucinations, and I felt  I was hearing voices. I was just just dreaming just then. And then I kind of stepped back and rub my eyes and tried to figure out what I was gonna do about this. You literally rubbed your eyes. Literally. No, it was an odd, the whole thing just felt really dream-wise. I was gonna say it's  in a storm. Yeah, it went into this surreal state. And so I finally, I thought, well, I can't, I'm not gonna, whatever's going on between this person. I mean, I have no experience this before. So I circled her a couple of times and then finally I can just say, you do see. She said so or you And I said well, where are you from? And she said I mean I I didn't know I assume that she was part of our shit I thought that actually what she was Didn't occur to me that she was associated with the psychiatrist she knew it came and I thought that what she was probably was what is her I was there really better term for this, but the general computer trade show term for this is Booth Bimbo, which is somebody who stands in the booth selling the incredible difficulty used software, who's actually a model or an actress or something. You doesn't know anything about the software, but the marketers sort of angle her out. She's bait. Right. And then once once she's so good. and these poor innocent hackers still wander over, say they're stuck with the girl, and bam, they got up. Right, geeks move it. Right, geeks move it in hustling muscles. So, and, but I just see. I'm honored, practice. Right, exactly. It, it, it, it works. So, and so I just assume she must be a booth and both because she, as much to be a booth, a computer. Or is that kind? And I'm, and that David Donald. So, and it's great. She was. But I said, well, where are you from? She said, well, I'm from the little town of British Columbia. She was from the little town of British Columbia. She was from the little town of British Columbia. Where do you live now? She said, New York. And I said, well, I see you in more of your seats. That's where I live. I said, where do you live in New York? And she said 19th and 3rd. And I said, well, I said, well, I said, I have to fart from where I live in. To lower the system. And she said, where? And I said, when we were 15, and she said, really, which building? And I said, see, it's the old Fifth Avenue hotel in the 24th of That, which is really. Well, it turns out that I just got an apartment. In fact, she had just got an apartment. We say it's the two stories about mine in the same bed. So, there wasn't this woman that I had an instantaneous, unenixplicable attachment to. I was about to move into my apartment building. And we just went off together and actually... Move them together really literally we have week after we met So when you're at the convention with her you spent easy spent all your time Oh, yeah from that point forward and and I also it was it was a great opportunity for me to introduce her to my world I mean a lot of it's other than which is because The great for that was having a concert in Sacramento What are the nights it was just competitions We were never, she saw her first dead concert and this is person who never had been caught dead. Dead people too. Explain your connection with the baby. Oh, I spent many, many years as their sort of junior birth. Some, there were two, some of those names. Lesson two. And so what did she think of the concert? What did she think? She liked it a lot. She thought the dead had her fast. and I think the music was great. But the other things that we were just completely, hopelessly, the side of each other, I mean, , I could have taken her to a dog side of it. So, okay. It was just one of those completely unexpected acts when I was completely unexpected acts of provenance, where there are two worlds collided in it. So, we were cute and cool. Do you think that if you were to met this woman in some other set, just on the street or seen her in the lobby of the apartment building that you were to have to shoot with them? Do you think that you would have had this moment quite so powerful? Or do you think that there was something about being at a convention where one is just... open to experience in a way that one wouldn't be elsewhere. Actually, I think she was, she was, at that moment, she was more inclined to judge things more on their basis, their appearance. And what she mainly saw was guy, real sharp, suit. The next day when I returned to my normal style of dress, she was, wait a second, is this how you usually dress? I see. Yep. She said, oh well, aren't. But do you think that if you had seen her just just walking into your building three weeks after that for the first time? I think this moment would have happened. I think that it probably would have happened anyway. There was something about this particular connection that would have overridden any surrounding noise in the data. I mean, I felt  I had finally met another another memorable truck. and he felt that before I said anything to her, she said. What happened? Well, what happened was we had both had the slew. She was young woman. She was young woman. What happened? Well, what happened was we had both had the slew. She was young woman. and very helpful to stream with the carrots. Athletic. But we both had to slow and then it real nasty slow. And it had a spos kind of hit none, maybe five out of eight. Close to the month. And I got out to... Los Angeles to give a speech. And Tim Larry had gotten some tickets to Pink Floyd cancer, and those boys. And she was going to come out and join me to go to this Pink Floyd cancer with Jim. That all got ball except we ended up going fire cells, and having very long complicated evening, with a lot of waiting and traffic. with the third card, what not? I don't know. Can you bring up by yourselves? You and Cindy, you and Cindy, you and Cindy, we are here. , and over the course of this evening, we decided that even though we had been sort of being, we didn't want to think about the future that much. She said, well, I know that, , it's supposed to think the future bit. I think you're not sure if you have children. Then forget it. do that, I would love to start soon. If we're going to do that, then we should be very know you feel that. Then is it fine? Sure. No problem. Anyway, the next day I had a meeting and just let me say what is Sunday and I had a red eye back to New York that evening. Cindy was going on then. and this is a look in the second patient's tomorrow. Why don't you just take an afternoon flight? And I'll be home to see if something comes to work. And so she took an afternoon flight and I think it'd be her port. Gaby tried her a very big kiss and she said, she said, nothing can keep us apart. heart, we are in need for you. Then she just walked on to the plane and went to sleep to connect and then turned out to the virus that we both had, the flu virus, and to attack your heart and have been showing away on it for the previous 10 days or so. We welcome soon the pair of carding. So, eventually, it was so compromised that as she was sleeping, she started to fervor laying in just town. She was two days short of a 30th birthday. We went to tell her to put her seat belt on and come into JFK, she was dead and had been for me. Oh my god. So, it was, I mean, this whole episode from the moment I saw her there in the hall of the A&A to the moment where I walked, watched her walk on the aircraft. Was... one of this really central passages of my life, and to that we can just do. And smaller. Well, no, no. I actually wouldn't say that. In many ways, not at all, because... One of the things that came out of it was that prior to this I didn't believe in the soul. I mean, I think that, , within us were two spirits that it all, all we get, I mean, there's really just no way to say this or that sound incredible, sapy, but, , we were the same soul. And having seen that, that changed everything. Now that you had this experience with her, do you find that you have this experience? All the time in a smaller form, you'll need a group of strangers and it'll be one whose eyes strikes you and you think, okay, this could, I could see a part of this thing. Absolutely. I mean, I feel , , I feel... ...indulity. to attach, , in a moment to moment basis, there is completely  anything I felt prior to them. And, , I think it's sometimes a little disconcerring to other people because it's genuine on my side. And people are not used to having somebody just dock emotionally that instantaneous. For one thing, I feel  I can see their souls. , their souls are visible to me. One of the things that happened is past queues of this, is it? It's a while direct, but it's stop moving, pain gets a bit. that I could stand. So I fell into a lifestyle, continuous motion. And that gradually became an economic adaptation. And now I just simply live on the road. Pretty much. I say 277 miles last year. Just on one earlobe. God, I mean, I'm just hearing you said. It's , you. when a guy on a plane too . Well  it's a funny thing. No I'm not particularly interested in dying on a plane but I mean that's kind of  I really feel  the stratosphere is my church. That's what you feel  you can contact her. Well kind of. I mean I I feel there's something about being up there that makes me feel  I'm closer to your ear. No I totally understand. Is this a glass place where she watched? Yeah. But it's more than that. I mean, , it's  last night I was flying here to Salt Lake in New York. And I looked out and it was just, , I don't know. I believe we haven't quite liked that. But I mean, it looked exactly  heaven. There's in paintings of the interior of the late Renaissance. Really so get light. New moon. and how to do white clouds. Maybe that really clear kind of, yeah exactly. how clear they are. And there were layers and layers and layers of different colors of clouds. And we were all catching the sunlight and golden blows. And yeah. And I thought, well, , what a great life. It is that puts you in this unbelievably holy environment on such regular basis. For me, there would be the additional thing and I wonder if this is for you too. I mean, maybe this is one of the things I'm not just a slice and much, but every time I would get on a plan, I would just think, okay, this is her sadder. what I mean? It's  this is, oh, this is where I left her and she could be in any one of these seats. , it would be very hard for me to not be picturing her in one of those seats and just sleep. Yeah, no, I mean, she's there. Even now, even just a hell of a shirt. Yeah, no, I mean, that's it because I say it's not something that goes away as well. Yeah, it's a permanent fixture. And that's okay. I'm glad to have it. But anyway, it was a hell of a convention, no? I mean, I'm sure glad I went to that stage. Jump to your barbell.
