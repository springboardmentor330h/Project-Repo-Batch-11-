I would argue that all of the miracles by the art form could which we truly excel as a nation. The art form which more Americans practice than any other.

So we dear skull. reliably, for Wall Street to the pollsters and market research firms and purpose group operations all across the fooded plan.

And I would argue. Nothing wrong with that. And in any case, if you have any choice about it, so we may as well decide to feel good about the whole thing. To help you do that. Today I'm ready to program inspiring case studies, and some horrifying ones too. Hold gamut. With WBE's Ishiicago, and public radio international, this is American Life, and Mariglias. And today it's program. sales. America's greatest art form. Back one of our show today. Had to talk your way in half million dollars in just 45 minutes. And that accented single of what companies are Hollywood's screenwriter as he tries to sell a movie idea. Two. JL sell. That's S.E. L.L. So it can be any hot in which a true American salesman gets thrown in the slam up or simply being an entrepreneur. And has a few words to say about the movie. me. I agree. Who's the man? You have the story of how becoming a salesman can change your life, make more confident, make you able to charm anyone. And why you might decide that that's not so good thing. That poor secret to being rich and happy. The life of 70-sits your old salesman, Jimmy Roy and Braddock, Pennsylvania raises the possibility to being a rich salesman, being a happy salesman. Might be mutually exclusive. Stay with us. That's one. I'll talk the way into a half million dollars in just 45 minutes. Friends, let us consider one of the many crossroads where art and commerce meet and ask the question, is commerce the greater art than art itself? In a first story today, writer Sandra Singlow takes into a setting that as an occasional screenwriter she knows well herself, I would pitch meaning. Move into videos. made. And we thought we would start a show here because it is a sound situation where the stakes are enormously high. We think it is decided very quickly. And we are people who often  to think of themselves as artists. And we writers, producers, people  that. Are basically forced to be salesman. Here's some. I'm with writer Scott Fycher, two days before Big Movie Peach Lady. We're in a small office nested deep in an office building on Willshire. We're Scott works on the writing staff. Beverly Hills 90210, a waning spelling TV show about increasingly long in the two teens. It's not where he wants to be forever, but Scott really wants to do is write movies, big, funny movies, and he's had some luck. For years ago, he sold a pitch to Colombia, a kind of list of strata but with football widows, and was paid to write the script. Although it's now in turnaround, Paiatus, Limbo, no more money will be forthcoming, etc. Scott knows he's a good pitcher. and writer and that he has a really funny new movie idea which he's pitched so far to seven producers. In fact every producer have gone through his responded very pleasant and very excited. So that gets me excited and I think wow this is going to sound. I'm going to sound this pitch. I'm going to be rich. So what happened with those seven so far? They didn't sell and I'm not rich. That's so cool. Friday is pitch number eight in the move. industry, different salesmen have different styles. Scott approaches the pitch  a performance piece. He acts out the whole movie, goes into different character voices, loads on a lot of detail. I am a little worried that I'm giving them too much information and it might pitch as tend to be a little long. They go about 20 minutes. And I know other people that pitch just trailer to the movie. I was talking to Andrew Marlowe, good air force one. , when he goes into a pitch, he's just  Arnold Schwarzenegger, apermative or coming back from the dead and meeting Satan and he turns to the camera and says I'll meet you in hell and that's all he has to do when he sells a million dollars. What's the secret to a million dollar pitch before we head out to the big meeting for a quick primer on pitching theory I turned to veteran pitcher Bob Cosberg, reputed king of the one-line pitch currently a producer at Merff Griffin Productions. I don't know that they're great or that they're legendary but I can I can give you examples of pitches of his soul that had them. sort of one line, two line, hooks to them, or premises that were very high concept that when it was executive heard it, they right away got the idea. We sold a project called Man's Best Friend, which is really about a dog that had been genetically enhanced and then went out of control. But the key line that sold it was to then say, in other words, Mr. Executive, it's basically jaws on paws. And then the jaws with paws does make it a better movie, but it makes the executive remember it. It makes the executive remember it, and so it's a cute. little glib sales tool that will allow them to take your pitch and go down the hall. Remember as much of the pitch as they can but then in the middle of the water forgetting it they can say. But I remember the poster it sort of jaws on pause and they can get the laugh. It's  telling you good joke. The joke travels well down the executive corridors. We sold a story called BuzzBee to Turner. That was a fun pitch because we actually brought a dog. Everyone knows that Taco Bell in Chihuahua. Well a few years ago there was a dog that was very hot from another movie I just bought a kind of remember what you do it to dog even was I think it was a dog from as good as it gets But we took that dog around the studio to pitch meetings and the dog was that it attention with a pencil in his mouth I could take notes, but ultimately the pitch was the story Thus be was the story of two guys who wanted to steal the world's smartest dog right off the studio A lot dog was working at Paramount be said making a movie a talk hard three. Well, once we got to the point in the story where we could say these kidnappers break onto the studio lot, steal the dog and bring it back and wait for the phone to ring. We could stop the pitch and say basically as ruthless people with a dog and it helped me to dog was in the room. So sometimes I'm not above cheap stunts. As Cosper goes on to describe other legendary pitches he has sold, Norma Ray with long legs, the last boat, a bat midler for charity. and it mix up Capricol's scrambled eggs. I realized that, paradoxically, I'm much more entertained by the pitches than, well, I'd probably be by the actual movies they'd spawn. Think about it. While the phrase, jaws with pauses laugh, the 90-minute hilarious summer movie version of jaws with pauses, with a cart chase, and a teen romance, and a wacky cameo by the comedian, Sinbad, sound a little painful. Which makes me wonder, have we come to a point in Hollywood history? when the pitches have become better than the movies, when the pitches themselves are somehow a pure form of movie. Bob Cosberg says, sure, and why not? Well, that's one of the wonderful things about pitching. When you're pitching the story in the first meetings, everybody visualizes the movie they want to see. It can only be the best possible version at that moment. It can only get worse from that point on. Because then you have to write the darn thing, and directives come in with their version. Of course, to give credit to all the talented people probably with some pen. they take a pitch, writer, director, the stars, the studio, make it better. But you're right, a lot of times when you're just pitching, what's great about that stage of the development process is it's all about the attention. Scott, Fyfer, and remember that his brilliant, Lusseless Strada football widows pitch is now lost in turnaround limbo. Couldn't agree more. That may very well be true, it's sad, but true. The pitch is as good as it's going to get, and it's just downhill from there. You keep getting notes on how to change it. I should be good for all these other people started at Ignarton, Yenson. It's frustrating that I still can think of that pitch. I think I got that such a great idea that such a movie I can see and it started Julia Roberts, I love it. And it'll, it may never happen. And that's so frustrating. To avoid frustration, Scott knows that the producers he's pitching to Friday are looking specifically for a liar, liar type comedy, which is the very type of movie he's pitching. Although, depending on his audience, he can also pitch it as a dumb and dumber comedy or a nutty professor comedy. How will he know his pitch is succeeding when the executives laugh? Who is he pitching to? To successful and in-demand producers, who's most recent movie is being released by DreamWorks, Dan Jinks and Bruce Kelp. I am sure that I meant these people once, sometimes they might not remember things. Thank you for writers that I mean, producers. It helps if  the people. because it is much less comfortable when you're pitching good things. So, it would be nice to be actually have some recognition when they get my arms. They don't. Hey, it's gone. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. I'm gonna recommend you for a ride. Red cubes, a slush star screw. Yes, they'll actually be happy. But that's a nish. I picked a lot of things. Hi, I'm. I'm here. Yes, let me cue you into what's physically happening. Dan, Jinx and Bruce Cohen, the producers, are settling themselves into chairs on the right side of the room, which is fairly bare. These are relatively new offices once they've just moved into. Scott, looking subtly nanny, and yet casual, and black buttoned down DKNY shirt and black jeans, is settling himself into a chair on the left. It's extraordinary, even the clear. division between seller and buyer. I mean, Scott is here to pitch an idea which Dan and Bruce will either buy or reject. It'll be over as soon as he leaves the room, possibly even before he leaves the room. Anyway, let's extraordinary, given that there are literally hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake. Is the intense sense of casualness, openness, even democracy in the room. Everyone's 30-ish or so? No one's in the suit. It's as if the stakes are so frighteningly. that the only way anyone can get through this is if everyone does their best to pretend nothing's at stake. And so the producers are bantering with us and more importantly, they are practicing that peculiar playing field-level in gamut. You might think of as the rich will of the water. As a result, waters, I think. That's a very exciting little great influencers. Now we bought a picture of your couch in, so it's black to open. You didn't get a lot. In a nutshell, here's what the plastic bottle water, traveling hand to hand from producer, buyer, to writer, seller, tends to meet, and the water always travels buyer to seller. Do writers ever bring producers, bottles of water when they pinch? No. Anyway, in my personal experience, the water is a courtesy gesture that always implies a lack of something. At the beginning of a meeting, we don't know you, have a water. in the middle of a meeting. Leslie Ann here may be nothing more than a poorly paid intern, but even she deserves a water. At the end of a meeting for an unsuccessful pitch. In lieu of actual money, here, take an extra water. At this moment, rolling around on the floor of the bike car are literally about a dozen half-filled plastic bottles of water. What the water is also is a batcher helper. The pre-pitch factor, of course, being another key democratizing ritual. How was your drive over? You can find our office okay? Yes, I did, but that left turn on the Santa Monica. I hate that turn. The four basic modes of executive banter are what? How was your drive over? We know some of the same people. Three. I was just reviewing your work, which I followed for many years, and thinking how much I especially love your piece on, you'd be surprised how rarely that happens. And finally, of course, there's the dreaded four. Sorry, you had to wait for 40 minutes. It's just that my son's 10th birthday party. is happening on Saturday and the whole household is in an uproar. In general, the actual contents of the banter is less important than how long it lasts, which is always a delicate matter. I mean, as the pitcher, you don't necessarily want to be the first to pet the banter off, abruptly transitioning a warm, us-focused, human-route into a crude, me-focused, how I got something to sell you, real. Also, if an executive encourages a long period of banter. It can be a good thing because it means. I'm loving this conversation, I'm loving you, Eddie Murphy and Joy's working with Dutch Earth people, let's make a deal. On the other hand, it can go on too long. I once went to a pitch meeting at a major television network where the executive told hilarious stories about herself for 45 minutes out of a one hour meeting with apparently huge enjoyment of listening regular rhythmic halls of laughter from her sub executives. She had literally talked so long, I'd forgotten why up. was there or what I was supposed to be pitching. All I was aware of was of my body tossing forward and back with the others, slaves rowing together in a kind of merciless comedy galley of polarity. Perhaps you've noticed the hilarious TV sitcom, Sutton Lee's Andre, wasn't on last fall sketch. Scott's transition from banter into the very act. selling his perfectly smooth. He unobtrusively takes out a stack of his 3x5 cards and says. Anyway, anyway, so I have this dish for you. Yes. And it's not going to be much about it. I don't have any. I'll tell you what's coming. And that it's in the main of Lairline. I can't use that. I'm almost... I'm going to go out. So, ready? Our hero is TC. to carry and Mercury on the sand there. He has a music goodie, he's thinking he's a speedy. And he hates a T-hate home. He's thinking the cookie's a H-B-n-S-E-S-E-C-C-C-C. And he hates a satty logo, which is a sacred photo. He's just good at yourself. T-C-F-M-O. The premise Scott is moving toward what's calculated to strike the listener at about minute six or seven of the pitch is. What if all the scenes your mother ever said to you came true? And after the day he keeps the doctor away, crowning your face will stay that way. Slow a- a watermelon seed and a watermelon will grow in your stomach. It's commercial, it's funny, it's well worked out. And yet, a scum pitches off, exuding confidence, calmly flipping his index cards. I remember a thing he'd set to me on Wednesday. When they're not laughing if there's a long gap, I probably makes me talk faster because then I think, all right, I'm losing them. I've got a speed up here and get to the next point. So if I even speed up and talk faster, then I'm gonna run them for a few weeks. off the cross flow. Then  I think I'm in trouble and I'm trying to get to something even funny here and I'm flipping through the cards  when for me, it's funny thing! And now, mid by through the pitch, I realize Scott is literally talking faster than I've ever heard him or really any other living human being. Talk before. T.C. is completely stopped, , but he has to eat it all because he's not an advertisement, he's  coming to the garden he doesn't want it, it's not that easy. Now, C.E.O. Throughout all this, Bruce occasionally laughs, but Dan makes no sound that all, which is sits there, smile. Is it a warm smile? The civil smile. I can't tell. Around minute 13 though, when Scott gets to the big masturbation joke, clearly starts to win the moke. And to my surprise and relief, the ending of the pitch is warm. She gives him a long passion and kiss to hold him over. Thank you, sir. And Esther. So this is what I call it at the end. Lovely. Lovely. There you go. I would say, , are you open to hearing about hearing thoughts? I'm a horse. I really  those thoughts. I had a couple of thoughts right now the way you describe this guy is he seems . It's almost too much of a shpuck. It's hard for us to have audience to care about what happens to him. I think that to make this movie work. more, more, better I think that we need to have the best of this sort and it in him.\" Dan and Bruce critique the pitch for 10 minutes, and I'm usually long time, and it's hard to know how to read this, does this mean they're interested for that they hate? And then, at the end, your final question is, have our notes made sense to you? They don't promise they'll call, or consult with others in their production company. This does not seem to vote well. Thanks for the moment. You're cute. Now the only thing that remains is the long walk to the elevator. Before we leave the building, I make Scott duck into the only private place I can think of, the ladies lounge for a quick post-mortem. So how do you see the beach when you're sitting there? Obviously, what? Great. What was the experience  for you? I felt it mine while I could tell the main one. I'm going to get into it in the next tension. Do we really need to fly this? greatest. Intival ladies lounge suddenly appears a lady. So any other thoughts about how it went through? No, I mean they gave a lot of notes which usually differ things. That's more of a race right there. And sometimes , because you're just , alright, then what kind of data I'm done here, you decide. I don't need to hear. I don't need to hear. , you're possibly something else. That's a good idea. and they were just a little things that were major. And I know that you may have never been able to see some things, maybe I said, just you can't even think about these businesses. So there goes for a more important thing. Thank you. Scott heads to the elevator, and I walked back into the producer's offices for a quick Cisco and Ebert on Scott's performance. So what's your feedback on that? And, shall we start? You're going to buy it or go with it or something? Yeah, we'll do now. We'll do now. is talking to, and obviously talking to each other, but because we talked a lot of people pretty much agree with what we'll call Adam Shomu Brie Rose, where Scott's agents and have a conversation with Dan about his achievements and his achievements. And so, good news for Scott Fife, he sold the pinch. A half a million dollars could be hit. But first, Dan, Bruce and Scott have to go out and pinch the project to a studio. The studio. will go out and pitch the project to directors and stars if they make the movie and are successful in pitching it to theater owners in order to get the widest possible distribution then the actors will take it out into the public it will be Jim Carrey Eddie Murphy for Adam Sandler sitting on that chair next to Jay Leno bottle of water and hand and after some preliminary banter when asked with the movies about if they're lucky they'll be able to say well it's kind of a jaws with and the studio audience will arrive. Sanjutenglo's off-road way show aliens and America opens in Los Angeles this August at the Tiffany Theater for a limited run. She's writing an original screenplay for DreamWorks. The first time I've seen the video, I've seen the video. Back to jail cell. You could argue. And in fact I am arguing it. that the purpose of today's program. That selling is what this country is all about. So imagine the outrage. People are thrown in jail for doing nothing more than being salesmen for being so profoundly remembered. This comes up in Danny Hawks. Show Jail's hospitals in hip hop.

If you make every sale that means you're only going for the shortest things and there's just not that many short It so you're not going after a month He said the sign that you're succeeding. They're making people through your sale. You're sales so It's really important to embrace them saying no it means you're going far I had this boss who had been in sales as a whole lot and he taught me that when I started feeling nervous, it probably meant that they were feeling nervous and that was good. In the more good I felt about it, the more control I had over both of our nervousness and therefore they were just minded by it. of it and I was encouraged by it and energized by it. Then I just stood a better chance of coming out and we went on. Suddenly I'm going to these sales calls and I'm just, I can't wait. , I'm running to these sales calls. , I'm putting the elevator button in the bank for fast. Because I can't wait because it's all sorts of, it's a feeling of power. It's really spot to go into a meeting with three people who are much older than you. a lot more money than you, who are what we're telling the world and do. And  that you're going to be the guy in the world who's totally calm, they're going to be really nervous. And I loved that. I loved just being the cool guy, being the calm guy. And I loved creating these relationships, the type of relationship I've never had, which just is lip friendly relationship based on, we empty chatter about the weather. to the developed a steering that was really popular to the issues. One major function is to provide conversation with the actual conversation of the, , you just say, hey, do you remember last night from the famous at that point? That was funny. Remember when the lane said this to , that was funny. , and that's how it served. People. do that today. Next day I'll call and do that to the next. Do you see? ? I started realizing. It doesn't matter what you say. It doesn't matter how bad it is. All that matters. I felt so good. And then I gave them the illusion of something awesome. And I found it at first. Hmm. He kind of amazed me first of all have quickly, I just want to say it. First, how much I joined. I mean, I sound  I would do things and I hadn't,  I would hold doors of the way down the elevator to all the women. I would compliment people on earth, , regretting. the chocolate. That's very fun. I used my hands to sort of ways that I had learned so maybe it never pulled it over my chest. And my whole voice which was my whole app to the point where when I would hang out with my friends, it would make fun of me. Why are you so... When your friends would say this to us about how you would change, were you in any way along? No, I loved it. Oh,  I had to. , go any, talk to whoever I want. I'm a f***. , I had always had trouble with me. No, I had a hard time asking. Suddenly, I would ask about any. ... But I just felt  I could put up. is persona. At least in my mind. Smooth. that person. I . , there's something essentially optimistic about this. It's very generic. Very weird to think. You don't know as an optimistic. It's not to make a learn. Why you got that? know what was wrong there, how you can do better. And I think this is not actually a separate thing. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. There were a few times where this whole process really felt  the violation of some felt I went too far. Here's this guy. who was president of the major and he wanted to buy. We turned out to be a lot of money. It would mean a lot of money to be a person. It was a big decision. Even though he was the president, he was trying to establish his own base within the company. They didn't want to be a particular station that should. felt  I had always known, I knew we wanted to. But I prepared the charts that made it seem  we would. I gave him the ammunition, courage, fight with the fight. And he was really fighting. There's this one moment where he and I went out for drinks, private Vince... was another part of the song that I had for that period of time. Not meant to. And he was really opening up. He was really talking about the relationship. His fears is being seen. Whether or not he wanted kids, that would mean to sort of how he ended up with the business man, what other kinds of lives could have led. Could have led. Excuse me, sir. And it was awful because it was so awkward because he really bought my boss into this. Really saw us as friends. To be honest, I had these moments before. I had clients. I'd even gone to college, and I started finding that when I hit these moments of sort of boss into this. There were a few stories, but a few sort of set pieces that I felt comforted, seemed  they were emotional sharing. But really, we're just kind of set pieces. I felt very comfortable ordering a price set, I was working for eight years now. But they kind of gave the illusion of hope. So I threw a couple of those at him. But I just knew he would never be a, I would never open it. in that way, in my fantic. And I couldn't tell him, the what should be on. Can he price six? Because he's already on. He's already on. I couldn't tell, and I wasn't. He's moody. And I couldn't tell him, I didn't want to be as... I didn't want to be as... I didn't want to be as... I just remember who it just didn't go. They didn't seem to be any way to deal with him. So I kept selling to him. And eventually he will have that come. And I never knew if he got fired. So I never knew if... I never knew if he had anything to do it. He might have lost his job there. Yeah, it's possible. Any questions? Yeah. I mean, but you do also have to, at the end of the day, you have to decide, look, they are much air-spending burden in it. But they're spending the money based on the information I've given them. And only the information I've given. Just instance, do some noise, however. to the recent part. Speaking of either of course that's  saying shame on us. Red? Yeah, it is. So... At four, the secret to being rich and happy. The usual it's two stories, be a man. Americans tell ourselves about our salesmen, about our own lives as salesmen. There's the super salesman story, picture-piece the early days of Donald Trump, and there's the tragic down-is-lock salesman picture the man in anything by saying, David Nammatt. For a more accurate work, at the life of American salesman, consider-piece Jimmy Roy, Diamond, Jimmy Roy, 76 years old, leaves him works in the town not far from Pittsburgh. He's sold everything from used cars, to antiques, to jewelry, all with a philosophy of sales that was created in the South. As many salesmen have to pay the cost for themselves to get themselves to it. We'll put it down constantly As Jimmy Roy tells him there was a time in the 1950s and 60s when he owned the town of Braddock, Pennsylvania Okay, they just down river from Pittsburgh But not everyone in Braddock remembers those days. Hey, don't know me Know me When I'm a split in milks attribute the crowd listen to him cute I don't know, Jane Roy, do you saw all the property here? You said I don't want Bill British, you never need, no? Sir? Okay. Just to hear the car light over here, I'll just build these here, I'll go on that house over here. Yeah. No? All the dirt on your building, the furniture stores down here, the two furniture stores. Okay. I don't know. The chicken shack, or chicken shack on fifth street. I think I can. Yeah. Take a piece. I don't know if we can get rid of it. Back then, Braddock was known as the Valley's Greatest Shopping Center. On Saturdays, people would come from all over from the sidewalks and cams and shoppers. Then the steel mill started shedding it. People moved the way. Suburban mall springer. And no one came to Braddock anymore. Time is wasted, ladies, Braddies from heaven. Don't  we fly today, ladies from heaven. by the mid-70s, Braddock was becoming a ghost town. It was about this time that filmmaker Tony Bubba featured Jimmy and one of his short documentaries on the road. That's Jimmy, they're singing. The occasion was the grand opening of J. Roy's flea market and new and used furniture sign. His other business is had docked. It was Jimmy's last Steve. You must have shot! What's so good about this building is we have a drive-in a wrap where we can hold about 50. Use cars up there in the future plan. We're gonna put a drive-in use car lock plus a drive-in use the new furniture store upstairs The nice thing about it people be able to drive right in get out of their car look at some use cars look at antiques Look at new furniture and look at these furniture and I really believe that this time I Tracon something that people really need that I think will have no problems here making it I believe after that there's some pieces. I really believe the charities that we're here are part of Big Day's My Life. The grand opening of these great boys, late-market athletes, and the new ones. Thanks for the help of us. Don't  we've found the day. Thank you for the help of us. Today, Street Sign, Order of Barron and Braddock App, and the store was located. So rested out in the grand. Jay Royce. Lee Marko, who he used for the teacher, in quite the depth of Jimmy's expectation. I've got everything I have. But my last penny, when I go far or everything else, I've been in this time. I've got everything I've got. Everything I've switched myself out to the last penny. I've been on a brand-new gear. But when I saw, I had the face re-over. The drivers know I'm everyone started to be scared to come to the top. You can't sell people who don't come to the top. So I figured I'm going to get out of there. I can't get out of there. You can open up your body. So, So when you hear it thunder, don't run under the tree. Help me, Pat, let's go have it for you. Amen. I belong with Shakespeare. Nothing is good at bad except thinking makes us up. What is so called words of Jesus, he says, has a man think it in his heart so is he? or something? These days, if you're looking for Jimmy Roy, chances are you'll find him in Plaza Restaurant just over the hill from Braddock. The Plaza is sort of  Jimmy's office. It's located in a 1960 strip mall for his to shop and sing. It's the kind of family place for Bracks and Pies in the glass case by the front door, and where waitressants and their daughters were outside by side. Jimmy Roy sits in a booth in the back of the smoking center. He's dressed in white pador, the white linen jacket. room, silk anchoring. A colorful time with diamond stick and black and white alligator skin shoes. He's wearing five diamond-studded gold necklace, two gold bracelets on each wrist and he has diamond rings on every finger. This is some of the things I've been got when I saw a lot of my hand. This is a little partial minzer pinky ring. It's another partial index ring. It's not the most expensive crystals. is another cluster and this is an envelope. Yeah, that's my store. That's the store I operate my store is no other here, I don't have to pay rent. This kind of change of fortune going from owning virtually half of a brat in the hustling jewelry from the restaurant is the sort of thing that might crush other men, not Jimmy Roy. He's steeled himself against hardship. The philosophy of sales mission is more  a philosophy of life. and we're finding decades. I think it's the night. I question cleaning. I'm something Vincent, 42 years or some study, the night. Right. Is that night? It's the most important thing. Yeah. Right. It's the directiveness. Thinking is a possible for your life. Whether you're going successful, whether you're going to be a baby. To Jimmy, it's all very simple. You tell yourself, who you want to be, what you want to be. And if you do these positive visualizations long. and great things will happen to you. It goes  this. In the morning, early, early, early eyes, we feed yourself, and we don't have such a concentration. These boys, non-resistance, achievement, vitality, strength, life, youth. We feed yourself these thoughts before you leave the house. But how these thoughts are going to matter first. beauty that you receive from planning and great-pops in you. No more than you would be concerned about planning and committed seed. Once you plan it, you unconcerning, , you plan it, you plan it, , you plan it, , you plan it, ,  that you receive your tumiers. To control your thinking, is to control your life, to control your success. I'm one of them. I'm wondering, Suf. His regular customers reach him on the Paz's A phone, and set up a point. Yeah, that'd be fine. What time? Between 10 or 10 will it be fine? Right. I'm glad you've gone. I'm glad you're all right. That's what it works. Jimmy got his start in sales. The age of 22, the use car business. Just home from World War II, he was determined to stay out of the steel mills when he worked in a teenager . We're most of his friends with him. He quit his first sales job after just a week because his dealership was ripping off customers. He's tried to be more honest. He's been a salesman for 54 years. I sweetheart, how you do it? How you do it? How you do it? On the way out of the plaza Jimmy stops to admire a baby. You decide to be in beautiful, how do you feel? You look great. You look great. You look great. You look good. You look  a good girl. The noob salesman. trick. We know the parents by flattering your kids. I'm gonna give her a lucky dollar. Good you think you've been? Of course you think. Did you chew bubblegum? I get a lucky bubblegum. That makes me feel so damn good. Some explain well. I make a baby smile. Makes me feel so great. I'm a step-daughter. Jimmy drives a grade, 1990 Lincoln Town Farm. Load it up with box. is full of bubblegum proof, exactly for moments  this, because of his giveaways. His dashboard is plastered with scraps and paper printed with motivational efforts. You are very fortunate that you have learned that the most certain way to get this to first give. Yeah, choosing to develop an intelligent level of yourself and all of mankind will motivate you to accomplish means above and beyond your expectations. she's mental and physical health and to live a longer life. If you day in every way, I'm getting better and better. And see, all we gotta do is accent the positive. For years, Jimmy Roy has given motivational seminars. He creatures his philosophy of life. Recently about 70 people packed back room in Pazahrestra. Here I'm given the latest version entitled The Secret of Being Rich and Happy. He also gave the seminar to salesmen in Parkway 4. Shoulder just up the road from the crossing. Today, he's back to hand out some cufflinks. That's very Christmas. Thank you sir. I wish you good. And to see how his motivational talk went over. It's very, very, it was a very, very inspirational speech, very, very motivated. Guys, we've rockin' it, but since sales went up. Yeah. I'm glad you're back. Yeah. It's a little hard to tell whether these sales were in our sincere or whether they're just humoring ginger. But... They seem to truly  me and why wouldn't they? The proof is in the numbers. Sales at Parkway Ford did in fact increase by 10% after Jimmy Semner. , what's the thing that he told us? I am peace, I am home, I am goodwill, I am... I am law, I am ordered. Come speak, I am spiritual, I'm vitality, I'm understanding, I'm successful. This work works working, where he comes back and we've pumped up, I'm leaving the house, and we are on it now. to feed the mind, mind, mindlessly, the dynamometer supplies and cars. That's it. The thinking is, the collecting, for sure, that part. You have all these things being directed, and seem positive to fail in our fail. That's right. Naturally, as he leaves Parkway for, there's business to do. One of the car sales he wants to look at an engagement ring. That's a more cute and southern, , surviving, and the rideman. We have them. GEMitars встретlings. because after 54 years as a salesman, it's who he is. He has to sell. When he tried to quit a few years back, he says nearly lost his mind. God seems to be a sure seller. He's even required about it. He seems to be very sincere. I can generally tell this is a slip of the thing that's being that there's only one mind in the universe. His mind and mind, and then, and then, that can't be afraid of how can walk ready in tears. and feel that he's sick. It's a great advantage. Not to be abused. That's a abuse. You say he can act in being alive. Many times. You concentrate hard in being in the country right in there. And feel whether he's telling you the truth or his name. I agree that all of us have that. Very few use it. Jimmy says he'd  to take his seminar Secret of being rich in half. on the road. He's writing a book on the same name though he has no publisher. Of course Jimmy's philosophy hasn't actually made his rich and as I hung around him, I kept trying to figure out a polite way asking about this. Jimmy is a question I've been wanting to ask him about this and bothering him. The name of your seminar, the name of your book will work in the secret of being rich and happy. But with all due respect, not rich. Well, I think I'm one of the richest men in the world. I'm sort of lonely blessed More respects in money. I have money. I have some money. Then I have health and happiness I have things that money can't lie. Why don't you call it the secret being happy? Well, because You're rich when you are happy. Let's we could use that title But as seen the company, we're the secret of becoming rich and happy. Well, I'll take the truth. Another reason why I used the word I'll be working most people desire to be rich so I figured that with some more books would be very honest with you by them seeing how the secret of become rich and happy I've read it as some more books somehow I can't believe it wouldn't want to be more well with one thing oh excuse me I never said I didn't want to first of all I think he misunderstood me I need I  to have enough much I have now to live comparable and to eat good and to have my space to stay and I the money in my pocket, I  to give and I have that. I don't think there's a richer man in the world, my own. As far as I stayed in my space, I believe I have the best state of mind in the universe. My honest and honest opinion. My in-large, Jimmy does seem genuinely happy. Ask anyone in Brad. Still make her Tony Bubba, who's known in just about all this. life says he's never seen Jimmy down. But consider this, a philosophy that's made Jimmy happen. Maybe one of the things that's kept him from being rich. Tony says the reason Jimmy isn't well is because he's too honest. Well I think he doesn't have a fever. Because I think if he had that fever, he had that edge of not really caring about other people. Then he's really pretty. Bye. could have probably been multi-millionaires. I wanted to go the wrong way because I had the opportunity to cheat people on a mobile business in different businesses than I had. But I never would become but I think I'm a very poor, what they call a poor rich man. People might think, no Jimmy Jimmy, but nobody is really, you'll know be a walk away from me and he has a lot of friends and everybody likes. Because he's never cheated everybody. I'm here to talk to you. And I forgot to do the little old man everything. That everyone ought to do. Our final stop is Maurice Lown. And that's... the anal part near downtown Pittsburgh. Jimmy comes here to have a few drinks. They listen to Shirley who's been playing the lap for almost 20 years. And every once in a while, sing a song. You can please be flat chapter of mine number 1, special show of new music videos. The plot Unava does not do very well with the TV series. It's tempting to see sales by Jimmy Roy. It's kind of tragic, really low in care. But here at Morris' Lounge, people recognize Jimmy. They call him Diamond Jim. He chats with Shirley. He chats with the bartender. His philosophy seems to be work. He looks as happy as a man can be. I'm living in the kind of daydream. I'm happy as a kid. That's right. So it makes you feel much better. To me, it's much better. Love me, you're my favorite. And the clock is your voice. You don't have a close answer. That's a great idea in housing. Who's very far to be? And I forget to do the little art and everything that everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of danger.
