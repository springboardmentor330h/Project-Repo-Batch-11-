  "text": "This is what we wish for, and this is what we get. For Susan Bergman, the story went  this. A father led a double life. On the one hand, he proudly described himself as a family man, church organist, in a denomination that was so strict, the women covered their heads, worn their makeup, no dancing, no smoking, no drinking, no going to theaters. This swimming with members of the opposite sex, even. Her father staged managed things, so they appeared to be the perfect, well-huntered, blue-eyed, American family. But secretly, he was having sex with men. By all accounts, there's lots of men. Sometimes, he would even fly off to New York. Go to gay clubs there. In 1983, he was one of the first victims of AIDS. They had barely named the disease. The symptoms weren't familiar. And he died before his children got a chance to ask him about who he really was. And talked to him about how they should reconcile, who yet pretended to be all this years. with who he was. What was real of their child? Susan Bergman wrote a book about a family's experience and underbooked toward a very particular thing started to happen. Amen, who were still married or who had been married, started to contact her. They wanted to explain her father's double life to it. They wanted to explain their own double-gives to her. And they wanted to offer her the conversation that she never got to have with her father. Well, from WB Ezeh and Chicago, it's this American life of my regardless. Back once again for another hour documenting life in the United States. Today's program in. four, acts, act one, gay man, talk to Susan Bergman, a better father, act two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car and in undisclosed location about why he thinks that his children don't need to know the disgag. On why stays married. Act three, we take all the hit. very heavy themes about lying in families from the first two acts and rework them as comedy. You can believe that. Finally, X4 is the sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Stay with us. So be smart. X1. the book tour. Susan Bergman came to our studios, loaded down with evidence. Can they have brought in some tapes of yourself being interviewed on talk radio shows? I've got here and so this first one, do we need to explain it at all before we play it? I think this was a call or that was in some ways typical of the response that I got on. I have a particularly close connection to this sort of thing. I'm a great father, the divorced. And so I'm very close to this. In particular, I can understand your father's secretiveness and his pain. There's always a resemblance that you had to go through the pain, that you had to hide, that you had to lie. And you live with that result, and it really never quite goes away. So it's the same thing. Even in my case, that you completely out and forced the whole bed. The resentment was on that I had to live that life that I had to ride on my wife, that I had to ride on my children, that I had to ride on my family. And never be happy, never, never, never. So happy to... He says, , what was your reaction? So when he was saying this, had to do to her, to be her father would actually be... of the family for the secret that he was keeping from you? ... He was angry at us a lot, but it seemed  it was more... I mean, I interpret that as we were bothering dad, or mom was asking too many questions. Yeah, it's not one that had occurred to me, and I would... have to contest that assumption that one has to lie or one is put in a situation where lying is the only appropriate gesture or response. Let's go back to this table. And I hope that I don't know. Is there anything that I can help? Any questions that I can answer? Because I'm still alive, I've been through. That's great. Boy, I hope I can do this without kind of gushing all over you. It's so great of you to call in. and offer that. Beautiful. I didn't get that. My father. I guess I would ask you. I'm just stopping the tape here. I'm just going to stop the tape here because as you're listening, you're making the gagging signal. The background reaction. Oh, I think that's so great. Oh, I think that's so wonderful. I was not in touch with this full range of the reaction until after I hung up the telephone and stopped the... radio interview. And, , clearly that man was hurting in a lot of ways and the last thing I needed to do was have a fight with him on the air about, , being a liar or whatever, , whatever anger I would have had towards my own father didn't seem to meet to apply to him. He was just something that was in my stand or so. I just tried to be nice and that was kind of me. This is the thing that you wish for and there's the thing you get. And if what you really need is a long talk with your father, , the kind of talk where you get mad and argue and maybe he gets mad and maybe people didn't have stakes and maybe things get resolved or maybe, , they don't get resolved. and you learn that they won't get resolved. But if that conversation is what you need, then no stranger on a radio calling show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. , it's a mockery of what you need. , but there you are, , you're talking to this man, the stranger. And you find yourself asking a version of the question that you would most  to ask your own father. And you get an answer that is totally useless. Because really, it has nothing to do with you. You said you didn't want to share your, quote, real life, maybe. So how do you think, and why do you feel that you were forced to lie about that? How could your family have shared your life? Yes, it probably is wrongly wrong. Once you get trapped into doing the thing, you think you're supposed to do it a young age. I married a 23 because I thought it was I knew I was gay done already. I told him my life for that matter. She put it aside and turned down. Gay men. Senseu's in Bergman's photos of themselves. One happy couple. Stand there in one of the photos and matching sweaters. Raising glasses, smiling. The letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. The letter said Susan Bergman got from the children and spouses of gay fathers. She said, seemed to be written in a completely different language than the letter she got in the gay fathers. It was  two different culture. There are lots of books about men coming out, gay men coming out, gay women coming out. But nobody seemed to be able to remember a book that had been told from the point of view of the children and the wives that these gay men had to cry. And families who were in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. And they contacted her. You brought examples of letters? Yeah, I got, I had the most poignant letter that I got. This woman says she read the book, our lives are so similar, Susan, that it was eerie for me to read. She talks about their background. They were also fundamentalist. Our family wasn't quite fundamentalist, but they were. This woman says Bible believing churches that started in their living room. We... He had six well-behaved talented athletic children in our prosperous and highly visible family. When my dad was diagnosed in 1988, she writes, my mom kicked him out of the house and would have nothing else to do with him. Three of us moved him out of town, encouraged him to change his name and lied about his mysterious disease and our parents' sudden separation. Now they are both gone, and we are left to deal with the fraud that was our life. This is, they had just buried their mother and she was... wrote me this letter. I'm a diet of AIDS because the father didn't protect the mother at all. She says, I'm writing Tinaana to pour out my heart, but to ask if my sisters and I can come take you out for lunch soon there in Chicago. There are not many  us who have suffered such circumstances and I know in my heart that I should be able to hold my head high and talk about my mother's needs and death without shame. But as of now, I can't. That's the end of that letter. I talked to this. family at length, for several different, on several different occasions they did come to Chicago. They did. Yeah. The two of the daughters came. Some of the sons were not willing to even acknowledge that the parents had died of age yet. One of them being a physician. One of the sons things. Yeah. But the interesting story that they have as her father was dying They spent hours and hours interviewing their father on tape about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all the married men that he had been within this three city area. And the addresses in the phone numbers which he had, and they began calling those men's wives on the telephone because they wanted to save lives because they knew their mother was dying. So they would call up these women. say you don't know me but my father has had sex with your husband. Yes. I mean can you imagine that? I mean they of course they debated this among themselves. They thought this is none of our business but when their mother got AIDS they knew that this list of a hundred married men were not taking any precautions with their own wives. And they started calling. And I said, we actually, , I asked them. go on and they said a lot of women hung up the phone on them. And , some would say, oh, thank you very much for calling. But as you say, I mean, the thing that occurs to me is it's such a complicated act because partly it's an act of compassion for somebody and then partly it's such an act of vengeance against somebody else. I mean, I mean, if you lose your mother to it. You can see why you'd be... I can see why. I never had to do that. But I'll tell you, in the town I live in, I'll tell Chicago. There is a family at least one where the same thing is going on. The father is very promiscuous, a prominent man in town, has four young children. His wife has no idea he's a practicing homosexual. They have unprotected sex and people in the community come to me and say, What should we do? We've asked him to tell her. We're thinking about telling her we want to protect her so that her kids have one parent. , I mean, and I, and when I talk to, , and what are you talking to? I say that's their decision. They're going to have to really think about that because I don't know the people. I can't go into their lives just because I wrote some book on the same, , some related subject.... they're involved in the family system in some way. They have to make that decision. I have no idea, but when I talk to, when I talk to gay men about this book, , have read it and when I have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, oh yeah, my main partners are gay, are married men. So well, well, you must, , you have to think about your own responsibility to the family that I am. Imagine. , these different fathers who contacted you did any of them say, I'm sorry. I did something that hurt people and I'm sorry. Well, no. Because there's a lot of talk trying to defend the position that's just newly being articulated in their lives and I understand that they're building their ramparts, don't ever. That position being a, I was... I was right to it, we clear up this. Finally, I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual. That's the right thing. That's being defended in almost all of the letters. Here's a very interesting letter signed anonymously yours. He says, at the risk of intrusion, which is not my intention, I'm compelled to write you an expressed in gentle viewpoints, based on experiences similar to that. in your book, but admittedly, little real knowledge of your life. I appreciate that, acknowledgment, very much. Based on your writing, however, I strongly feel that your father's life with you and your family was not the sham it may superficially appear. I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family and not end up as one of nature's mistakes, which of course he wasn't. Were there no kisses of bruised knees, soothing of— tears and hurt feelings. Ampteen occasions of personal denial, dreams of success and happiness for you and the others, would it be unreasonable to consider yourself doubly loved by a fractured psyche fighting desperately against nature he was given? In retrospect, our not his intense as important as his failures. It's a beautiful letter in some ways. In other ways, there are these irritants in these approaches that I shouldn't be so critical I suppose. But, , it's done to say to me, , was there no kisses of bruised knees? No, yes, of course. , yeah, I had a great daddy in many regards. Yes, he was a split person. And I don't think that he enjoyed being split and neither does this gentleman, but that doesn't make him. better father and that's almost the the thing that this letter is driving towards couldn't you be doubly loved being loved by a homosexual father? no I think I was well loved by my father I think my father was a split person and that that destroyed him and it worked toward the destruction of his family by by coming to understand that you family structure to round a lie that who you were told you were and that the family was has nothing to do with what you really are or or that's very complicated. Susan Burke, a book is called Annenymity. Coming up. A gay father explains why he chooses not to tell his children of his double-vised. Oh, very nice. Oh, thank you. You loved me too. Get up my heart. Then play the part. Oh, little girl. Friends! Okay? Match thee! Shaktif key! the palm I'd see the grain! Ooh! Inspired... уди... Harfin! Thank you. And I'm thinking you But listen to me A big girl had been But we were dead But listen to me This is good fun, but I still change. That I am, how will it hurt? Back to Dad and Coss. This next story is an intended to answer whatever question. Susan Bergman had the better father. It's intended to answer our questions about these gay men who stay in the marriages leading double bars. The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, hence a support group called Review, a men in similar circumstances. He was willing to be interviewed but he didn't want me coming to his home and he didn't want to come to our studios either. On the phone I understood this to me that he didn't feel comfortable appearing in public  this. Later he told me that I had misunderstood. And then in case we went on a parking lot, he's aiming at him. Dr. Quiet Street, where I conducted you in his car. My name is Jerry Walters. No, we each says go, is it okay for us to use your name and we're ready to hear your mouth or something? So it's a name that when I use a work on hotline, they said, pick out your name that you're comfortable with and you say it. So that's what I'm using. Plus it separates business from club and business. So, Jerry Walters. This man is in his 50s, was a teenager during the Eisenhower years. He looked  any suburban dad, who was neatly dressed in grey wool slides, sweater, and what appeared to be a clip on the next time. He says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn't really get angry. He doesn't know how to yell at people. Back in high school he says, he was a kind of boy who got out with girls, but never make passes. All right, graduate, I would date occasionally, and I did find somebody. that seemed  a very nice person that we had a lot of common and we went out of the date. But that afternoon after I met her in the morning and that afternoon I had my first day experience. So it was really kind of a red letter day. I went bowling with her in the evening and I was out with another man that afternoon. So I thought well the situation with the other man was scary and disappointing and painful to say at least. It's not that old-pine that's out of my system. I don't want any more of that. You went on to marry the girl. You used still married to. Nearly three decades later. But soon after the wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. Found himself driving out to the forest for service. For a game end, we know to hang out. Men would walk over to his car. Men would try to talk. And I would try out of the... for his reserve areas  the band out of hell to be perfectly honest and thinking that fine I didn't do anything so there's no reason for me to feel guilty but I would end up with headaches that were so severe that I couldn't work to come home four or five days a week and just be incapacitated with the pain but then I was taking aspirants in Thailand all and everything else I got hooked on tranquilizers and as a scary thing when this obsession first takes hold And we're first you are thinking about it and before  you are completely consumed by the thought of doing something with another male. You're not even sure what you want to do, you're not sure who you want to do it with and where these people are that you are totally consumed with that quest. Well suddenly, my wife became the person that was stopping me from pursuing what I absolutely positively had to do this or by. And you're thinking gets distorted would be an understanding. What happened? What do you expect to think about? Maybe I should say this, maybe it's unique in my situation, but you think, gee, if she had an accident or something, yes, I mean, it sounds bizarre, but you're almost ready to plot the kill, so good. And I told you this. , and it's something that we hear a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody's demise because they're stopping you, and they don't even know what's going on at this point. Do you think that at that time, for you told your wife, do you think that in a day-to-day way you had a lot of resentment that you would act out on your snap or that you would just be sure with it? Because what you're describing is being so resentful. No, I didn't. I held it inside. See this was your wife, you can't do that. I'm one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it aside and you think the top of your head's going to blow off instead. Finally, after two years of marriage, you got up at the courage to tell us why one has sex with men. She says, oh, is that all? And I said, well, you don't understand. , I've got these feelings for men and I don't know how to deal with them. And she says, well, I married all of you. I didn't marry part of you. just figure out how to deal with. And so from there, we just set the guidelines that work for us. I asked her what she needed to be comfortable. She wanted number one to know where I would be. And that's fine. I would soon relieve the phone number underneath the telephone. That if I don't show up by 10 o'clock or 12 o'clock, she calls. She wanted me to be home when kids got home. Or when the kids woke up in the morning. Which is fine. The term. Are you sleeping with somebody I think is kind of stupid? If I'm going to someplace to sleep, I'll sleep at home and I'm going out for sex, not to sleep. So that was never a problem. That's really the only thing. She said I want to be the most important person in life and she always has been chosen. He says of course he uses condoms so it doesn't bring home any infections. Great. Children and people who works with don't know his guy. We have to his father die. Don't this month. Why is Steve? married because I love she loves me. We're probably the best thing that happened to each other ever. See, I don't  there's a difference between gay feelings in living the gay lifestyle. A dramatic difference. And I know a lot of people will disagree with this and maybe take offense at this. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community. There is. and acceptance of lying because it was needed to survive. And honesty is something that I really put a high croissant and I really value it. I suggest to him that he's the one who lies by staying in a straight marriage, not telling his own children he's gay. He says he's not really dying to his children. As he explains that there's no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you're gay. When they're five or ten, they'll make no sense. When he hit out of... lessons could be confusing, kind of burdened as they saw it through their own sexual identities. If his children ask them directly, he says, they're not helped you. And he says, they'll ask when they're ready to hear the answer. If you want to know something, you will ask a question. If you don't ask the question, either  the answer or you don't want to deal with the answer. Am I right? I only you, Chit? They're in the 20s. They're girls. Well, wait, wait. What is your assessment of what's going on? you think that they know but they choose not to ask consciousness. And it's a conscious choice. Yes. I think it's very much conscious choice. I think that they accept me for a while. So when I don't think they want to know a whole lot more about it. But you say they accept you for a while but they don't actually know entirely who you want because you keep a certain question. I am whom my children see. The only thing different about me is that I have sex with men. That is the only difference. If that makes me a different person in their eyes. What value is that? How is that going to make? How is that going to enhance me as a father if suddenly this is in the equation too? I'm a good father, I'm a good husband, I take care of him, I was there when they needed things and the school and growing up and advice and everything. And I don't think that what a person does in their bedroom or someone else's bedroom really is your children's concern. Later in theiconbj... Jerry says that he liked to tell us God is the truth, but his wife doesn't want him to. She doesn't want anybody. He feels he asked to respect her wishes. I asked him if his wife is simply ashamed that other people will know her husband looks for sex outside of the marriage. No, says Jerry. She knows the marriage works for them. Simply doesn't want to have to put up with the opinions people who want to understand. And they do have sex life jerksies. Of sorts. Are you sexually attracted to women as you are to men? No. We don't depend on each other for our sexual satisfaction. I'll find you to go into that, or probably not. My masturbation is something that is part of our, what we do for such a satisfaction. , and how if we do it, it's... It says, does she see it in me? No. She says, that's not right. We talk to each other. two hours, it started to get cold in the car. Over time, as we talked, it became clear that this man stayed in his marriage, partly because he couldn't imagine any other life for himself. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, housing the burbs, couple kids, dinner parties and mortgage payments and knowing the wrong. That was the only way that people lived. I mean, anything else was, I was even considered. And so, how could I be anything other than what I hear? And that was to be a married man. Do you think that you could have a kind of relationship or could you have with your wife, with another man? No. I tell him that these kind of long-term marriage relationships are commonplace. I might gain an eye now. And the suburbs is so commonplace. Let's face it in the city. It's accepted. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands or men can show affection hourly. You will find that the suburbs. It's all right. I think there's a part of you where there's a part of you which doesn't even believe that it exists. It doesn't work, I'm sorry. For a while, I told him about Susan Bergen's book about her difficult it was for her to realize that her father wasn't what he's seen. I suggested to Jerry that his own daughters might feel betrayed,  find it hard to trust her if someday they find out he's been less than candid about his sexuality. He didn't agree. So I take the Easter Bunny and say I'm close. that context too, that your parents told you that this man is Santa Claus. Do you hate your parents or distrust your parents' judgment from that point on? When you are a child, you are given just enough information to live your life. They didn't tell you that the landlord's going to throw you out of the house. They didn't tell you that your father's going to lose his job. They didn't tell you a lot of the things that could hurt you. Because they were your parents. Their job was to protect you. The her situation is that her father was gone. on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a religious man, was a musician in their church. And so there was this constant line. Because it's the lie. He was not all of those things. Wasn't he all of those things, plus one other thing? We are complicated individuals. We can be a lot of things. He said he was a musician, he was a family man, he was a minister. He was a lot of things, and he was just this one more thing that he didn't choose to share with her, and I think that was his privilege. How much do you need to know a person to love them, to live with them? Jerry says he talks to about 260 many years, and the support group he leads for gay and bisexual marriage men. He says he urges men to think very seriously about what we're giving up, if they choose to quit their marriages, if they choose to be honest with you, if they choose to end their Asians in complexchte? He is much in the eyes of the world. He'll never think his theory. Now he is much in the eyes of the world. But he is the world to me. I dare to go. Now he is a man. To me is everything strong, No, he hit the wrong, my dead. I can't now eat, understood. When I bring you troubles to share, all is always there my death. Coming up lies that every parent tells, including a secret that my mom has kept on her kids and yes, it involves sex. Yes, in a minute, when I program continue. To American life, I'm Eric Glass, each week on a program of course we choose theme and by the variety of writers and artists to take a whack at that theme, monologue, stock imagery, short fiction, short radio plays, anything we can think of. Today's program, Double Lives, Heck 3, Light Nop. I hope  we've been hearing about pretty serious lies, total between parents and children. But there are lots of trivial lies in parents' tale. In fact, you can reason we argue that it is impossible to raise children without lying to them. Which brings us to the Neo Futurists. The Neo Futurists are a Chicago group who formed 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. And they prepared this play. They called it a play. I think non-neo Futurists would call it a sketch. They prepared this play on our theme today. It's by Greg Allen, a recent father himself. 21 lies I will tell my children go Number one if you don't get down you're going to break your neck to Santa's coming three mommy was just Singing go back to bed for I will never forget this for as long as I live Five I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you six I said shocks oh shocks seven sure I  your music it's just 8.

Great Galen, Diana Slickman, Dave, all have a rude and David Cadeski, a needle lumus and Stephanie Shaw of the Neofutrous. Our parents can surprise us with what they don't tell us, with what they don't talk about, especially when it comes to sex. Recently, I had this experience, and ex-girlfriend was in the gym looking through a copy of a Marie-Claire magazine, 2019. And there was an article in it on Women's Fantasies, sexual fantasies. What do your man's dirty day dreams reveal about what he wants from you? In the article, six experts, that was where they used sex spurs, reveal the six most common male sex anti-seasonaryos. So my ex-girlfriend is reading, and there in the third paragraph, one of the sex spurs turns out to be my mother. Yeah, it's Ira. Yeah. So I'd  to do a little interview. Okay. Okay. Some kind of read to you a quote from article. Okay. Here it is. Your man wants a woman who excites him through her own excitement. You could stimulate yourself while he watches. Or let him participate by moving his hand to where you want it. Yeah. Yeah. That's you being. in Marie Claire. You're kidding. What is it? All I know is that on the heat was at the gym. And she opens up Marie Claire to an article called Men's Sexual Fantices. And it says at the top here, Sex Birds, revealed the six most common scenarios, and was unwraped the secret longings and secures the modern man fantasized. and you basically are one of the sex birds. Yeah. No, I am. I didn't really know you were a sex bird. What did you think I was? Just another Jewish mom and psychologist. -huh. So it wasn't  you were a sex bird and you were keeping it from your family. , you taught about my family, and my children at my husband. Yeah. Because he knows that I'm a sex bird. Oh my. And you can call him to verify that. I think let that go. But my children always seem embarrassed is I discussed anything, except short. So they're for I and not to around. When would you try to discuss something sexual with us? My, I could tell for... say something that had a sexual connotation in it. It's a brutal. I don't think that that's true. Yeah. Actually, I mean, it doesn't affect me in any way to think that you and dad would be sexual with each other. In fact, I even remember as a teenager understanding that and being kind of reassured by it. Does that make any sense? Nice a little bit of sense, but it really... really does cover all the situations that are not selling a joke or talking about something somebody else. And I think it has to do with boundaries. I think it has to do with that children, even adult children do not  to regard their parents sexuality. Hmm. And this thing you're actually convincing. Okay. Let's do a little scientific. You think of a sexual joke, you just tell one right now and I'll tell you my reaction. I can't think of that. what I'm feeling right now, I'm feeling a repathase. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't even know if it's a joke or a story. Is this something might be true? That when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and he said one giant step for man, or whatever . What's my step for man? and one child, right? One small step for me, and one child, and then he also said, good luck, Mr. Gorky. That's for years, people have been asking him what that man, and he would never tell them. And this year, someone brought it up again, what did you mean when you said good luck, Mr. Gorky, and he said, well, I can tell now because Mr. Gorky died this year. When I was a little boy, Mr. Gorky was our next renabler. And I was playing F-5 one day. and their bedroom window was open. And I heard Mrs. Gorky say, wow, fact, you want me to give you oral sex? You'll get oral sex from me, the day that boy next door walks on the moon. Well, now I'm examining my own feelings, and I have to say, I- did get very nervous there in a way that does not correspond perhaps with shrugging my shoulders the notion of of you having some sexual life and sexual thoughts. Yeah. So let me read you some of your other quotes here. All right. In the fantasy of man dominates woman, you're quoted as saying, says Dr. Glass quote, and a caring relationship it's certainly not abusive or unhealthy the fantasy is played out in a life teasing way. You're So quoted extensively in fantasy number five, spontaneous encounter with a beautiful stranger. The key quote is this one as far as I'm concerned. Go to a restaurant and at first pretend you don't know each other, suggest Dr. Glass. Which whenever that it actually explains some dinners have had with you a dad. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I thought, well  you didn't talk very much between the two of you. And that's just the opposite. So if you actually have you. have you done this? Have you gone to a restaurant with dad and pretended he didn't know each other? No. No. No. But if you did you're saying that you were in the restaurant. We found the restaurant with you and pretended we didn't know you. What do you mean by that? Well when you were younger and and just let you say that, you're mad or refracting didn't you. Yeah. We conformed. All right. All right. I think everybody. Yeah. That's not it. Back when Daddy would look at you and he would start popping and show you so. We go out to Eve and I say now, Barry, people are looking him and we're going to look at us. And they're going to know that we're not taking out as close. So now that I know that you're the big sex expert, do you have any sex advice for me? Find a nice girl and get married. That's not sex advice. We always end up. This way, that way. With that particular advice. Yeah, that's the thing. No. I could ask you any question. And that would be the advice. Well, that was the first rule of journalism. New taught thing. This what? No matter what they ask you, should we get your point in. You're when you were first being interviewed by people. This is what I told you, say. Well, I'm glad I'm going to do that. I'm glad we got to that, man. My mom, Dr. Shirley Glass, in Baltimore. Are you here? Burning eggs or sweet potatoes? starting to peel cucumbers Tell me lies, tell me lies as we dance, I'm a pie's And the girl lips have never told A whip, a youth might have lived with your eyes. Ooh! Tell me on this marvelous And generate Revero games If you must Just Talk to me baby Salt alone And then leave you I'm excited, really so This is where you been mine forever On the one I got not to be here Demin' lies lies lies lies I'm drunk, meet mutable One of you, mutable lies lies lies I'm a great big big big new woman! I've fought since the fathers. What does it do to children if parents tell a big lie for years? Part of Susan Bergman's book and an enmity is her trying to understand the two parts of her father. The district would be just family now. excausd. a night cover. His personality was split in half, she writes, and the two irrecuit soluble hairs. But part of her book is about her discovery that growing up in his home, she became somebody who was also split in half. Somebody able to carry on a life with two irrecuit soluble parts. She found herself a son and adult, leading a double life. And her program, we asked her to read them. I pretend. I am a faithful wife. My husband is married to that faithful woman. The woman looks  me. She moves around in my body. This is what I mean you can't tell by looking. He makes love to her. He has asked her a question once or twice, and she has heard herself reply with an avoidance. Is there anything you haven't told me? I want to know more of you Susan. He spent last evening on opposite ends. of the house keeping things going, changing the music, refreshing people's drinks and trays of food. What makes you ask that tonight after such a great party? All our friends here, scrumptious food, didn't you enjoy yourself? She unfastens her gold, beat a bracelet and fold it carefully into its silk-lined box, replacing the lid. I saw the way Tom looked at you. There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about the tonight. me and anyone here tonight, most definitely nothing's up with Tom. She concentrates on slowing down, as she hangs up her belt, and tosses her stockings in a basket of hand washing. We're doing this jealous thing again. What kind of luck? Do you have any secrets from me? A few? She'll keep it , this is not my natural hair color quite, but the rest is real. You must understand that lying is a temporal and visibility. It's the leaves you wrap yourself in when the voice in the garden calls. I was learning to deflect any doubt or question about my faith on this, back onto the questioner, so that I didn't have to perpetuate the lie. I had for years part-wide, but mostly told. true. Two and more irreconcilable parts, which let me understand my father, or made me into him. Here was my father's ailment again. His dread of being known. There's a family with children on the line. I forced my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed no matter how we strove or blessing to discover the root of our calamity. I can't shake his choice alone, I tell him I saw. So we slipped in fell, which is human, and he died stuck. And this glowy lie I keep perpetuating sticks to me  a curse, revisited, on the next generation. My father is in the window when I glance up, and in the hurried tone of my voice, in the shape of my ribs. What if,  John, as is, he had asked us to lock him. I opened the book I had slipped into my jacket pocket and read. Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. a send into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in his holy place. He that hath clean hands in a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, who was sworn to seek for. If her hands are clean in her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me, to cancel my own going lie. My main taining the family pattern, caring feelings. My husband couldn't bear ever to look at me again. Hadn't my family put him through enough already? Wasn't Daya hard pill he had to swallow and swallow? He would remarry within the year, a woman of fidelity and beauty, and away with children, my children. What kinds of stories would they be told about me? All that we had made together, we took in the joy. Did not add up to the ultimate ban? to the untruthful, from the presence of God. If you give me the opportunity, Lord, one more time, whatever the consequence I pray. I will tell the truth. Judges and put the questions simply, the same one as before. That morning, I had sat in the sun and read and drunk my coffee uninterrupted. Maybe it was a morning unlike any of my thoughts. had ever been given. When Judson came home later that morning as when he asked, is there something you'd  to tell me? There was a reason my husband was unable to retire his doubts. I had made an offer of honesty, yes, but hadn't thought the test would come so soon. Walking out on the plank of my own promise, I peer down at the water. First, you leave your father's house and then your own. There were the deep golf below me I could not see into. This was the last of my life as I knew it. Whatever the consequence I said inside my head to remind myself, breathing once. He could tell in the stillness of the pause between his question and my looking back of it, him. That his life was changing, too. This lady is interrupting you normally and she plays style together. Eat leeeeep! Go back, it's someone else to make my heart And be my life, and I'll you see,  that Ooh, oh man, you're wrong Me, still with me, oh man Me, oh man, you're wrong Yeah! Oh, how?
