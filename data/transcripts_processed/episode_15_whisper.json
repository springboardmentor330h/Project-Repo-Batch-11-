  "text": "From PRI Public Radio International. From PRI Public Radio Public Radio Public Radio Public Radio International. From WB-easy. Today it's a American life. Marcones. I'm going to tell you first today about Mr. Louis. And I call them Mr. Louis because although I have asked it, what does first name? And I found out that they were good journalists. And they're actually really good. this first. So it seems kind of wrong to me. This is the kind of man who has a certain phone. And if you visit the school where he works, James McCash Elementary, and Chicago Southside, you can hear what that effect here. And how are we? Mr. Lewis helps the kids convert to field house, sat on the school's parking lot, into a two room haunted house. It's a go-bye. a budget handmade affair, but done so effectively that when the kindergarten first grade and second grade says walk in, they panic with the kind of panic that makes them drop things, that makes them scream and not stops. They do not notice that two monsters, riding on top of open grays are really just two six-grades, lying on top of fairly disguised poop-eye tables. They do not catch that the undead are wearing Nike cross trainers, but it's sometimes the monster's square of that. Yellow Street-19's connections. I'm flopping out. I want your brain! I want your brain! I'm okay! This sixth grader extends your arms, since when two kids running in the other direction. The older kids played it hard to prepare a standard. So happy that can't help grinning here, a moment's when the stress gets scary. Oh! Big guy! Come on! Hey, all the truth! Mr. Muffins! Into the fray, in baseball cap and yellow jacket. Walks Mr. Lewis. In theory he's schooled this panaria, but his reign is one of love or fear. Three or four small children grip onto each of his hands and he walks and pass the ping pong table of terror telling the me never got anything bad happened any now. Until suddenly they bolt for the door. My good left, hey, I'm on Mr. Lewis's ear! Come on ... Oh with kiss and ten. Crats then after a while and the girls on the paint club table consent to an interview. One of them is holding for it in pieces that sure a person could look at their outfits is striper of regers or you could choose to see them as pirate costumes. On the other hand, volunteers without any contact, this. This looks  a public holiday and they're constantly being made to be with the whole everyday. He makes us so good. You never was saying, , , most popular is that once it is good and he does know us. We say it's not as good as the fact of the crowning. You play  jokes about the fact of the crowning. It's tell me about the favorite activities of the past. The student leaders of tomorrow club, the peer leadership workshop, cheerleader. Mr. Lewis is a big part of all these. It's Mr. Lewis who made the turn start in the full punk table the read. Alright, here, positive death, Jim. It's Mr. Lewis who mediates the fights. It's Mr. Lewis who really knows. I'm on the after I record this tape, a childhood shot. After school, on the parking lot, he starts out to hide the skirt, just a few yards from the ping pong tape on the scrolls sit on. The cost sits in the neighborhood that has all the problems of any of us. And it's easy to see why the students have the cost. They need someone  Mr. Lewis so bad. And it's easy to imagine these girls. That gets me now. Remembering this to work. Hawking, wondering what became all of us has certain figures from a childhood to a seem a kind of mythic status, right, I'm really remembering. Sometimes the people who have loved us, sometimes they're more disturbing figures. Well, today we've devoted much first show to a story about a man, not only had one of these legendary figures in the chocolate, but he decided recently he was going to track down the way it's kind of art, epic story. It is a story of the old South, the New South, which was high society manners, homosexuals, and some teachings and nothing to do with it. Stay with me. And listen to the L.C.s violin on the funk. You sound me swear to never pass a sound as a funk. So listen to the way that we're on and on the funk. Okay, I'm gonna begin things with this. song about respecting those who came before you and influence you. As you question that you love listening I know huh Yeah, I did name the Ronald phone We got really started the call that because We know the beats funky and everything But it's too slow to listen It goes beyond it But the beats funky but we wanted to let people know The real funk came from me and me funk As in funk and beats we went funk As in the funk vibe funk vibe So it's all about them Tell us a funk vibe What's the funk vibe? No, I know how to listen Sometimes you listen all the new deputies who's doing the driving snout  the race Ma the boss while the P&D got destroyed. They're dropping all the high news stuff to hip-hop stuff. The fuck mine was the old-put guy, she'd prove they knew I'm safe. The fuck mine is calling me, so I could be yelling by the fucking sky. Fred Westman, the morning horns, George Clinton, boom, sink, hollies. what I'm saying? That's how I know. I know all the brothers man. they  the ground when I have to go to get that out. The truth is, lets States around the whole life. I'm not from that time period. So what? You're gonna have a day off. You don't have to be from that time period. Understand it. So I'm saying, that is all that. what I'm saying? Not just me, deep, empty. I know the fuck, man. Not just me, dude. Oh, man. But that's what it is. He's the other one. Not the man. You ain't the right man. That's the most... I'm just... I'm just... I know you said it's my first time. You said it's my first time. You said it's my first time. I'm just... At one, so many stories about childhood are set at the first moment of adolescence. That moment when we first try to cope with you, you get nauseating fact. So what is going to be  for us as adults? Sixth grain. This is where Jack hits story and his search begins. Quick warning before we start, parts of this story might not be suitable for a game of this story. Close paper, have a fun day. story about finding out what babies come from. I've got one. My friend Parker Coleman told me about it. Blue plane in his backyard is a different time in place that being in 1967 and Charleston South Carolina. Until then I knew about the sex act only from Cusswords. In my mind it was Dorothy, Nasty, certain forbidden. From the air I had picked up the onion and sex with something black fromsted, maybe whites were not the right and breeding. Officer reasons. really in a sex. Be as long as I've seen this learn as true. But when Parker told me that babies in sex were connected, my sister dying was pregnant for the first time. So I punched them in the face, hopped in my bicycle, and sped on home. But this rather standard tail of sexual awakening occurs within a larger story, for me, a much larger story. See, in my neighborhood, we live down the street from a British writer named Gordon Moyni-All, a slim man who preferred both dogs. I remember hearing one day that Gordon had left for a distant hospital, John's toppings, and returned fully retonstitated as a woman who now preferred to be known as Dawn Pippita Langan Hall. My new neighbor favored Jackie Kennedy dresses in toolbox hats. Her hair was grown out until it curled at the collar, in the fashion of that time. She wore lipstick, and modest 60s buzzed in her beard. Not long after her operations. She announced her engagement to a handsome shrimp-er named John Paul Simuse. John Paul also worked as Don's Butler. And John Paul was also black. I'm remembering that Don's adopted mother, the British film actress, Dame Margaret Rutherford, was quoted to the effect that she didn't mind going to change in his sex, or Gordon marrying a man of another race, or Gordon marrying into a lower station, but she did wish that the young man was not Baptist. Such anecdotes never seem to cease, especially a... after dawn announced that she was pregnant by John Paul. I can never receive her a lot during this period, walking down the street, heavy with child. Everyone said it was a pillow on her dress. The town began to freak and properly did so, and she returned from the secret birthing. It was an Inwa. It's a beautiful Malato name. Well, that was the last straw for Jost. Unseen pressures were applied in one day I heard that the house was sold. Almost overnight. Dawn disappeared, and almost as quickly it came a bizarre, gathic yarn I told to stun audiences. But over the years, even I know I'm going to believe the story, which is quit telling it. Eventually, one sister here about Dawn doll. Now, around the time she announced her marriage, I remember being sent to my brother's room. Bobby, who was 17, was given the task of setting a straight on the facts of life. Given what was going on down the street, Bobby had a lot of it. around the cover. I remember he confirmed Parker Coleman's story. Then by way bridging his material to Dawn, he told me what homosexuals were and what they did. Then he told me about transsexuals with complete details on cutting it to penis and surgically fashioning it in vagina. I was 10. Part of what I remember that year, is that the media arrived every time it was a new outrage in the ongoing Dawn saga. And that the story with national many times in the next few years. I can remember. sneaking down in the house trying to catch a peep of anything for the Ronaldin gates. Dawn. She became my own boo-radly, a sexual parable, designed co-on of the bizarre. For me, the mystery of sex still hasn't overwrought tabloid grandeur to it. Almost three decades have passed,  I said, have come to doubt the entire dawn in a big cycle. I knew there had to be some truth to it, but I also know the childhood memory isn't. that, snagging and shaping every little fact and rumor into the stuff of symbolic language. I assumed that there is a little nugget of truth and dawn, and I wanted to find out what it was. So, I ran back to Mom. She's lived in Charleston, all her life. It reports to my stay one afternoon, who sat at her dining table. When Gordon was still a guy, he was... He happened to say, hey. That's my mom, whispering. He can't really hear. What she's saying is, and you say that... on the radio? Here listen to me. When Gordon was still a guy, , do  what happened to him? , when Gordon was still a guy, see, good job Stoney has done up to Scott's private affairs openly. If at all, you'll discuss them so don't you? Sometimes literally in this part. This impulse is compounded by the fact that Don's story is so over the top that my mom can't really talk about, even still. on calendar. be considered seriously, Don cannot even be considered. The very question is possible. I never thought that I never knew. We never had a long time. I didn't even know I was baked up. I'm sorry. I can't get wrong here. I don't know. As we talked, she was pretty many a number of times. She really has nothing to say. We're rather not talking about it. We decided to turn off the table. So I tried to change a subject to the neighborhood we shared with Don as it's part of the story. In the mid-60s, Daddy had moved the family out of the historic park downtown Charleston, a white neighborhood, into an uptown slum called Anson Barra, predominantly black. The few whites in the area were mainly homeless sexuals with me there as we did, to buy an anti-bellum home for cheap and fix it up. In this context, Gordon was just one of what was known as the confirmed bachelor's in the hood. It was simply black. I've been written a couple of things that were very rare. I don't know that it was written at nice real papers. And the people mostly that entertained them were, we did get socialized a little bit, just right as well. And a few of the dowages so they speak really hard in the time of that year. They liked it. And then, because later when they found out, that's interesting. And we'll tell him our first. But he was a kind of semi-sensei shit for a while. No, no, no. No, what made him sensational was that he was a writer or that he was a fun boy. No, he was very different in any act of. I mean, the people understand that he was possible. No, I'm a sexual. No, I don't think that this was the beginning of a lot of people that come to the child. Not that I'm the guy who's a lot of tocho. After 45 minutes of teadrinking and considering the cultural contributions of homosexuals. No, I don't think that's the same as homosexuals. Mom did remember one story. It was not about race or class from Jennifer on the search sex But  every doing account, it was gothic, almost supernatural, concerned on your storage mansion. When a friend of the sisters thought that had, it was still odd. And it's not  what? Well, it was put. But for a masters account they had time of making. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Everything has to be sanded and scoured and all on there. That's right. A pig. See, that's how dawn stories can be done. Anyway, mom did something that can't one point in detail. And done for us. Yeah, passing by on a certain number. We look at it. And we're trying to almost be scared,  that. See? We again can't keep him ever heard of pure troughs from the accent that's piercing brown eyes. I remember their haunting quality too. And as I talked to people in town, both on and off the ring is, it was all remembered non-the-percee. Otherwise the Taylor sounded  an emerging mythology, clothing with animals, medicinal stale, dawn, a Charleston legend. For most of my adult life, especially as I became a reporter, I've also seen the story psychos in Parabolic World was a glass thing to be known fashion media that struck it not that what scandalous claims dictate the universe. In my own personal history, Don was the first learning of vomit, to an arting human better future. I only mentioned this because my father is the editor of the Indian prophecy, and he never ran single on one. about the non-same. He thought it was all a publicity stunt to sell wooden street food books that had titles  Golden Boats to Burma. My father died before the wedding, but even afterwards the local government received a dance wedding announcement appeared as a fuller on the obituent page. Meanwhile, this was a national story in the tab that was an optimization. Music explained to the full page spread, known as wedding, complete with controversial photos of the intracial couple. The New York Daily Newsman soon crashed. in his life. Troph, the strange infection, said their first story on the Nuffins. In another edition, there is a first person accounting wedding. He knew he did. Dawn Pepe to Hall, a British born male before a sex change operation was on Togor, changed her name tonight, marrying the former Butler in Negro. Wearing a full length white yarn, the Trophet train, the thin brown herds all into the wedding in her sleep. were Charles's invention to the strains of the battlehen of the Republic, and was married to John Paul Simmons 30. 25. Guest in the handful of newsmen witnessed the 2018 ceremony performed by the Reverend William Singleton in Negro who appeared in the days. That might be my favorite sentence in the non-gabbage, although this one also from the same tabloid as close. quote, Miss Hall said the news had not been received to join following Charles's top design in which golden line. all man once moved freely. The right of the sentence is it turns out is an old famous friend, Jack Newell. He worked for my dad as a writer on the paper, but given the local embargo and being not full, Jack started stringing for the Indian News. Jack is now the town elder in Charleston, famous storyteller in the far end. Everyone knows him and anyone who writes about Charleston was sitting in an audience room for him. When Vias and I Paul were just a book, the turning of the South, the intern in Charleston chapters basically along then. and wait at the main constitution of what's Jack and I. These days, Jack is probably walking. He's living in this daughter Chibis, we outside of town in the spirit of land in the woods. Chibis is in the house provided by post hurricane Hugo funds. Her stunning view is passed to yard from the boats. The obligatory Spanish moss snagging in the bridge. And then a small creek, and vista, brown green marsh grass out in the horizon. Jack spends his morning with me tentative and quiet in the city of New York. So I start by. He came down there with a very good recommendation. He knew the property for the New York and he had written the book and he had an English accent. That was enough to make the darling of Charleston Society for a while until they found out he was a homosexual. Then they dropped him because of that time being the homosexual was exactly  a child. I thought, I'm done. I forgot to ask Jack and the King proper people who was in control of them. Anyway, Jack is the only person I know who attended the famous wedding of Donald Han, John Paul Sims, at the house on 56th of Cyberspace. It was a force. They were all gathered in the living room, the big living room. There was a group of people in there. The bride was in prison. They have a big room, a minister who couldn't leave. the prayer book properly and they had a makeshift altar in front of the fire place and when there was a TV station there,  when they tried to party came down the stairs to the tomb of the back of the human Republic which I thought was beginning in the first moment. They came and they were very wrong and we just stopped with the meat. and have his back to the camera. So he made the creature turn around and face you. Put his back to the camera and let him face the audience. There were two little babies talking the train, or we had a regular wedding gown on with a man teller on his head on over a wing. And the train was attached to the man teller on some way. Those two lungs. después and they went to swing around, we were swinging in the wide circle and almost pull this head rig roll. And what happened after the bounce work team, we there for the reception? It was a blank bang and say, I was in a lot of people all over the world, black, very much, all black, just a few whites. Who was there? Well, I can't remember the names now, but there was two with us. working mean, for it should business, not business, generally effective dumb, whom was such it? The furniture business attracted homosexuals, and jealous to the good they had to pay him. Ah right. Turns out Jack was right about homosexuals in the late 1960s, and in the 1960s there was a well-known, though, never-the-minute, gay aristocracy in Charleston, centered in part on the late 1960s, and located in my neighborhood. One of those men is Jerry Mah, who's still with. him friend. He spent a lot of time together when I was a little. I can remember his boy climbing through a dense garden down the street, up behind Walt getting onto his balcony, hanging around and cracked jokes and gossiping with Jane the Silicory's friends. I don't think I ever walked through his friend door. I thought maybe Jane would remember not, maybe even Gordon, and who they were. So I called him up and hung one afternoon, picked me up in his convertible. As it's still the custom and sharp thing, despite all the mall outrage elsewhere, sometimes we fail and just fall aflo dotted withhto to not working outrage because that's the thing. We get all my plans away from my friends and hang out with It fixed ourselves with a known mobilized travelers Granks that in case the vice-squad is listening, we'll describe his cook-holness You drove up town to answer bar And that's where you lived. Yeah, that's where you live. I remember he's the time in the same You came window we got to see that gate because you're thinking is that wall jack when I think about that wall was  18c high There's monkey blood in the young He's got to be the scale of wall because of the and the trees were  20 feet tall as they were. Took the house where I took it, just because he trusted me. And I say I dislike the gone of creations of Astya's garden. You'll know that when you hit the back. But as I say, to scale that wall, what have been a feed, I think, even for nine years old, you want to do it. I think this is how starved I was because you're a jack. It's been so long since both of us were in this part of the house. You can trim a locating town, it's been from this house. Which one was her house? Is it this one? No, no, no, no, no. It's this one I've here. It's up here, the lot here. Right. That's the famous porch. What's famous about the porch? the writing is held, and the music was done by, I believe that one called Victor Locks. Hahaha. Well, no, an orchestra of course. Who played Who knows? Combination of rap, Japanese, and... odd music and Spirituals I have no words God it was all that poor chance and they go out and that's where Where did  I'm a car jay I'm saying I'm doing a story about gay culture I said I'm doing a story about my coming of age and ins and I'm in Donne the truth is I've known Jay online life We have never discussed a section of our intention because people in Charleston's  reason in this case It's with my mom so with me and even What would it have been  for a well for some of all I'm asking that so are you gay? Some never asked you that well, let's put it since the way I'm saying that I have public Such a great channel soon answer indirect funny new bad words still Jake can be wicked is when he told me about calling his old roommate for these days But I was talking to Eddie I said to him Jack is doing the story of an answer for a party sexual I didn't sleep with Jack at I. He might not as gonna love that guy. She said, Just Jane, I drove her in room in a scene. He told me his version of Gordon's fall from the race. Now, all my life I heard in Gordon was asked for so much right after the sex change operation became humblest. The Jack we needed said the city shunned him even before that, when they learned to his own sexual. Now, J. remembers a slightly more strapping education. She had her dogs. Look at the baby. including wearing real-pulsive poems. Get out of him, Mr. Sory. What's this story? What happened? Even in the paper of these. And I ducked. This was when he was still going right on me. So this is prior to the sex change in prior to the marring of breaking rules even back when him. This is what I mean when done. Everyone has a story. And here it is 30 years after her sex change operation, you're still hearing fresh wounds. In a safe manner ofiction destined for Sana. lying at all. Later during my stay, I was at a conto party with a neutral stone in it. The dog story would come up from time to time and always slightly different. You want to keep it cruise, maddening, and another is great. Dane, and St. Lydman, and every team are already. But as I moved among the different sub-feltures in Charleston, these stories provided me with another incident in our. She was a scandal not only for street Charleston and it's, but for the gay aristocracy as well. Two groups that were often hard to distinguish in this case. The whole thing was you had enough. So this group I'm talking about who I am, well all now even. Most of them, I would say at this point, all of them I think of one of them, who did not achieve them. But I would know this children, who went to school, I would know all this, and with more of this children. I think actually, Charles has been of almost hand over change, even the black husband to some extent, all of that into. It would have been she had taken the normal medicine. What is it? Are you talking about the gay culture or the culture? Gay culture who was basically smoked. Right. It's an hour you'd get to try. And I do believe that it's not been the one who has stayed at some point. The one who was a band. But there was one who was a gay culture of Charleston, Charleston felt it's screams. The way Jay described it, Don represents the thing that God would do. the wind, closing the entire front of his crab. They're private, swimming, Charleston life, married, but ganged with children. They'd soon end in a noise and media service of Don Ling and Hall. So the homosexual culture really didn't know Don either, although Jay had one dream, Don sort of  my mom's. It was a misty evening. When he and a friend who passed her on the street, she shot and he will look from his piercing neurons. Very foggy night. , whole thing is perfect, , but a scene in Don. We even passed on walking the door was and we could go two or three steps and suddenly all the lines in the end of the room We're not going to remove the string lines and cross lines and then we're all right to my hands I think they were all about 30 or 40 minutes we took it from the beginning because we got candles and things and barred you with the door But again dawn was supposed to hand some sort of house That was that was it No, no one part of the story, the voodoo she might have had was learned from her husband, right? Well, that was the other story, my natural body, not black. More, yes, back when I'm good at being a little similar to the teacher you do. See you later. writing a game. Her brother-in-law and I spent an afternoon we often get hang-in-love stars. One called Keating Honor, I turned it onto a shelf and there was dawn in the hall. It was the latter room, but that was a wedding picture, a beautiful young John Paul Simmons on her side. The title could not have been wrapped, dawn, a Charleston legend. She had written it herself and he did just come out. I picked up the book and stared at it and comforted him so much. I hadn't seen one through years. That person used to live here, so far. I know people who knew her. It just bought my copy in the room. The writing in this book is sugary, full of Romanian images, blissful, denmised, big, fabulous,  gestures. Dawn drops names and Florida efforts into the banding. First line of the book reads, My good friend, novelist, Rita Mebron, so app was said. If you take a man to Charleston and in three days, it is not proposed. throw him in the crate bottle. But my biggest escape was the office Banyo. I learned that Don and I remain neighbors. She lives in Hudson, New York, not far down the road from where I need love. So I called her up. I didn't tell her immediately I was in Charleston and just that I would  to interview her from the media. She said she'd be delighted. A few days later I received a flight note banged out on an old standard deep writer. Moving here. Dear Mr. Hit, I look forward to seeing you on Sunday. I'm disabled now since the food can accident. The doctor said I remember walking in, but I am doing so quite well. I'm in the middle, moving into a 10-hospital room. I've lived in this rundown old house for five years, because it was the only place I can find for my dog and the walk. After 10 years, we have my husband home from the middle hospital. It's not easy to hear the voices, and sometimes talks, shouting home. So many people do not understand what real sickness can do with family and business. The letter is signed by the formula with all good wishes, your sincere right, don't learn this in it. Coming up, Jack Hitz visit, don't learn this in it. It's in a minute, public radio and international, went out program for the news. It's this American life, am I a class? The deeper Jack Hitz does. into the mystery of Gordon Lime of Hall. He-he-he, John Lime of Hall, he-he-he, John Lime of Simmons. The more questions opened up, take example this fairly straightforward clipping from New York Datingons, by the 21st 1968, aged 4. It announces that Gordon Lime of Hall, by a refer to Jackie O'Nassus and Mrs. Windenjons, has changed his sex. And then a little ways into the circle, it goes to quote from the Huff. the crossbow of the clonth must be early 16 collaborations. We're fine. In this case, quote, the Baltimore Agents have been spokesman said, in response to a prairie, this harvest patient, this hall underwent surgery. The good night coming for the day. In Jackie Chan will met, even the nature of this surgery. We're so excited. On a rainy cold morning at bulletin house, the only one. when they were in the street, she had told me. The image I had was of mention,  in Charleston, it turns out her houses in the train station, and they can straighten the neglected warehouses. Even in the morning, bar down the way in the zone, it heard door of the ground being this peeled and cracked in the floor yard felt banked, walls were missing chunks of plaster, and dead vacuum clean, pure chuck on a heaping track. The wooden balustrade lit up the stairs for down here in the hallway. She was small, dressed in a red smock and purple leggings. Her gray hair was dying red and three inching point loops. She looked  an old lady, completed the haunchers home. He's nowhere to be seen brown eyes and could not change in 90 years. Friend of the phone. Good morning, delighted. Inside her house, the four dogs and five cats racing up and down the wine, my central one once. mostly the walls in scratch though, slight room with ancient England with the theme. A few of you can take the native song or acquisition along the walls above your tongue and down on the footer after the end. As I set up my equipment, a large black man feared in the doorway, and just as he knew it was. The quickly-fosed saloon's mouse from the indoors and the lamp can do a heap of blankets on the bed. From time to time, I would even be soft as soon as I knew it. Although I did not seem to jump off-press. and it's never more fun. Donna Polygna is from Hong, she's actually a steep. She's slumped in a chair and jumped in me, adjusted in her ass, and began to move. I was going in a country village, and in more country mid-watt, and when I was low on the, the tutorials were so small, we can try to tell it about me, by the lawyer and girl. And the lower an England was the fact that time, the very cool law which instantly was changed from my case. The lower an England that time was that when in doubt the chart is just automatically written, but with our results. Now today, if that happened, maybe it's immediately changed in the past, though, not just a little so great and everything is but right. In my case, but, and it was very difficult when I looked  a little girl. Then when my menstruation started, it was irregular in that, but it was very frightening. So, if you were here, it was the most fundamental fact in Don's List, and her version is totally different from what I heard, that there was no sex change in her version, that she was always a woman, forced to live as a man. Then she told me that she grew up with a father, who wasn't her words, the fact totem, and chauffeur, at writer Vita Sackville West's famous estate and was missing just, living there. sometimes soft-age and wolf in other literature. Then, as the Ingordon, she moved to America right from his own newspaper. But for dawn, every aspect of her life is a kind of gorgeous acid. Every anecdote is a silent movie, Glynges Studio. The footage should be punctuated with great garb of sweeping into the striking pose near piano. My first job was as a society editor in the Nevada, Missouri, and It was played after all the national press that I was the first myelma society editor in the state of Missouri and all I could say is Well, I only knew when I first decided to explore the non-cycle I wanted to discover the true story as a person assuming it would be so much simpler than all the embroidered room My call just tells you all about myth Voting the email on his Instead, Dawn's version tried to be more fantastic than anything which I also mentioned. One story for example featured in Mafia, a vengeful ex-lover, Tuchihuahua's, itman, Melinda Mossert, and the Elvis-Bashingographer Albert Goldman, who once mentioned Don in an escort article. And he said that Don Lanyseman's head to Tuchihuahua, surprised my secret way. I didn't have to, Tuchihuahua was surprised my way. My little maid was married in the house and she... up to the wall and she brought them down for her wedding on a cushion and this was a story. So I called Dean of Crane who was my, , meteor agent on the dinner you call that Albert Bellman and you tell him I'm so many people in the million. , if he doesn't train to retraction, I didn't have to do all this, it's my way. And so he called happened during dinner and he said, you tell him that, , if, She doesn't sue me, Art Haller, who tried to have her killed in Charleston and worked comfortable at the summer, and he did. He was investigating the role of the Matio her play in the drug trafficking. They used the inland war-horrorized soapball and the lonely plantation, and he was told the story in the bar. Apparently, this group of I don't know if she couldPl Have a Nutella,红 fragrances but I've seen a doctor that was what they fought in that number, and they coworkers with roughly a Chas... and so saw the people laid for this former lover. I had put a contract on my life. And it was that night I was alone in the house and the tassel was then being born, my daughter. And I heard a crack up stairs and I thought the baby'd form it in the pot. Around upstairs and there was a man standing out of her own ski mask, white man, holding a knife over the bat. But my now as he couldn't with arm, never been. I've been using pop music since and broke up my big toe being me up and it was the right thing and then he threw me off and I was fortunate to land on a lamp and sat and come with blood. I called in the house and let actually happen I was very glad to know and but now going back to it. I have to say how strange it was to be sitting there talking to Don Lining Hall. All my life she was a distant figure. Even when she was the man or lady walking across the street, she was mainly myth. Seeing her in her house was  sitting next to Hera, wife of Zeus. And the odd thing about her radio interview is you have to hold the microphone right in your person's face. I was probably 12 inches from her. Weird zoning in his ear. You can see her pores. You can see the three old lady house above her level. The lines in her face. I set off on this journey to separate known person from all the stories. The long-live is sitting there talking to her. The inner house. I realized I've always wanted to just look at her. The way a 10-year-old boy wants to look at anything new and different. With a contract, where people make it through a window, or a dead animal, or a greenhouse fire, or a transactional. When I came home that night, my wife and her sat in into exchange accounts. her back. Both of us had amazing stories to tell. This is a med student and she told me that in the hospital that very day she assisted with an operation on a new one girl. The reflection is called virulosimition. In the symptoms are adrenal and remuneration that causes the clitoris to expand to the signs of the typical thought and look  a piece. At the same time, the vaginal lips are fused and swell into what it's  in the screen. days it is easy to correct in a simple operation. So what if it were all in true? The dawn is born in the world, the wrongly exact station falling. So that her life, her awakening, her metamorphosis, even her child, all of that could be myologically possible. Imagine, if the hysteria and outrage degenerated in time, dawn, epic cycle, just boil down to all of us for a long time. I couldn't lose the rangatains of something in front of me. Imagine. But I'll be honest, I've told myself this to me so many times. I cannot imagine. But donk. I had a recurring dream in which I saw an old fashioned glass Harris with blooms, turned and going to the cemetery. And in the casket was golden. And that was it. and recuring dreams. And of course I grew up in a system first. And the jediah wall for drittin' or land , the one who saw about her friend and love her videos that were west, how over the years, , our land were turned from a different young man into a woman. And so, , I see all that, I, I thought in my heart that I was the, , the living ner etc. So, here's Domine Meem ஓ, the living Orlando. And yet all the outlander stories in life are contained within an unexpected consumer for propogny. She married once from 1969. And long after the publicity faded, she stood with her men for madness and poverty. She never divorced or remarried, acclaimed New Gingrich and Reshilunbach for not making. She notes on her daughter Natasha reports to her peer and his son named Christopus Global Church in Hudson with her two grand. and shivering tone . when you look at the pictures of Gordon, he was dapper always in the coat and tie, and he was sharp looking, , very hip, , a young writer guy, and yet dawn turns into this rather, , almost frumpy, white,  mom. I mean, what's that about? I want to be white more than anything. No, you're absolutely, you're absolutely great. I don't miss proper, and don't miss. same with that man, England, time to Charles and Susana, he's also a favorite I identified it. I've always put music first because that was what I was holding up. when I was reading your book, you mentioned that your father was in the can of your mother, this was, I guess this was an illegitimate birth, right? She was 15, she was 15 and you were born. And yet given your, , your delineate jump both sides. of all these used to crats and those English, some of them Spanish, and so on. I mean, it's quite a list of condesses and various, , countersons and so on. , when I was reading that, I kept thinking, , it's something  a dick and it's not ,  I kept expecting that. At some point, someone's going to come along and discover who don is and everything will be okay. Is that what's happened? This came out where... ought be... and that's all I was hoping for. And I said, I need all of you. Okay, good stuff. And it's been, it was one of those things. And it, it, it's been a long row. It's just, everything's just a long row circle. I'm, I've done mansion bit. I've done the debutant bit. I've been everything. Now, give me a little piece. Let me be me. Okay. Violating the boundaries always different though. It typically when one does cross for Bidin Lones, Interracial on Interreligious Marriage, or announcing that on this gang, or choosing on sex, at least there is a community waiting for you on the other side. But Dawn has caused so many borders at once, that she has slipped into a country or she is the English citizen. She is poor, her husband is schizophrenic. Her... life is fairly harsh. Her books overcompensating my sentimental. She speaks a neat language, and kind of a topic on dance. Even as I sat in her living room, slightly ermonatics in her dogs, her wonderful and takes aged into room. It was difficult not to feel a row respect for her for roughing it out. No one pressured her into the life she chose. She dwells in her own private Charleston. Now a bonafide manager. Ready to serve. of tea, hospitable, even brave, but alone. When I asked her at the end of her interview, she remembered a little redheaded boy who stared into her gates. She allowed that she did. She said she had quite fond memories of the family in the street. She chose not to mention the obvious that my father refused to publish her story in the local paper. Instead, on the true chastonian, she behaved as if she'd stumbled upon an old acquaintance and was so put delighted to be born. back in touch. Then, does every child's done ? Including myself would do. She changed the subject to something more comfortable. A few days later, I received another note that began, Dear Jack. As you and my red hair boy at the gate, I think I should contact the Nutmaster Hit. She said that she had bought her new house, and managed to store her place in Hudson's Main Street. It has some age to it, and she hopes to fix it up. Is this the customer in England? She wants to give the house a name. She's pretty much set on using the title of a book by her old mentor Vita Sakhan West She wants to call her new house all passion spent question mark She invites me to come visit and then the letter ends casually you are sincerely The Losers are so blue, walk around the world. Act 2, Dawn of New Era. What up until this point in the program, you've been listening to a story that first aired on our show to 1.5 years now. Since then a lot has happened, Dawn, incredibly has moved back to Charleston, the urging called the Victoria Road. Have more thoughts. Tell us your thoughts, what are your thoughts going on here to ignore or ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? She now lives in and otherwise all black neighborhood in the run-down of house. She meets with old women basically has managed to get the life that she wanted as a dowager, in Charleston. Dawn's the secret of husband John Paul, now was in the mentoring institution. The jacket is stated, touch, that many others that began my dear Redhared Boy. This is Monday published a story in the magazine GQ, but what he's learned since his original report for a program. TV shows a guy who can control the plague and does. After I did the initial interview, he's heard him at years ago for a Disney school life. She and I maintained a correspondence. She wrote me pretty much every other day. And each of these little typewritten letters. Often a letter, but more often and not, it's an envelope containing clips from the local newsband that are in some way indicative of subjects that she thinks she and I share. They often have... I'm almost metaphysical, significant, for example. One story was about finding something tragic or often, just outside the harbor. I couldn't figure out what the meaning of one is until suddenly just sort of stared at the headmind. All charsten continues to yield its secrets. And I, I, it, it just suddenly done a minute, maybe that was the only reason she set me. Wow, was that heaven? Oh, it's  each one is  a little hyperglove right there right in cryptic I sometimes don't quite understand why I'm getting it But anyway, so yes, don't I very much stating contact we've seen each other a bunch of times since then I've met her daughter And met her two grandchildren When you thought out your story for us and you did your story for us two and a half years ago When the story ended you weren't exactly sure what to believe about your story And since then all this contact with her meeting family Spending where it time with it you actually now know what you believe to be the truth. Well I do. I do believe that she was born a woman with a defect. when I first interviewed her from the program, when I came home, remember the my wife who participated in this sob surgery for the local hospital. So this problem called translation, and subsequent reporting. with a pediatrician named Angelo Ejune taught me that this condition is called hyperplasia. And then in fact it's common enough that every child at birth in this country is screened for it now. Her description of what she went through, every detail, sort of, , by in-woman and  lack of breast development. all the various affliction she talks about through that through her adolescence and her adulthood. , we're described exactly that way by Dr. Jane when I introduced her. And so, , plus the fact, , I interviewed her daughter at length. , I found when Dawn moved back to Charleston, the daughter was there. She's working two jobs and I just asked her out right. , there are people who think that you are, mother is not a woman. EmB explain that she knew in a way that a daughter would know that she was one. Well she said she took care of her. She takes care of her. I mean, Dawn has been, he's had a rough time physically for decades and the daughter has taken care of her in the way that a nurse would take care of her. One of the things you mentioned in the story is this story that Dawn tells us about him attempting to lie if you go in and in your original story two and a half years ago to present this, , look at all the tales around the swimming. Do you have an opinion now about whether in fact those things happen? , to listen to Don Telling Story. I mean, I think she mythologizes herself as much as we did, but to a different end. , I mean, I was amazed at every story she had to tell had very similar themes to them. Of a lost aristocrat being denied her. do. And in some way, , she is the, she is in real life, in her childhood, she was the illegitimate offspring of Vita Sackville West's chauffeur. He is shunned by all of these people. She always sees herself as being kept out of her real life of the life that she was supposed to live. And it's true. And those things never escape her telling. of almost any snorke. And so when she tells the story of someone breaking into her house and trying to harm her and beating her or whatever, I think there is a core of truth to these stories. But I think it's very complicated. I think, , she has a narrative way of telling her stories that make them seem, I think, preposterous to make them cool. I mean, I guess one of the things about the story which is so tragic. , the stories that we tell. ourselves about who we are, the stories that other people say about who we are. And if those two things go match up in large part, , you're in trouble. And that's what happened to her. The story that she believed about herself is so radically different from the story that the world believed about her. Right. And realized it to world from very beginning was forcing her to live. a myth that she was in man. When in fact on some level so there's a woman,  in the GQBs there's an anecdote in the cross. She kept mentioning Carson and Colors. I want to look at Carson and Colors by her and it turns out that Gordon was mentioning him but it's a rather eerie scene. It's only one mention of Gordon and the entire by her and Carson and Colors. And the Colors comes to Charleston and some point in the end. in the 60s and Gordon this experiment. And Gordon has Gordon at that point as well, and the novelist has Carson McCulloch in the beginning. This is right in the street, this is the one I'm ten years old. And so Carson is an old person at that point. And at the end of the pond, hasn't said much the entire evening, but at the end of the party asks Gordon come sit and share the one in the talk. very briefly. And McCuller's description of this moment is that Gordon sort of talks on and on for a few minutes about this in that. And finally, McCuller stops me and in texture and the sec.] Jack hit is the author of innumerable magazine articles and innumerable books, he writes about Don and October 1998 issue in GQ.
