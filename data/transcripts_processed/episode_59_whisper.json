  "text": "Look a lot of kids  to play with my snap-off match heads from matches. How do I know how to play with them? You make little paper boats, put them in the toilet, and say, I was fast, but I watched it and fly, and I was silent. It was powerful. I just liked the idea of things. I liked watching the two of them. I liked the crackle. I could watch it for hours. And nothing else or all about it. Later on, he's job is forage. And we're playing with lighters, but not good. There's still up, still up, can't so fair. We're playing against the punch. Because we get to shoot out one of the holes and stuff. In a short story, some say the world. Susan Perbe. of his character explain the Sith willing to hurt, but that's in fires. It's a moment when it may or may not go out control. This is a terrible rites. The thing about fire is this, it's yours for one glorious moment, you bear it, you raise it. The first time you're registered around town, stood over the bathroom and trashed you. I think I wouldn't let it grow, but I would love it, only to a point, and kill it. That's a trick with fire, that 30 seconds you have choice. Spirits. it's step on it, the house with a camera code. But wait one moment too long, it caught up in its beauty and it's grown beyond your control. You need to use that moment that I live with. It's a big adventure. Power passes from you to it. The world opens up new with it. I cried in the record show and the name rose above my head. Not fear, but I'm exhausted. Welcome to WVZ Chicago with the Summer of Life from our class. Today on our program, stories of people who are not appropriately scared of fire. Act 1, fire starter, while 1 teenager set fires and then stop setting them. Act 2, Centraalia, and inextinguishable subterranean fire on the edge of a small Pennsylvania town and why the fewer many residents are not afraid of it. Act 3. Firewalk. That acts as bad a guy who is not afraid of walking on burning coals and how he might have been safer if he had simply taken the simple precautions of being afraid Act 4. The big picture on fire. The really really really big picture at 5. Fire with there. Stay with us. Back one. Fire start. Our fire starter is 29, was New York City, and he moved from a casual interest in fire to our intellectual criminality. And what's striking about his story is that he wasn't motivated by anger over venge or any mean feelings to it's anybody. He just wanted to stare at fire the way a child does. And he didn't want to sleep. So, we're getting both of us. The serious test team. And when I went to college, there was a house on campus that got hit by a truck by a drunk driver. The rumor was that the house was rescheduled for demolition. So my friends and I decided to get sent to us. for demolition. There wouldn't be much time in setting the house on fire. And we decided to start a fire. We went there, we cried the boards off the house before the fire. The board was off. Climbed into the window. And lit it on fire and climbed the window. I was , I was giddy. with excitement. I was, my whole body was just  this thing. And we stayed away for a good hour or so, , to make sure we weren't caught at the scene of the climb. But I do remember coming back seeing the fire, the trucks there. There was a, there was a few minutes in. disappointment because fire had been put out before the whole house had burned down. I think the fire never really got out of the bedroom. So there is definitely a disappointment because the whole house had burned down. And that was our goal. And if I could have done things the way I would have chosen to, we would have said the house on fire. Sad off on a little hill at a safe distance watching you. , drinking. bears and watching it, watching it consume itself, watching slowly, , start to build and then peek and then watch the house fall down. The fire eventually goes out and everything just starts to ashes. That would have been. That would have been. That would have been the way I wanted things to happen. I'm trying to find a fireman yet. for today's programs. When they we discover it is that first it's actually very rare a real meaning of somebody with a real meaning of psychological compulsion to set fires. Second, when it does occur, psychologists classify it as a sexual disorder, often as a sign of sexual abuse. That wasn't the case with this guy, he was mild, he referred to a real mind-interest-and-fire did stop fairly suddenly. a couple of years ago, I think some of the mentioned that I used to be a fire bug and I realized that I wasn't fascinated by fire. And I started wondering what I was. I started thinking back. Realizing my fast fire ended right around first of the time I got laid. And I was fascinated to find that this was true. I was completely in. aware of it at the time. It wasn't until I  five or six years after it stopped that I looked back and realized that I had stopped my fire right around the time. I started with six. I think now I have a normal relationship with fire. I don't use fire to express myself. Act 2. Centroium. This is the story of the town, decimated by fire. This is all built up along here, or post office right here at this one. Homes across the street. This is built up with the south. How am I, Maryvain, that's at the window of the municipal building, the vote is in the middle of town. Right here on this side of the home as a place to go. First we start. General is the one. So, just about everything now. The rainbow leafs are across here. So, describe this name. Just the mostly highways here now. Home there and yeah. Only one store in the stands on the center street. They can lots around it. Perhaps two dozen homes are left out of hundreds of these three here. Personality does not listen. After a few days All the food in one. Two. Some food now. One food. Some Crossing. One Big Room. Hough... Teniza Mapan destroyed. All the food I owed me back again. Australia once had 3,000 people at it, mother of 30. You fire the decimated this town, scattered it's inhabitants far and wide, never touched a single home, never sinched the burden. This is a town destroyed by the idea of fire itself, never came. Fire that led to the evacuation of Centauria began out on the edge of town, and abandoned strip-minded in 1962. Through 30 end-of-gown mined fires  the Spring-Ground-Consonine , it went slow for years, and thus done in Dane Traine. But Centauria's built over old coal mines, and the fear was that the fire would jump, a mine to move it, and end up under the center. The coal is burning, one small section, at the end of our burn. and it has never gone anywhere else. Never. I met with five of the remaining residents of Syntheli, one eighth of the town in the town council's meeting room. John Comarinsky, the science teacher we knew by high school, has put the goal out through the establishment charts and reports that Kovie says that the subterranean fire is not. This is off the government's website apparently that's what they told us back when this is from the Department of Community and Economic Development. That's the boys who are basically , giving their lives up and is coming out. We do a lot of wrong decisions. But none are themselves having the right time. So, will you guide them abroad? Yeah. There's no argument important! It's empowering this whole thing running whole program. And you can see that basically you have the gross intreye here, and you have firebeam spread in this direction, that direction, and all these other directions, south west. Yeah, intreye is the only place you need direction in this and calling. And in fact, this federal study says that that's what should happen. And because there's a mindful underneath intreye, call underneath, right now we're at calling underneath this is underwater. And there's no way that it's going to be a real problem. There's no way that... that even government will try and try and tell you that all that water burns. Is it just does it? I was involved in this from 1969. Telemoma is the reason government is trying to convince the people of Central, that they're kind of endangered and evacuated. It's because in trade it's not as much as 3.2 billion. That's billion. That was worth the call. This is what this whole entire situation is about. Our call ends. I don't care who you talk to. I don't care what they say. They are not telling the truth. They could talk to their blue and the face about how, , we should get out of here because we are in danger from gases, from subsidenses from all these horrible elements and that isn't true at all. If we didn't have any COVID need thus, centrally would be right where it is, the entire community. I don't know about a hard evidence. Who the government's jersey? The paper trial, no witnesses. no names that were willing to name on the record. But they do seem to be entirely correct about this. 35 years the fire has not moved. The edge of town for some. And it's not injured anyone. What seems to have happened in Central Asia is this, fire burned for 19 years. And then in 1981 came one of those turning point made for TV events that can take your average on going on extinguish-subterranean fire and turn it into a statewide media circus. I'm February 14th. 1981. Tom Daboski was walking across his backyard when the ground beneath him suddenly gave way and he was knee deep in steaming mud. This is a video made by the state to brief its own policy making history as a fire. Fortunately, a friend heard his cries for help. He managed to reach into the hole to track him out by the color of his coat. Government officials who are visiting Central Syria every day and a moment he could just reach the end of its toll the lights thrown beneath his harness. Traveling to Queensland through Haiti at Rik Reiniffiner bankruptcy to the one of the earliest markets to drive on WW7 walked across the road. Someone in their party dropped a large block into the hole and no one heard his hit bottom. Before the story of deepen years, the big political fight in this entree of his townspeak trying to get the government fucked by the death. After the story of deepen years, the government declared there was no way to tell where the fireman connects. They decided to evacuate. Bill Clang had it to be location effort, says it was the only reason for decision. Clang stayed tried to react barriers to the fireman. block fights. It's a place to jump in. They crunched in the service, why ash? Most of the environmental material. This was to keep the fire from crossing the road that is now closed off up at the top of the hill by the cat church. Well, fire did it. Wind through there. And on the other side of the road, and then they put a clay barrier on top of that, and that's right. Keep the visit review. And I... Honestly, believe that when a fire gets connected to the disease now, it is  hurricane or anything else. You don't tell the fire what it does with a damn bomb, please. The government calculated that it was cost $42 million to buy a million times. It requested the 50th federal government. Once people heard of that, they should find a system. come on, town square. Lots of people living in this old houses with a co-computer that gets before it. Very, very few people moved out of this town because of the fire. I want to make that perfectly clear. The government came in with big bucks. A lot of the homes their children had all left. They were raised. They were left with these white elephants, big houses. A lot of it made them need fixing. So they knew that. Where to make the most money was to sell your home to the government? Two community organizations faced off. One, keep people in Central Europe and fire out. The other, sell out, get out. People in the other camp knew we were having one more shoot. They were both smoking or phased and public. They were the passports at her when she worked. Banked to our job. Somebody with an M85 or a cracker under lawn. Somebody else threw a cat out. I know one thing. They are people. that moved out of this town that can't wait till we're all out because then and only then will they have peace mind. Because as long as there are someone left in Centralia as adamant and committed as we are hearing this town, they will never have peace mind on what they did. Because they many, many of them know that they were instrumental. In having satralia, they could do the conditions they are that we've done. They would stop talking to you. They would stop being friendly. And that moment, very moment that occurred,  that, they were going to be next. That was the main thing, they would just stop being friendly, they would stop being friendly. And that was your first indication that you say you have to do. We'll do it around the people  the moon, the people  the state, the level of the method. There were a lot of things. You're a lot of the way. Can you talk to former Central University residents  Jerry West of Shanskill? The little town wasn't even in the trail. Then law. Thank you for your time. We'll move into a task for your membership. He had several other former residents, did confirm with how a moment that he was never scared of the ungot fire reached his house, never scared of underground gas. Mostly, it says, the move because it's the great deal to get me to get him. He was all right. Although then it was 3,000. We're done in a more than a little bit of 50,000. $35,000 in best. $22,000 in profit. Now, Jerry Lersu, this son, Rob, about 10 minutes drive from St. Charlotte in that carna, well, that's from St. Charlotte. Perhaps he's a hell out of all the time for the game. St. Charlotte changed. You'll be in Bombard over the 110 feet and we're at one time. It was just getting to be too much. The town wasn't  it was. If it was, they'd that way would follow the state of the game. But  what, more and more people who want it was just on the way. As with most government operations in the scale of this evacuation, there are really two ways to work with the happens in Triumph as a conspiracy, the way the remaining counts people see it. There are simple human incompetence, the way Jerry Sun Robbsies. What would the government do now, we spend all that money, we're not going to take to say they were wrong, they're not going to move in the state. Not the guys who would have made the mistake, they're already probably going now in the last 20 years. The federal government spent a little bit of a year to go for 20 years down the line they won't admit that they can't just say I have fire milk that was in case that I did not get away. It's 40 to million dollars in brawleda this. I mean they spend a lot more money on different crazy things but you just don't want to see them off of the land back or even to sell it. Money or start the town. Actually. There's a third way to do the happens. The way the bill claimed had to be a location at which is a government program that actually worked. The very example government competence, generosity. Don't get me wrong. I agree with the people over there that for a long time the government did not respond to this thing the way they should have and that's why it's got pointed it is. But when the government finally came through for them and said, look, we're going to give you a chance to get out of here. Not only that, we're going to give you a chance to build a new house and make yourself whole. We're not just going to give you that maybe if you're lucky to have $10,000 your property is worth, so that you can actually go out and build a new home or a smart. That's pretty hard to ask up for those people. 1992, after a decade of voluntary revocation. Beep from supply. The state condemned the remaining concern, thought everyone they had to get out. It's called a mid-dominant. The mayor and town council back then took the support, peeled it all the way up to the US Supreme Court. They did not mean one case. Then the town council back then resigned. Left town, saying it was open. They'd lost. Legally, no one has the right to stand since they're here. The 40 guy heard she's still living in a town in one mile. He's fine on the patch, so we'll be there. I had a neighbor who we fought shoulder to shoulder for years and years and then she got involved with Turn Yeah, but not not only that. It's not only she didn't she turned. She she stopped talking. She She turned into a different person absolutely different person And what she ruled of her part She lives in... ...off on music. It's very close. Very close. That's such. Well, I mean, that's her. That was her decision. No, that's actually, we were neighbors and we were... That along wonderfully. That was sad. Now, in the long stretch of grass, we asked these two middle-of-town. Someone put in some tension. And scientists, we were some trying. Terry Wes or Shansky and the other of them left down is the idea of fire, travel from the home's elsewhere, and back to some try. Not for the town that it is, but for the idea of what? I know I go up there and I'll share the name guys, we're up there at night and we're there's a very do? I remember when I was a girl. Our house caught on fire And all maybe forget the local one follow the space As he gathered me in his arms The race to the burning building had on the pavement And I stood there shivering I'm watched the whole world go up in flames My knees are low enough No say to myself Is that where it is too fun? Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, Then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the blue. This is the story about somebody who wasn't scared of fire and who did get her. He came study Buddhism, meditated, boy the red knee. When a friend sent him an email inviting him to fire walk retreat, thought, why not? Get the other retreates that you go, meditate, and with combination of the Buddha. we can, walk across hot coals. To make a long story short, handed up with near third green burns, admitted difficult walk for weeks. He spoke with this American life for tissue news here. He had read a lot about Firewax, knew our common ritual practice around the world. The story was always the same. Now when it's burnt, never happens. The one person we knew who it was on Firewax, didn't get burnt. The leaders of retreat was so confident and we'll get burnt. and even bother to bring first ace of lives. The way that we can start it was we participated in open-sympathetic exercises that were designed to impure off these layers in person if that we build up, and show to world to protect our deepest selves. How do you feel those layers on them? We're all dying to know. Well, even one ace says had the peak. their paratrox and to prove. And one person would simply stare into the others' eyes. While the person who's here stared at what happened to the answer, questions , who are you? Who will I give them to gather together to screw them strangers to, in a share with each other that move into me. So why are you laughing? I don't know this dude. you participated. Well, I guess I had a warn you that there was much of what I have to say. It could very well be a free, a new age in Charlie. I think it's kind of funny, but I do believe in the most. After the sun went down on that Saturday, ... We all formed a human chain with one part of the chain or one person standing at the palm foot and the other person at the palm foot of the palm foot of the palm foot. And so every single law that when it's building the fire, , passed along the chain. Hmm. , we surrounded the fire and the circle. And is it hot on your face? It is. It was unbelievable. We were standing for a five-day. We were still feeling. And still, at the point where it's on your face and it's so hot and it's this huge bond fire and you're looking at this, this, , on- Inferno. Inferno. Thank you. , you're still not scared, you're feeling what you can. There isn't any fear nor is there any concern. There's this kind of dull sense of content in peace. Hmm. Sure. The dull contentment in peace that precedes a third degree bar. Right. So, one explanation for why people don't keep article articles is that they're so nervous, they sweat, and that layer of moisture protects the heat. In other words, he got burned because he was too certain that he wouldn't be. If he'd been more scared of fire, if he'd been nervous and sweat it, he probably wouldn't have gotten hurt. I had this this conviction. That. I wouldn't get her. I can't really think of next week's Hawaii I have this, but I just simply couldn't believe that I'm that. I mean the moment that I stepped on the call and you have to come back to this view, plus sis. And ... I don't know what it was in me that compelled me to walk in but I made a promise. And collapsed into one of the conveyor of arms. I was in a state of panic. Now at a point where I felt  all my entire belief system just collapsed. So I'm sitting up to the side not only the people who are also taking me to on your cross of iron. And are you saying anything? Do they know that you've been burned? Actually the way that I compose myself, everyone thought I was working with me. I didn't say or do anything to suggest to the others that I want to be working with. Where? You're perpetuating the racist cliche about your people. You're a screw to ball. You didn't say anything? No, what do you have to clue? You're early in that day when you're three by five pieces, we might find the next part. You'll be broke down. and we each took turn one at a time, point up to the fire and the tough things come to fire. What were those fears? I guess it's a simple way to put it one here of speed. And that was a good. I feel  I got burned because getting burned was the appropriate experience. I have a mirror cause. it would be me. Oh yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah, I think that's it. I think that's it. This week in Houston, so we've come last in my song. mier ыми I'm so much to love, but you can't leave me and I ain't gonna try. Every time I see you face my heart's lost burning. Every time I hold your man heart and burning. Every time I call your name, my poor heart bursts out of flames. You're the blades on this panel of fire. Man, oh man, oh man, we'll come up with a step back. For the big picture, on humans and fire, the really big picture. That's in a minute when I program continues. American life of my reclass. Each week on our program of course we choose a theme, a variety of writers and performers to contribute various kinds of stories in the theme. Today's show, people who are not afraid of fire. We've arrived at four as promised, a big picture. Stephen Pye, a professor, believes that we Americans as a people, as a group, are two afraid of fire. And he says this has all sorts of... practical consequences. For example in Yellowstone National Park, Heinz says the Forest Service Policy of Succeeding Fires for the last hundred years out of Fierre Fire has led to an incredible overgrowth, a flammable material which calls the fires in 1988 to destroy it half apart. In other words, by trying to avoid fires, we call them down upon us. Pines says that what humans have done throughout history is set fires in a controlled way. And that part of our problem today is the way that we think about fire. We do not see it. practical tool that we're faded. That's a very recent and in some ways there's our perception. There are good reasons to be a brain of fire. It's dangerous and to be unpredictable. But people have always paired that perception of fire with the sense that it was necessary, essential, that is what made the world habitable. I mean if you think about fire origin, myths and all cultures have Almost always the story goes that humans are sort of a less capable, well less well-in-doubt species than through various means, usually by, by gile or theft. Humans get it, or given it, and then become powerful, then, as sense, they become human, and the essential features that we are become apparent. I mean, many ways we really are, the keepers of planetary flying in the sense that somehow. if we could abolish fire would be in our interest or the earth interest, it's very peculiar, very modern, in urban one. When you talk about societies, where fire is valued, what's the city? We're talking about most agriculture, but we're talking about almost every society other than basically in urban industrial one. Industrial societies have sort of sublimated fire into machines. We're not burning wood. living biomass so much as fossil biomass. In other words, we've gone from actually having real bond fires to these tiny good ole combustions and set-in. That's right. And we have essentially people's contact with fire, particularly in cities, people's contact with fire is almost always negative. That spot in the city is not a nice habitat for fire. It occurs in wild forms of stainless. So the people used to grow up if you were a little siding you grew up. burning off debris of the spring, burning off your foul fields, burning off pastures, get rid of the old grass and start to know all kinds of little sort of spring cleaning fires in me will. And fires were other purposes, and it seems to me all that kind of personal contact the flyers gone. And what we have largely left is a kind of imagery, or a kind of virtual fire. Pires is presented for their telegenic effect fires used to traumatize. other phenomenon and it almost every case requires negative. Actually, as you described to say, realize all of the movies and all of the previous movies have seen what we're fired as a huge element in those movies. There's a whole sequence of movies out now. We're volcanoes at cities on fire. I was at one of the Star Wars movies and one of the things that struck me was just how much of the movie was simply about blowing things up. Well, all in things up and at least there is a more benevolent and ancient image in the last event where you have the people. a normal player for a Darth Vader. But in general you're right, almost anything you can think of now, fire is used to sort of give visual and dramatic power to the story. But you are getting in some way that we have this visual fetish for fire because fire is not a part of our everyday lives. I think we're allowing that to remain un-challenge because in our personal sense we don't have. Sensor, fire is a good force. fire is a useful to fire is something that makes the world habit. Well, what kind of economic video do you want to see? Well, I would just  to see hardfires. I would  to see some agricultural fires. I would  to see the forest service, pair of smoky bear, with a complementary figure, smoky twin brother separated of birds. He's there with the grip torch. Now they're together, it's , arm and arm. That's the way it should be. And children would sometimes follow the example of smokey the ones sets the fires, the other smokey. I don't have a lot of parents but I go with you on that one. Well, it's not designed for urban environments, but I would  to have it in our consciousness that such things are possible. So you are going in somewhat we need to get back to fire, we need to embrace fire more Well, I would  to see us first intellectually in Brace. I recognize that it is really part of our parroting just in species. We have a species monopoly and it's sort of right now. So that seems to me very strange. We have a species monopoly in any other animals and not masquerade fire and we have. That's right. And if sure we will never allow a new species. I was going to say if snakes get fired, what will we do? I think we're in big, big trouble. Easy! I mean our whole premise is that we control if Tows get fired. Well suddenly the whole thing comes undone. Actually I've written an novel on this and it was a real mask because I'm not trained right now but the premise seems to me of legitimate one to think about. I mean maybe we've done such a bad job as a species and nature finally turns the task over to somebody else who can do it right. Steven Pines, the author of books Burning Bush, Fire and America and World Fire. The FIRE with N. The Amnest is next to it. This next story isn't really about fire. It's called fire. It mentions fire. Produce name is RENEST SPIRE. But basically we just really liked this story and we thought we would end this show. I was carousel from reading the sometimes in the car but I couldn't stop reading. There was an article wedged in next to Ty Calm with helpful household hands. Right above today's choco. The article reported a study that proved that an emergency situation's people respond or seriously when someone's scream fire, the one someone's screamed help. Your average person just didn't respond to the word helping. The worded loss is punch. The study coordinator suggests that the people should scream fire even when there was no fire. Below that article was a piece about how putting brick in your toilet could eventually conserve an upwater to fill a kiddie pool. I stopped reading them because my husband's demon was yelling at me. This ran a yell at me and parked the car at the same time. It was too much for me. Who's yelling things ,  I told you, God damn it, what do I say? He was thinking about too many things at once and nothing was getting done right. We've been driving around around the cramp streets and we could park over 40 minutes searching for spot. Reading that junk is just wasting brain sense, he said. He might as well sit in the way from the TV. Traffic makes me nervous and helps if I read it, I told him. That's because you're not driving. We're going back and forth  the services he picked me up in the street. work. It was me because I hadn't asked my boss for a raise. My annual review had come down and I hadn't as he put it, made my move. Stephen on the other hand had pulled a 20% raise out of his review plus an office or the window, the major move of a peatured, personal best. He was disgusted with me, the Tony Cubeclaw which I spent my day stuffing down, without any attempt at the advancement. He wasted weeks before my review day, giving me peptox to boost what he turned my corporate aANDs, keep on fighting. Either step up paddy said, read it stepped over, it's that simple. But the no-you-un-move walked faster down hallways, be quality I contact. Just even the way it's on, , the SES, , still renew criticism my boss excited as reasons for giving me only a cost of living increase. And manage much of a chin-moon steak. The secret dream, to break all the retrievers out into acres and subvers, seem to be moving further and further away. Stephen during the car into the alley behind our building, this was the sign that we were giving up our parking search for the day. Back to the next one dumpster surrounded by new parking signs and broken glass. We already had 15 outstanding hundred-dollar tickets from parking in the Sally. Tenels was the suggested limit before they towed the Stephen feuds to take mass transit. He had a system. Every time we park the car, he turned the wheels as far to the right as they go. Whoseless, Whose bandwidth is this may not exist. impossible from Carby Toe. Unfortunately Stephen was a man of many such theories. He insisted that night pair was 90% water and that all TV networks were working together by the scenes. He flipped up and down the ten-up lock news shows comparing anchor people, graphics, weather reports, until inevitably he did two shows to his special port in the same subjector, two networks airing the same commercial at the same time. See, look at this idea of the screen. This is exactly what I'm talking about. See if in Park's circles to the dumpster I had to crawl over the gearshift to his side to get out. And walk quickly up the alley to the street, just as we turned on to our block, he grabbed my arm. Pat, if I died you going to heaven, am I having a stroke? A long station might even put inside and is pulling out a few feet ahead of us, inch by use, exposing pavement as dark as new tar, and a gleaming white herd. Space head to see the sunlight in decades. It was  seeing a new one at a time of bill. This wall of horror sucking me cheeks and me excited. Is that a spider? Is that a spot? Steven was grinning so hard as Facebook and believe in Twitch. His fingers flexing in an audience by arm of the cacat clawing a plank. It's a spiral right I said. Big one. You want to bet on how many seconds before it's gone. Listen, Steven, a quick whisper. Go stand and walk at the car. Don't let anyone. And, not anyone! Stephen, you can't save Spots by standing in my seat. This isn't kindergarten. This is the kind of thing people get shot of. Just down there, you guys dance somewhere, am I right? His voice reached a threatening pitch. Sweat was beat it up on his forehead. At, get in that spot! I stepped forward into the space, staring down at the indentations as Broggy Lee Loafers made in the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street. I crumbling ears into fists and pressed my fingernails on his position. I'm so hard to step off of them. I felt  sobbing. These were acrylic nails that caused a fortunate love of the lady, the nails of mum of the lake. I forced my figures out straight and dropped a broken nail, a flash of fluttering peak. Stephen disappeared into the alley. You and it passed two sounds. I detected the fades mouse and the green working with me to sit at the air. It calls my eyes for a moment, imagining perfect love, a cement patio, and calls him a treasurer's in a wire-miss candle. Headlights walk across the bed and a car tree corner, a big rumpling car, behind the wheel, delicate man, some dwarf by his car, and imagined him propped up on telephone hooks to reach the wheel. His window rolled down and pushed his head out, carefully maneuvering on one of the cups cap through the open window. He said something. and I couldn't quite catch it. His voice was high and thin, freakishly thin. I stepped forward, but still I couldn't hear what the man was saying, and I was so as next to it, being as bold as he raised his voice. He just couldn't quite catch it. At least I hope they hadn't, because when I thought he said was, are you gonna move or do I have to run you all? I got it for the early, though son of Stephen. Man, I wish. This time I heard him clearly. Are you trying to save that spot? It's mild at me. I look down around me at the space of naughty. My husband is pulling up from the alley. Both turn staring nearly nothing. You think there's room for two of the man's? The staircase, the empty space, the bedroom, the carlins with my eyes. This was just the kind of spatial relationship task I've done for the end school. I don't know why I said, I'm here I guess. For I could work on my reasoning, he smiled at me again. I sent him back a white grin, he returned a soft knowing stare. This is the man pulled him to the parking spot, and I saw with the children fear that there was definitely not going to be room for two cars after a while. Our career appeared at the massive alley, the Stephen hunched over the wheel. I looked at the spot being taken, looked at me, and squealed from the reverse back to me, Ali. Was that your husband, man, as? Who's out of his car now? He had a black t-shirt and shiny- white pants. His arms and legs were pale and boneless, if he was torsive. He was here, man, to go, I said. He backed down into the alley. I guess he thought there wasn't room. What kind of cartoos he tried, man, as? And he saw that all of you. Awake. You can definitely fake, go get him! I can move up further, I'm sure of it! I have my doubts, remembering your shared smiles, and move up onto the sidewalk from constantly. Just as I stepped away from the spot, the cartoon took the block, again low, looked back. Go on, man, baby, listen, I'll see the spot, sides, hello at this point. It's a catty! Show me what fit in a million years! I smile. Nisha, thanks, man. I had to tell you. Still was double targets at the dumpster again. They noticed him in the glass. He held his finger on window button. Glass hung down into the door. I'm sorry I told him. I thought there was room. That guy says he'll try and move up if you want to pull him again. No one, Steven said. His voice barking up towards the stereo. And there's an entire planet in any car from any country. If you're fit into that spot, I'm not gonna. I'm embarrassed any of us by trying. And what do you want to do then, Nathan? Okay, okay. He let out his long theatrical first of here. I'll go through the motions. Why not? Why don't we just sleep in the car tonight? Hope the TV is a dashboard and just wait for the police to show up in the morning. He steps in the clutch. The scanner on his eyes and mouth will re-voluntly. Go on, I yell. You can do it. I turned him in in the pit of the street. After me there, sitting by the stairs, going to the room. I'll try to cool the man's in his car, and she'll look at his the bump of car and some feet. It was the squeal of metal rubbing of his metal. It covered something up an inch active and slammed into the back bump of the next car. The man turned the car off, jumped out smiley. He created it most in the floor five inches of space. Even though it was half inches of spot and broke back out of it. Finally, he screeched off again to him's heels, a third time. The men-wised student sounds in sidewalk as a Honda came along the corner and glided smoothly into the spot. Two girls jumped down. Marla is a part of his that way when he was set to the other. She's got this new food town counter to full marble. I caught the perfume in the air as they clipped away down the sidewalk. Something between Marla and Lillies. Steven said foes for wolves, he liked earth tones, everything needed to be earth tones so that our apartment ended up looking with a pile of dirt. I walked on the alley, Steven was bent over the trunk of the car pushing down hard enough to make the car bounce. Damn this trunk, isn't it? It's never worth rice as we were broken into. I'm sorry I gave away our spot on the same. I knew it was second we wouldn't fit each night, not a million years. As long as one last time was the trunk at clip-painfully to lock. I shouldn't have done it, I said. I know that now. It doesn't matter, Patty, sir, turning the face to me, but it seems way to get stuck. What's one more ticket at this point? When Miles will start parking bus stops and handicaps sounds. There will footstitch behind us. It was made of a tick and a spot. He stood a moment, staring at us. She was sure down into his bike. pants. Your car is big for a knee sign he said finally. He asked the incident and heavy. Burns a lot of oil. I'm sorry I took your spot the man said. My car is bigger than I thought. Do you live here? Your point of choice, Billsie. You're not it. I just moved in he said. Last week during the storm. We headed at the early and around with the front court yard. The man talking is we walk on this depot. I just moved in  I said already I can't take the noise. How's the gate open? And then the three of us were standing in court area. We stopped, surrounded by our building and three sides in behind us to the street. Hi, Bob, I'm a third floor maybe. Someone was practicing corner and one of the open windows in the first floor. I can hear a woman talking softly. That's a good kitty. Mom will not look good, baby kitty. Do you have a problem with the noise, man? And sure, Steven said everybody does. Frankly, the man said, I don't know if I can take it. The woman above me walks back and forth all night long. That's not normal in my book. You should talk to her often. Through standing in a circle and suddenly, as if he made it a decision, the man stepped forward towards Steven. And he's back to me. He kept talking. I went up there twice already, and she said she's going to call the police on me. Fine, I told her. My piece being deserved, not hers. He had a broom, Stephen said, I used a broom. What? The man said stepping closer. I'm the ceiling, Stephen explained. Oh, so you do have noisy neighbors, the man said excited. We did, Stephen told him, they were old people, banging around the wheelchairs all day, and the man died, that ended. He knew the woman quieted down without him, and asked, thrust in his front of me, so it's taken us to the back and to the wall of a building. Oh, no, Stephen said nothing  that. Oh,  I said, I just moved in. Nancy into rubbed. His voice was going north and I had friends on Brie, , right around the corner, they have parking there. You have to pay and waiting for us to so long, practically have to kill someone move up. His voice sped up. The indoors move expensive, but not so much really.
