  "text": "Robert had a friend whose mother was a feared and powerful judge in New York City. And at some point she got sick and had to go into the hospital. Surrounded by doctors, she got shot right in and teaching hospital. This old lady kind of looks up from her pillow and she says, Do  the sweetest words in English language? That's the sweeter birth days of her затем in the guitar. ship their heads and she said the sweetest words are, don't be afraid, I'm a doctor. And after that there was nothing that she couldn't get. How smart. How smart. In the hospital we give up our normal schedule and sleep patterns. We give up our normal food and clothing. We're in a place that has its own rules and its own language and its own customs. We're not exactly how close. when not part-farmers. And in the midst of all this, there is this delicate human interaction which we have to negotiate. And it's one on which our lives are actual lives can depend. We have to deal with doctors and nurses and also to others staff. We have to get what we need for them. In the situation where they have all the power and knowledge, and they may not be as concerned with our care as we are ourselves. Private Lipsite wrote all about this in this book in the country of illness. When he got chemotherapy, he says, he meant dealing with a lot. different people in the hospital. You check the wind, the way you to blood pressure, maybe your finger stick, that's a happy little blood test. And there would be these little interactions with all the people, which always seemed really important, , they could hurt you more or less, depending on you. Certainly they could keep you waiting more or less. And it was almost kind of a... a ritualistic dance to see how you live really, , deal with them. Some, some to be joked with, some didn't. Antelgoi art wrote wonderfully about the need to seduce your doctor, to make medical personnel interested in you. In hospital where reduced the tactics the people have always used. Rat. human history when they have no power. We yell on screen, hoping that they'll give us what we want just to shut us up with nothing else. So we got  supplicants, acres before the Medici, while sweetness and goodwill. Well, today on our program, diplomacy does not just happen at Camp David and in Geneva and at the UN. Some of the most delicate and charged diplomatic negotiations happen every day, but for matters of life and death, at your local neighborhood hospital. This patient's try to get what they want and stay up first. what they think is best. At one of our program today is that your final answer, story of a family and a hospital, and why dressing well might get you better medical care. Back to the other nursing staff, in which we're quarter Nancy up to that answer is this question. Dorosio Donald and Jerry Springer have healing powers. Back to me. Fire and ice cream. Up 14-year-old boy tries to figure out what eat needs when his nurse asks him out for dessert. That poor looking for love in all the wrong places. Story of what happens when a patient violates one of the most basic rules of what to do in a hospital, over and over again, and survives for a while anyway. Let's see what it is. That one is that your final answer. Which here? Shines father was in hospital, bleeding in the screen. Terry and his four brothers rushed into action. But of course, is anybody who's ever been in this kind of situation knows, action mostly just means sitting around the hospital room trying to figure out what might possibly help things. It's made all the more difficult by the fact that figuring out what might help, first requires learning the language and customs of the average American hospital, which, to reach Shines family, do what you're trying to do. Nothing's changed. You just lies there. Everything's changed. No one goes to work, no one goes to the store, no one makes any plans of it to be at a father's bedside. We've become hospital rats. By day two, we know we're the best solar machine news. It has fresco. But day three, we know we're using the pay for home and making three calls from deep inside and nursing station B2. By day four, we know who the good nurses are. So much smarter and nice of you. On the bed, it comes at the beach. By day five, they'll somehow know what kind of car he's got to drive. The neurosurgeon has been... the S Cadillac civil, the cardiologist, classic quote that, the interns, GMCU con. I think it's his wife's joke that he's got an eye for that kind of thing. But day six we know what it was hobbies. Gerard flies those radio-concrolled airplanes, big ones. But we know no more about my frozen mission. After the surgery was all about the swelling going down, the brain has been through two surgeries. You're going to wake the doctor saying, once the swelling goes down, we'll see where we're at. Well, the swelling must have been... gone down by now, but we don't see it for me. Bill has been personalizing the room, bringing photos and hanging up an article from the Valley Stream in New York newspaper that recently chronicled my father's feats and World War II. As a photo of 24-year-old Danny learned shine and cool, fur-colored bomber jacket, Bill has marked details in the story with yellow highlight. I want the photos by his headboard so the army of medical workers taking blood every hour and constantly kneeling in your test and see he's not just a gown and limbs. He's a person who stood next to a Christmas tree two weeks ago and it pettled each gulfs, so that it was grandchildren wrapped around his legs. But my brother's think the picture should be on the far wall in his life's sight, so they will be immediately visible when the pups go here and they will end. I'm better breakdown of communication with a hospital person out of his best week. And I believe I've nailed down the reason. This fashion. That's what it's come to now. Something tells me that the nurses will start giving us respect. The doctors will start returning our calls, relating to gift shops, without following us to see what we're doing behind them in the rack of community babies. All this will happen to be step up our parents. We are a motley crew. In the short, some piece wicked L. T. shirts and Daniel was wearing that stupid fanny pack with his sweatpants and not helping. We've been dressing  a emergency room peepin. A family of citizens who cut the… their hands at barbecues are getting free car accidents on the way home from the beach and have to show up and flip-flop and hamps shirts. These poor people are quote with their pants down, but we have no excuse, you have days and days to find my wardrobe. We have to start dressing  intensive care people I found the way. I am certain that the doctors and the nurses will be much more attentive than my photos needs, we can only put a little more evidence to our appearance. We can hear our nurse now. I know I just checked on this to show I'm going to check in and again. Guys, it is so welcome. So today I am meticulously laying out my best clothes. Running my thumb and poor finger alone in sharp creases in my trousers. Spray is starking my wooded collars. We should get a second opinion bill said yesterday, question me diagnosis so far. We haven't got a first opinion yet. Nobody's talking to us anymore. Peter has a million questions about the blood thinner cumin. He's adamant that the doctor should never have described it to my foot. his heart condition to begin with. From what he's heard, it could have been the cause of the excessive bleeding. I looked it up on the computer and you can't eat salad when your honor he says. What kind of medication doesn't allow you to eat salad? And love salad, and see. I want some answers he says. One doctor up here told me he would never prescribe it for his heart patients. He says something is simple as stopping short in your car and cause bleeding the brain and you're on that stuff. Someone has to give us some answers. We keep getting past up and change the need. No one explained the fact that one doctor becomes... the primary in the case. Before it makes all procedures until after we call half a dozen of the doctors list the nuns charts. Nothing I even called this back at tell us that. We had to hear from a college kid in the snack bar who was recuperating from the street hockey accident. The primary, he said, that's the guy you got to get to. Once he put us on the right trail and nurse told us that we're going to talk to our father's cardiologist. But it's his brain that he's the primary, she said. The cardiologist has got to return our phone calls. Up. that was sitting by the phone anyway. When I get to his room and there's tells me that Dr. was just in, which one I asked, oh I haven't seen him before she said. This is how it works. No matter when you're in the room, the doctor has just been. We decide the one thing that would probably make this feel better on a day this, if you stop respecting Dr. We won't call them Dr. We'll leave off the title and we call him by the last name. I say, hey, that. It's a day to an exam. The reach of point we're not going back to is docked, it doesn't seem extreme enough. You should start coming home first, now don't get them to yourself. How are we going to find out the first names? Well, those says, there's called a multi-juve. The physician has been the primary hand case. The wounds supposed to coordinate all the others and keep them in up to date. Family phones, as to... tell me he's putting another doctor in charge of my quality because well I'm not as knowledgeable about the neurological stuff he said. He scheduled a meeting for this evening. The meet doctor both Zeki and the conference room in the ICU says she'll take care of everything from here on out. I wonder what if person he needs? The conference room turns out to be the nurse's break room and they're just getting ready to have a platter of neatly rolled cold cuts and cake for a staffers birthday. All this for us, then he says, Dr. Bozeki looks  an actress. playing a doctor. Very ER. Can't be more than 27, but she still has the power to get a party move down my whole room here. Please move it. She actually sustained around the garbage camera at the phone because my brother Pete and York have been patched in on the speaker phone. Hello, he says. The doctor starts talking quickly. I don't know your father. There's wasn't pictures in there or here or whatever. But anyway, you have to start thinking about his quality of life from his phone. Did your father ever talk about that in there for the interview... you subject come up in conversation she says. Each of the questions is landing with a gun, if mangled from a tree. We're not yet aware of the subject will come up in every conversation you have from this point on. Right now it seems to soon be a little shocked. You're still there, Peter, the doctor asked? Peter's little there. All our days till now have been spent waiting for this morning to go down, so we'll have them back. We know he's still in there. We've seen glimpses of the real hand in the squeeze of a hand of expression. leading moment of eye contact. And there's as I'm seeing those things Dr. Bazaak and says, a couple of nurses boisterously pulling open the door and then go speechless as they gaze upon a soul standing around the garbage can't talk you about the death. Before you move, I say. Anyway, the Dr. Bazaak continues. It's time for you to decide this. If you've got this heart stops, you restart it. The consensus of all his doctors is not to. Our consensus is to. Dr. Bazaak, you also have one of my thoughts. his nurses, a good one, unhanned for support. And G.S. had a step forward. You shouldn't restart it in your sense. You step back. We don't know what to say. I've a good now that the biggest decision most of us have made in our lives is whether to buy, at least, our minds are real and. I'm not sure you've covered time as a personal loud airste. It depends, G.S. is. When that restarting is hard and cold with holding sustenance and water bills , has your father talked to you about this because he has poignant. He'll say, yeah, it doesn't get running well deep, He wants you no more about how much progress they actually think my father can make But to be able to watch TV yes This mortal life and watching TV with us We all look at one Just times  this when I know my brothers and I are truly related God I wish I had assisted So you're saying he'll be able to watch TV then says That's the see if he's getting nowhere This is asleep on quickly exits. Probably going to hurry to get to the party. Peter, you're still there the nurse is. You're still there. Okay, we're going to hang up on your now and then there's says. Okay, here's. These legs are kicking in. The arms are flailing. This is no seizure. After the doomsday, tolequin goes echoing. And that's partying directly into the ear. Paul and he had to put on a show that doctors were going to give up on him. Something must have clicked because today he's dancing. He brought in some of his CDs, Louis and Ella around the boom box. And his toe is tapping. Oh fine romance you won't necessarily apply. We are impressed. The nurses are. They look at us , yeah, it's okay if you want some, we're just going to tap his toe for the rest of the flight. They want to see more than think of moving and following it. hands to want to seek communication. That, you can respond to a question by holding up one thing at pre-escent two for no bill says? No. But we keep working trying different things. I take a little speed for Danny Skolton. I don't take a little more speed in this condition. New family will do everything in my power to bring him back around. We'll draw the line. I take a one. But he just feels  part of the set of this power out. I've heard the peed burst into the room. There is no door to swing open or even a curtain to throw a sign But he always loses adrenaline and stalking a red of bill pushes you aside He's come directly from the airport and he's desperately charged up dad. It's me peat not if you can hear me You not you jumping the air. I could we not think of the nod I come you didn't think of the nod. I punched Danny. What do we have to fly a guy in from the you all pick up with the nod? Shouldn't the doctor's afford the nod then he says? Leave me when I high five people. We're high five For me it's a first. You're not good at it. I've got a copy of the living will on my pocket. There's no need for it now. If they want to know if he wants his heart we started they can ask him. We've got his attention. If anyone can pull through this you can dad Bill says You run into the hole when dragging nursing. Ask him a question for you to use. She asks, , yes, she takes no. So what are you going to tell the doctors that they ask you if you say what communicate to the coins and what are you going to say? She nods yes Yes, victory we have communication we have confirmation we have Progress Well progress in motion we've got all four corners of his bed covered But I don't know how long this window of coherency is going to last so it's frantically asking yes There's no questions in manipulating arms and legs The shuffling his legs around with his restless thing you want to get up and walk They take my hands and apply pressure to the souls of his feet and he starts pumping his legs His knees are up and he's wildly pedaling against my hands Yeah, yeah, this is okay if you want some of this I want to write a bike around for the rest of this life I have. I asked him to pounce up, he delivered, the floor was breaks out, and there's catches the erect thumb at the corner barrage, and gives us a sort of pitiful grin. Yeah, that's okay. He wants someone to just go and give you the pounce up for the rest of the life. She's the rain pouring through our open window. But we're not going to let her breathe all down. The blue eyes are clear. I love you, Dad. Pete says, can you believe we can speak of a nod, Pete? We're coming from opposite ends of the hospital parking lot. We've got newspapers tucked under our arms. We both had big plans today. I'm going to turn that corner of the hospital room and dazzle and be feeling good enough to sit up and I'm going to read and current events. Prime is down, the John Blends going up. They're less bigger plans. And what is reading glass he says? So you read the paper himself. We're only a couple of days away from the thumbs up, but this is a million miles. away. There'll be no reaching today. The first time, and I really feel sorry for my father, but I feel sorry for us. We are standing on opposite sides of the bed, and the papers in hand, and we do look pitiful. This is what the nurse said in the scene. , all the lying there motionless, us, and cess of relentlessly trying to get a rise, trick out of him,  his show pony, and maybe only need this in peace. I wonder if I won great day with that. wasn't quite the glorious lift or the plateau we've been holding for. But more of it gets the chance for us to openly confess our love and give us an odd acceptance. , when he was responding with hand signals and whatnot, he had X was , we could hold up the living well and ask him for yes or no. He said, I'm absolutely not. I scoped it hard the time, but I realized now how any man at this point lying at clamp down and he trapped animal burning medicine chasing him through things. and the mechanism is going to want desperately fight to the end. This is they say the soul is the last thing to leave the body. It will happen to be the first thing to flee in the situation, such as this. Not only for him, the clover of us. a crazy animal, this point the only thing is body has left all of his instinct and sanity. This becomes so hard to trust our attention because I wonder, we are not on the same course. The pulmonary doctor, young guy who looks sort of  a QVC fitness guru who charges in and get us a little pep talk. That's what's to keep it up. Don't worry about what the nurse is thinking.

She explains to me in her own kind of a weird way that the personable doc is at. And the ones with no personality are the ones you'd actually want operating them.

It seemed to us that no radio program about caregivers in a hospital could be complete without a few words about the caregiver that is the most omnipresent In every room 24 seven in the waiting rooms at the nurses station a lot of times Talking of course about television to investigate its power and a medical facility Reporter Nancy update went through the most television friendly hospital imaginable The one that actual television stars go to when they get sick see their son I am a interest. After staying at Cedar Sinai and seeing the quality of what was on the tube there, Milton Burl and Johnny Carson both donated old shows of theirs, broadcast in-house. Here's Nancy McCoy. This is how a lot of people feel about watching television and hospital. I should be a much better person and I should try to improve my mind while I'm here. But I just don't have patience for it. So I slip in to the degradation of this crap I would  to think that I'm the kind of person that could just turn it off and that it wouldn't affect me this is without the hollocks say I wasn't good any time But when I think about it if I Couldn't watch TV I'm not , I don't know I think that maybe I would go a little nuts These are two of the patients I talked to at Cedar Sinai the guy is Jay Mason a 74 year old with a nasty scar running from just under his atoms apple all the way down his chest. He's had a lot of heart surgery. The woman is Lashan Smith, who's been lying in the same uncomfortable position for almost a month. She's 31 and having her first baby, and she asked to stay in bed with her whole body angled head downwards so that her water doesn't break too soon. She'll stay in that position until the baby's born. She has three months to go. Let's be careful. our discussion, let's start here in this very hospital. So, okay, even if you've never actually been a patient in a hospital, you kind of already know what it's , right? There is no such thing as privacy. , people what going in, not in your room, looking at you, and peeking at you, just wonder what's wrong with you? Taking your temperature, taking blood. They wake me up early, continue vital signs and stuff, and I try to go back to sleep. We'll put you on the 5th, 30. The day goes very, very. very luxurious. having people to have to do everything for you and not being able to do things for yourself. you're meant for the day you get out of here. So let's summarize. You're sick, you're lonely, but also completely without privacy. You're exhausted, helpless, and you are so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, the culture of the hospital is divided into one group of people that is rushing around from a moment they walk in the door in the morning until the second they leave it. night and another group that is just languishing. No. And you and I are probably going to be in that second group, right? So we comfort ourselves and we're not too cheesy about how. Seven times in the morning. Once in the morning. You're not a Sally Diffy. What? I just... I just... I just... I'm not a friend here. I'm  anything. You're cooking, show up. Keep hard. Moisha, the Parker's, Malcolm and Eddie, I love seeing Black people. You want to tell a vision? Channel two, young and arrested. And then Channel seven, I'm on, and then Channel four, Aza Marla. So you're just a bad at talking here. You slept with your bad friends, man! It's almost as provocative in America. to say that television has therapeutic value, as it is to say that smoking pot does. We associate both with wayward teenagers, wasting their lives and rotting their brains, engaging in insidious activities  hanging out and chilling. But TV is so important to the patients at Cedar's Sinai that the woman who runs the video department there has been page at home on weekends and at night by I rate patients complaining about missing a ball game or a... because of some technical problem or programming change. One patient I talked to had even been so desperate to amuse herself that she hunkered down one day and became a world's leading expert on week-end ad burns. I think I'm gonna saw  four times a little sad a day, but that couldn't find anything else on them that I wanted to ask. Talk about making lemonade from lemons. What is this except the mind tenderly saying to the body? Listen. Don't you worry about me for a... while I'll take care of myself, you'll just focus on getting better. This is the life-changing lesson hospitals have to offer. TV is good for you. This is on the home of you imagine people before you still land hospital beds for days and weeks on the end and just stared at this wall and sometimes turned their head sideways and looked at that wall. That's horrendous. What? What are you doing? You can turn loose a little bit of fantasy in if it's junk, what the hell is it different? It's junk, so who cares? At least it's killing time. I guess I'm sort of arguing that in that sense it's not junk. Well, I think that you're right, and that sense it is not junk. That fills my own way of hours, and kind of gets me through the day. And that's a good thing. Outside the hospital, people call TV crap, because it's... anesthetic. Watching hours and hours of TV makes us feel spoiled, self-indulgent, no. But so what? I mean think about it. No became in morphine, make you feel numb too. And no one's calling them crap. Nancy update in Los Angeles. Coming up, an argument that Medicare payments should cover trips to pick up Bannon J. There is, and somebody actually likes staying in the hospital,  it's so much at a God or in trouble, it's on a minute, public radio and international, when our program continues. This is American Lyme from Eric Glass. These are the program of course which is a theme, bring your variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, Hospital Diplomacy, Stories of the Delicate, as an endless and delicate interaction of patients and hospital staff in a setting where lives are at stake. We have a live-dedact three of our show. So, that's three, fire and ice cream. This is story about how patients and medical staff actually can get along just fine. But how in that happens, it can still lead everybody involved scratching their heads with an answer to questions. About a decade ago, when Brent Ranjum was 14, he was burned badly enough that he ended up in children's national medical centers, burn unit, and Washington, D.C., burns covered 85% of his body. He put together this story about it with the help of radio producer Jay Alas. During the first weeks in the burn-yened, pain blurred from my wounds  air horns at a high school football game. I hated my body, I nerves, my brain, I wanted them all to just shut up. There were only a few times I wasn't in pain. Once before burn therapy, Tina my nurse pushed morphine straight into my bloodstream instead of dripping it through the IV. I asked her to push it. I begged her to let me feel it all at once to blow out my mind  an overexposed photograph. She did. For 30 seconds I couldn't feel my body, my vision was white-wash, and I understood why someone would want to be an addict. When I could talk again I mumbled. Why don't they sell this stuff on the streets? They could make a fortune. Tina unwrapped my bandages exposing my legs to the air. I looked down. It didn't look  the legs at all. They were skinny and useless. So many shades of purple they didn't even look real. I saw the massive wound as big as a mailbox on my left thigh where the fire had burned out of my throat. Tina saw me looking, leaned over and whispered, but she always said, It's okay. It's going to get better. Redness means that it's healing. I closed my eyes and braised myself for what was coming next. She began by cleaning each open wound on my feet, working up to my thighs, and then she would turn me on my stomach to clean the holes on my back. The pain ward from my legs is she cleaned the first wound. Tina explained that my body was healing, and that healing was one of the most painful things of body. do. She said that pain man I was getting better. Didn't feel  I was getting better. My skin was tissue paper and she was tearing at it with steel wall. She told me that if I had hurt too much that I should scream as loud as I could and at first I didn't want to, I thought it would be rude or disruptive and that I could just close my mind to the pain if I tried. But she said that I should scream when that was some of a pain. And so she cleaned everyone three times. I screamed and it became a kind of waltz. The Tina counting their swipes allowed and me screaming 1, 2, 3, scream 1, 2, 3, scream After she covered me in gauze and a bandages my body was shivering I was exhausted crying a little bit Trying not to think about how I'd have to do it all over again in eight hours Tina stood at the head of my bed her thick black curls spiral torn my face Brand she said Think all the basins would have been ten feet or never That guy's scream seemed  a silly question since I was still getting fed through a tube in my nose. When you get that nose to about, when you can walk again, I'm going to take you to the best ice cream shop in DC. It had been a week since I had eaten anything and I hadn't even thought about ice cream. Couldn't believe it. Tina and I would go out for ice cream and I could walk. We would go on a date. It was eight weeks later and it was going to be my first time outside the burning unit. What's the pain of God? been replaced by the itch. Anyone who's ever had a burn can tell you that the itch comes after the pain and that it sometimes worse because it's constant. It made me feel  the skin on my body didn't belong to me as if it had been stripped away in my sleep and replaced with raw wool. I prepared for hours for my date with Tina. My mom and another nurse named Barbara picked out the looses, least eartain and clothing, and they helped me into a pair of baggy athletic pants and a hard rock cafe London T-shirt that my mom said looked really cool. They discussed whether I should wear the pressure bandage that masked part of my face, and then Barbara slipped the chin strap off of my head and velcroed it behind my neck. He put a purple Los Angeles Lakers cap on me to cover part of the bandage. They both said that I looked handsome. I didn't look in a mirror. Finally, Tina came to pick me up for her date. She had taken up her scrubs and put on a loose white sweater. Her functional shoes were replaced with green all stars and she was wearing shorts. I'd never seen her in shorts before. She looked so good. laks, not  a nurse at all. She smiled at me from the doorway. As a burn nurse in a children's hospital, Tina rarely had patients that she could talk to. Most of the kids she could care of with two URLs, kids that could walk long enough to pull boiling water down from the stove, but couldn't understand that wasn't her fault that they were in pain. Those kids hated her for hurting me. They panicked every time she came near them, but I knew the pain wasn't her fault. I talked to her and we immediately checked her lap. Could have 26. Sir old burners be interested in our 14-year-old patient. I was in love with Tina and I was sure that she was at least a little bit in love with me too. I also would take me out on the date that she had called it a day. Why else would she wear shorts or green shoes? A clear sign to a 14-year-old boy that says, go, go, go. We waited for the elevator next to a hospital directory sign and I decided to make my first joke. Cleared my throat and said, spine abyphidd. That sounds  some sort of grief. six-foot, ten a minute face and said, you wouldn't say that if you knew what it was. The elevator door is open. Walking out of the hospital with Tina made me feel  I was on a real date, although I'd never been on a date before. Something about being on my own feet, walking into the fresh air, the afternoon sunlight, a woman next to me, a woman who had I reminded myself, already seen me naked. By the time we got to the car, I was exhausted, sweating from the few remaining points. In my forehand armpits, the inch which had been mercifully quiet during the first few minutes on her date started buzzing in my legs. Tina must have noticed that I was uncomfortable because she put the back of her hand. No rubber glove, her actual hand against my forehand, and wiped the beating sweat away. Where did that mean I wanted to do my so? Tina parked about a block away from the ice cream place she'd been telling me about, got out of the car and rushed around to my side, dope in the door. That's sweet I thought, wish I'd done that for her. She helped me onto my feet. and we began walking towards the ice cream place. You okay, she asked? Sure, I said, you. I was trying to ignore the edge that had spread up my legs and into my back. I was walking. That was the important thing. And I was on the date. Inside, the cool air dried the sweat on my forehead, and I began to feel more comfortable. I thought I'd have a sigh of relief just to let her know that the worst was over, and that we would start to have fun in any second. We stood in line behind a few senior citizens that were deciding between. Pistachio and Butterpercon, I smiled at her and rolled my eyes a little as if to say, Can you believe who's old people? There's so slow. And she smiled back. This is working, this is real work. It was then that I saw the ice cream guy checking Tina out from behind the counter. It was college age, handsome. I knew what he was thinking. We stepped up to the counter and I prepared myself for this learning. And then he looked at me in a smile dropped into it. expression of mock pain, as he said. Ouch! What happened to you? As soon as he said it, I thought the blood clueling my legs in the edge throughout all of my body. I backed up a little, stepped away from the counter. I looked down at my feet, I put my hands in my pockets, I didn't want to talk to him anymore. I didn't want to say anything. Tina finally broke the spell and asked me what kind of ice cream I wanted. It was all I could do to mumble chocolate. My head still cast down, we're studying the tile patterns. I asked her if we could eat it. me to the Maccar on the way back to the hospital. She said that we could. On the way home, I reached up and touched the lung purple star on my cheek. I pinched the edge and blanched it right between my fingers. The sky was numb on my cheek. Lightbliss and heart,  a lot of gum under a school desk. Thanks to ice cream guy, I realized that redness didn't mean I was human anymore. It meant that I was disfigured. I understood that I wasn't going to get much better. Despite all the reassuring. things Tina had said to me in the bringing it. This was it. Ice cream boy saw me for what I was. Scard. All I wanted then was to go back to the hospital. I wanted to climb into my mechanical bed and watch Regis and Kathy leave for the rest of my life. I wanted to eat Chucky pudding and flirt with the nurses. I wanted to be able to scream. When we got back to the hospital, Tina walked me to the elevator. We wrote up to the third slot. We had to say. anything on the ride back. She never asked me how I liked the ice cream, which is good because I wouldn't have known what to set. Right before the doors opened, she put her hand on my forehead. I looked at her and she said, good night beautiful. And I walked back to the burning, the safest place in the world. Still pretty I'm a professionalαher's lover. And I'm a nurse and I worked at Children's National Medical Center in Washington DC for about eight years as a burn nurse there. How old must it the kids who were there? Well, primarily the kids that we saw there were toddlers because children have dinner skin than adults do, so an injury, a couple coffee from a microwave with severely burn a young child, and there is for you it might make me. to spread this in a media blister. Okay, as you said, it's a picture in a little kid's scam, where you can see all the capillaries in the surface. You can see the blood moving through it in a way where... This is much thinner. That you weren't going to hurt eight years? Mm-hmm. How often would you take a patient to go and get ice cream? Once, at eight years. Really? That I should say here that you are the nurse in Brent's story. And we tracked you down. You look at her in Chicago now. And up. I'm surprised to hear that he was the only one. Somehow when I heard his story, I thought, oh, this is a nurse who, , it's some point in her arsenal of tricks to help a kid keep a good attitude and get better. , she'll just do the ice cream thing at some point. No. I wanted to do something for him. I wanted to do something outside the hospital with him. Why? Why? Because he was just here, I developed a very strong bond. over those few months we spent  our work stayed during the day so I was there doing most of the waking hours The one thing too that was so special about print was that he was an adolescent I Identified I was so very young I was in my early 20s mid 20s which was very young and It can't help but build the ill I would say something but it is sceptre but I thought sorry for her, I really did. And so I wanted to do something and make you find that her. She must have been strange when you took him into the outside world and then there are the two of you and you're not in your nurses uniform and he's not the patient and there you are. Feeling  I was a positive protectant and feeling very uncomfortable with it because you can't record her met with people. were going to say or had they were going to look at him and I couldn't control how he was going to feel. And on these trips do you remember noticing other people reacting to brands and him noticing them reacting? Oh, certainly. I remember the ice cream shop and particularly even the people who worked in the ice cream shop staring at him and I remember being just really nervous that someone might say something that would really hurt his feelings or stare. for a prolonged period of time or have some strange expression or something from seeing him? The thought must have flashed through your mind at some point when you were out with him that maybe he thought of this as a date. Even though he was only 14, it never really, I didn't think of it that way out. It was just a really special friendship and bond that I had with him. But I didn't think of it that way. I don't know if he'd think of it that way. I think of it, yes, and he's a little bit more maybe. Really, obviously a flattered. He, wow. I hope that was in some way beneficial to him to think that an older woman with him. and maybe that helped someone in his with his self-imension. I hope that led to some point back to him if he hears that it wasn't that way, but it doesn't mean that I didn't care about an endless, it's just very different. when you think about becoming a nurse, I would imagine in the picture in your had is going to be caring for people and helping them through this really hard time. And part of that picture must be that certain people you're going to close to and you really help them and be this person for them. How often you get to feel them connection? I mean, would you actually accomplish it every day? No. You don't. A reality you don't, you don't make those cabins on it. I can think back of all the children I took here of and there was probably you and the children. And I remember. is thinkally probably twin of those thousand in that eight years. And again, that was a special place because it was all children and it was place we had such great resources and wonderful people. It seems  because back then, resources for healthcare were , it is named. So it was kind of  an ideal world in it. Every time I think back, oh, I wish I had that kind of job again. But that doesn't exist anymore. You're saying literally , places  that don't exist. I just can't find it if it's about there. This is just 10 years ago or something. It changed that much. So dramatically different. It just turns even of staffing today because there's such restraints, issues with money. It seems as if staff are coming in opposition with administration. and hospital, it just does a scene cohesive. Back then, it was just, , the whole hospital it just felt this cohesiveness. And at the back, it's very different. In fact, the burn unit doesn't exist there anymore. Things are so different, they are going to be used to be. I remember thinking that something had changed in America when I saw this movie that was not a very good movie . It called as Good as It Gats. Last year, it was Jack, Jack Nicholson, and how much in it, how in it? And also almost no one's ever realized about that. happen in America if you can have a movie and the heroic thing that the guy does is get the kid off the HMO and get him to a private doctor. that's the heroic act. Right, it was incredible right. -huh. Kind of  seeing the class. Well, no,  people clap. It was , what has happened in this country that  it's  getting somebody out of regular healthcare can be , did you see this movie? Sure, I've seen it  two or three times. And did it strike you too? , was the fact that , what's going on here? For me, it wasn't, , so maybe because I know. That is a big deal. So I have was , who cares? , okay, fine. The guy got to the kick out to get to see a bit that. I was gonna say one more thing. I remember when I would do Brits' room care, I felt  because it was difficult to make an emotional detachment oftentimes. I felt  I didn't do very good job doing that because it was hard to push myself to do something I knew was going to hurt him so badly. I'm not sure that was necessarily too as benefit. I'm not saying it costs him any harm, but it was difficult to be. Is such a succ değildi. that even now when you think that it, you worry that you went too far and got too close. At Alton, when there if that was beneficial to me at that time, , it made my life, it didn't make my life easy. When I talked to Brad, he told me, he asked me, when you talked to him just recently, when I talked to him just recently, he was telling me that what he had in the story that he had met, and he basically said, one of his big questions he The line has been wonder what the heck I was doing when I left his bed sign. Why is it she in here? I'm going through all this pain that I'm totally alone so much to be with me. Why is it she in here? What is she doing? And it was a part for me to get away too. After I had been through that with him, I needed to kind of cleanse myself to get myself together. That's a very difficult thing for me to go through too. Do  what I mean? The effect you're, you're, you sound  you can just shut it off and you come home. You're supposed to be able to, and most of the time you came in, but in a situation that, is a possible. But in a way, you think that the governor should want to have you want the nurse who, who would be, if I could buy it outside the hospital. You would, if it were you, if it were me. You're saying from a nurse perspective, it's too much to ask a person to do. It's too much to ask a nurse to do. Is it, is it, is it, is the help you're providing you have to be able to? have your own life for you good nerds. Idiot. You have to be one separate. Tina Bobo. Brennan Street was produced by Jay Allison as part of his live story series and helped him pristine at Eggwap and funding from Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Now I think, choose to roam and instead, I'm falling down, standing up and blowing up and down. Who gets been can't come to rest, I'm damaged by a habit, chill beside the wall. I promise we'll be the last to know. No one says in delicious, see how it is and watch or they tell. See you. I'm back for looking for love in all the wrong places. So what have you done to bathe rules and customs at the hospital? When do you do her has this story of one woman who did over and over, disabated rules and what happens now? The first time Wendy Scott went into a hospital, she was 15, she had her appendix out, and she was surprised how much she enjoyed it. This was back in our hometown of Wenez Bay, Scotland. I enjoyed it when the Nazis were coming, Slaw thought my pillars and asked me how I was, how was the night, , sure a little bit that they cared, which is something I never really had at home. A year later, feeling depressed and a love. working at a holiday camp on the east coast of Scotland. She got the idea to walk herself into an emergency room and tell them that she was feeling sick when she wasn't. I knew I wasn't sick. But I wanted somebody to care about me. They kept me in a few days. They did a few blood test a few X-rays. Said you're fine, you can go home. For a long time, that was all it. was which suited me. I mean they took me into hospital, they cared about me, they gave me the attention I wanted, if you liked they reached out my batteries and I was able to go back out and face the world and I'm trying to be normal again for a while. In the same way that prison came to the best place to learn how to become a better criminal, in hospitals when do learn how to become a better inward? Over time, she came up with her own set of rules. Number 1. Always pause after the doctor asks you a question. It makes it look  you're thinking about the answer. Number 2. Never change your story. Number 3. When all else fails, tell the doctor you have a stomach ache. The can't prove you down. And stomach pain can be 100 different. Thanks. Number four. Listen closely to what the doctor says. He'll tell you everything you need to know. Drs told me most of what I knew. I mean, I would go into the emergency room, seeing I've got stomach ache. And they would examine me. And then they'd say, have you got clones disease? No, what's clones disease? And then they'd tell you all about clones disease. effects people face and of course you align the artisan always in. Where do you find the next time you might want to use it? Fundy claims to have been a patient 850 times at over 650 different hospitals all over Europe and Great Britain. It's hard to confirm these stats. There's nearly all our hospital visits were registered under different names. She'd randomly chosen out of the phone book. What she had was a psychological disorder called munchazz and syndrome. People with this syndrome could extremely measures, pretending to be sick, just to get attention. In its shocking, how successful some of them can be. There are cases of people having amputations of one or more limbs, performed by doctors who believed they were ill. I mean, I thought... 42 abdominal operations on my stomach. And I never want you to but if I've gone to hospital and the doctor comes and says, he doesn't know what's causing the stomachache and maybe he better have a loop and see. If I see no, he's going to wonder why I don't want to find out what's causing this pain and I'm supposed to have and so you go away. I hate it and you have the operation. Sometimes during the operation the staff would realize she was faking it, and then she would be stuck in the hospital recovering from her surgery with everyone knowing she lied. Twice she was even sent to prison charged with illegally obtaining drugs food and lodging. The hospital  any other ecosystem has a set of rules, and there are certain rules you simply can't break and survive in the system. For 12 years when you lie to doctors in nurse. and shuddled from hospital to hospital. It was also did with her life between the ages of 16 and 28. She never held a job or had any close relationships. It was just too risky. As a result, her name and photo were permanently included on hospital blacklist all over the UK and Europe. Hospital blacklist are illegal here in the US, but not in countries with nationalized health plans. Finally, when she actually got her wish and needed hospitalization. She couldn't get medical care. About 18 months ago, she started to feel a pain in her groin while she was driving. I saw a surgeon and he, I really caught me at her end of his head. He couldn't feel a lump of groin and this was for the pain I had in my stomach. Well, that was paining from my past and I just had to put up with me. Paining from my past and I just sat there in tears. She finally got medical attention through a doctor she'd met on the internet a couple of years ago. Dr. Mark Feldman is an expert on Munchath's syndrome, and Wendy contacted him through his website after she started a Munchath's support group in London. Two and a half years and a hundred emails later, they were friends. Wendy phoned him this past summer for advice about this pain she'd been having. So Dr. Feldman invited her to his hospital. When the doctors went into her abdomen, they said. spent about two hours just cutting through the scar tissue that had resulted from all those abdominal procedures she had had in the past. But once they had done that they found what they described as a tumor of the size of a small soccer ball. People lie in all sorts of institutional settings, in schools, at their jobs, on loan applications at banks. But most of us don't. lie in hospitals. And it's not because we're worried about wasting hospital resources or humiliating doctors. We don't lie in hospitals because it's just too frightening. We worry there'll be mortal consequences. And in Wendy Scott's case, there were. Because she violated the rules of medicine. She couldn't get care for 18 months. And in that time, the cancer spread to the point where there was nothing that could be done to save her. Though doctors told her she had two years to live. She'd add this far, just a month after I was in every. I'm not proud of what I did. In that I spent an in thousands of poems. We steered, I'll split all tame and money. But I couldn't help it. It was something I had to do. I just didn't know I didn't know any other way to to get somebody to care. And although it wasn't exactly the kind of caring I wanted, it was better than the new caring at all. So you accept. And in the end, Wendy got over her attachment to hospitals. When her illness got more advanced, and she could have spent her remaining days on a ward, she instead chose to leave the hospital and spend the rest of her days at home. That's story on Wendy Doer.
