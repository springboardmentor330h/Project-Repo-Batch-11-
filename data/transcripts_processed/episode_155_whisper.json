In China, 14, we love watching this British TV show, so it's running on PBS, masterpiece theater, Dr. Hube. And then there was this show that I would stay up for a late and watch, you take watch, you're going to begin the stage, 12th, MC and make peace. Which was about a merit detective who went to London because he had been  set up at home and used team W. a woman who was this aristocratic with Lady Harriet Makeings. And I was really on her side. She's got you down on the mirror. Oh yeah. But Charlie liked about Lady Harriet make these. And all the other grits of TV was their atleastings. Have they seemed above at all? Have they looked down on Americans? Which Sean did also? It would be something wrong with the nation that produced Jackson Bowies and Horace. school. And sometimes, joking around with his friends, we'll talk with British accent. And then it was just something that spiraled out of control. I know that eventually I was just using an accent literally on waking the same morning moon in night. Sean spoke with the British accent from the time he was 14 until he was 16. And at some point, his mother took into the sea as psychiatrist. He was just really, he must, I don't know, in a different school of psychology. But he was really very confronted. He was , well, , you've got to stop doing that since he said to his, because you're not British. , and my mom, my mom just sat over the next and she, she's one. Yeah, to agree with him. So, I was helping to show him this. cuid Acne 연습s Adam зна Ye Represent F comprehend The Be Even So and then posted a lecture to guide on how in fact he was British. And the only problem with that was A, he knew very well that he was not. And B, his mother was sitting right there to assure the conflict. It all just seemed impossible. Because that's what I was thinking. , there has to be a way that I can be British still. There must be a way that this is true somehow. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well today on our radio program, stories of people who tell a lie and they get to the point that they believe a lie more than anyone else does. In other words, stories of people playing hoaxes on themselves. WB EZCHKAGO, Public Radio International, this American life, I'm Eric Glass. At one of our program today, the Sun never sets on the Moosewood Restaurant, in which to young man, both. some small towns, try on new identities, false identities, and what they have to do to keep the lies going. Act 2, Conning the Conmin, Nancy Optic reports on a federal sting operation, and how it caught Conmin by setting up a con of its own. Act 3, app performing the performers. A girl gets her big break on Broadway, but going into a coma. Stay with us. I Quarne, the son never sets on the muswood restaurant. This is the story of two young people who, for a period in their lives, in their search to figure out who they were, pretended to be people who they were not. We're here from Sean Cole and Joe Lovall, starting with Sean. He grew up in a small town in Massachusetts, town that was approximately 3,350 miles from London. It was a second-hater. It was first-nature. It was, , I, to this day I have... probably saying, oh, I baked an accent. So I mean, I had an accent for two years. So I , so I'm correct. So I just got to take a deep breath and describe for me what you had for lunch today. Perhaps for breakfast this morning. In is close to the accent that you can. As close as I can. Yeah. Well, I'm , I had a seven. I had it at the Boston House of Pancakes. There are pizza, rather. What was the beverage? It was saying, yes, snap-o. And you just lemon-flavored. I don't want to go to the beach. Joe Lovell's straight-and-hand. He got the working-class town when he grew up in the state of New York. His parents had a liquor store in the small town. He was the first member of his family to go to college. And it was especially a big deal because it got into an Ivy League school. Right now, it was one of those, , those first days of college, , when you spent a lot of time, everybody kind of moves and hoards, you spend a lot of time in each other's dorm rooms. And there was, , they were about, oh, I don't know, ten or eleven of us in this one guy's room. And we were just  sitting around, eating pizza and talking, and people were talking about what they were, , where they were from and what their, what their parents did and stuff  that. There was one guy who's dad was a doctor for the next. There was another guy who's father was an elected representative from New York State. And then this other guy who's father was on the World Court. Literally was a member of the World Court. So suddenly he seemed  this incredibly impressive group to me. It's just sort of worldly in ways that, , there's just the on my wildest imagination. And , we're a free on, , what I mean. I'm now, frankly. And I remember sitting at the time thinking, oh, my God, I'm so out of my meat here. And then completely unplanned, I suddenly said, as a slice of pizza was passed, I mean, that sort of pizza was sausage on top. And then I said, I can't take that because my parents are vegetarians. And then every in the room, because sort of turned and looked at me, because it wasn't even a stuff. Well, , I'm a vegetarian. said, , my parents are vegetarian. And this is sort of puzzled look on everybody in the play and in the room and I said, well, no, and I am too, , I've never eaten. And I'm not in tight well, I have some ideas now about why I said that, but at the time I had no idea what I was saying. It was , , suddenly I had become possessed. And I had to think of something to say about myself, it seemed interesting. And in vegetarianism, I was the, was the thing I chose. Now, did you tell people that you were actually flimped England? No. No. Never thought I was frumbring, but in a way that I was British, , there was a real distinction there for me. , I, , I'd taken it on. I was cultural and criminal. Well, I think what it was is, I think I did some sort of calculus that took  a nanosecond in my head. And I thought I can't actually lie about what my parents do. Alright, thank you. the connections that I was making were this. It somehow, because I was from this town, this disk. If my folks were vegetarian, then the whole history that that suggested was that there were some, these kind of leftists, academic, radicals, who had sort of dropped out of society and gone back to the land and I was living this. Pumped the town and upstate New York, and my folks were living some sort of life that was driven by their political philosophy, rather than, I was just a guy who grew up in. It would stay peored. , I did the old kid thing of  wishing that my real British parents would come and tell me I was adopted and take me back to London. So I'm sitting there in the room and all these guys that look at Abby and they're , dude, , what do you eat? And suddenly I realized, I realized in that moment how little I knew about vegetarianism. And I kind of tried to be real sort of vague about, , we salads and lentils, I remember sort of saying lentils a lot. , I'm... And there was a gap certainly in my education, because I would be using words that Americans just don't use, instead of saying drugstore, I would say chemist or I would try my best to remember to say, , bond it instead of hood or boot instead of trunk, but I often... On the meal plan, I ended up eating a lot of big piles of iceberg lists and chickpeas. And during that time, would you... find yourself sneaking to get meet some. Yeah, definitely. At first I would go really far from campus in order to go to have  a BLT. There was this signar down town in Africa and it was, , you could felt incredibly illicit. I'd be sitting there and I'd have some reading material or something with me. I'd be the lonely guy in my booth. And I would order the BLT and I would. and watch it kind of coming from a cross through, , with its toothpick and the top of it. And a side of french fries with the meat gravy on top. And it would just, , when I landed on a table, it would just see, you might just see incredibly, , sort of wonderful moment, , when you're doing something just totally, unlike what I'm wearing. I was no but, , I mean, I was living in a extremely small, kind of rural. and  where it was I guess in a way  this was my way of traveling in a way and being somebody and sort of of achieving an identity which I guess I didn't feel  I had  I didn't feel I I just sort of relicated myself but I guess I didn't feel as though I had anything that made me up I mean, what I realized fairly quickly is that if this is going to be believable, I actually have to , well, well, I have to believe in it. But I also began to not only believe, but really sort of take on as my persona, all of the stuff that I imagine was associated with this sharing. So  what? Well, , certain certain political convictions and, , ways of dress, I wore ripped jeans and I wore combat boots, but I also wore  a kind of stage jacket that you would see in a community theater production of Hamlet. But yeah, I bought the Sentels. Very specifically, I remember buying down to the thrift store and down to the gun and buying a pair of them. F� shorts, which just seemed , , I might as well have been shaked away early. Sorry, I mean as far as I was concerned, I was, yeah, I was dangerous leftist. , did you at any point during this find yourself following all of my, or, you would say I've never had an error in somebody who did cyst, oh, you must, some point. And then you had to argue your side. Yeah, definitely. It was, it wasn't pretty. , and of course, , I had grown up. I'm just, just put this in. context for a second. If you don't mind, I mean not only did I had hundreds of hand burgers and gone to McDonald's drive through hundreds of times, but the counterpoint situation I always think about when I remember the time was that when I was a senior in high school, my family for a sort of time saving reasons decided that what a great thing to do would be to go to RB's roast B, I don't know if he have his wife on the morning, so my And Dad and I would go to Arby's, say,  it. There's a number here, something here. We got it in school. And we would go in there, and we would buy 48 Arby's first few sandwiches. And they would put it with this cardboard, with this cardboard, and we would bring home, we would bring home this giant box, whole of those tin foil covered, Arby's first few sandwiches. And we would stuff them in Arby's fridge, or in our freezer. We would freeze the Arby's first few sandwiches. And then we would happen there. We would fold them. Good job! Blund's buns in all, yeah, and so we have them there is ready made snacks Whenever we went well, and I'm that's kind of eating that my family was The other things that I have these run-ins With doubting my British identity  really yeah as though it was slipping away and I would happened at home, I was , oh my gosh, do something happy with firm my lotion. So I think I know I opened up the window and I psyched myself to do it. I was , oh man, if I don't do this, , if I want the back, open up the window and I, I  my screen, it's no, I'm not working on 10 in 9. I love England. I love England. And of course, I'm a person. Outside the window. -huh. And then you thought better, you felt  you were really certain. I felt  I had done some. something in the East. Floor England. Yeah, I had I had four to five my my British nest. I would find myself in the same. In his conversation people were saying never had from the old town. But we were what kind of American. 18 year old America has never had a hamburger from the Donuts. Quite a legitimate question. Absolutely absolutely. And I was, yeah, no. I just never had one. I had one of these scare me and I was sort of . talk about the ways and I would make up these stories about how I'd come close a couple of times how friend of mine high school and Bob came big man and there I was sitting on the front seat of his car I almost ate it couldn't bring my seat to do it so yet it's also from a very similar way my mom that came down to him came down to visit for parents weekend And they were really proud that I was going there. And really excited to come down. They came down to visit. And really proud because you were the first generation to go to college, you were right. This idea of schools, big, big, big, big, big, right example. Exactly. And so they drove down from the list, which is about between an hour and an hour and a half, they came down. And in that weak leading up to parents, weak and everybody's talking about their parents coming, and they're basically making reservations of restaurants, and we're going to eat a set. And everybody's sort of planning on taking parents to the football game on the same Saturday during the day. And it's suddenly occurred in this real sort of panic setting that my parents would come to have fun and we would go to a football game in my dad with my hot dog. And , when somebody's thinking across the field would see you still level eating hot dog. , then of course the cat would be out of the bed. And so I thought, , I've got to make a reservation at the restaurant at some place either A where nobody else's parents will be or at or at a vegetarian restaurant. And so what I did was make a reservation at the Moosewood restaurant, which is in it the good. , there's that Moosewood cookbooks that are out and vegetarian cookbooks. Exactly. And this is nice, a little vegetarian restaurant, yeah, good. And this is slightly famous place. But then we got there and  I remember sitting down at the table and so and and  the bulls or these kind of carved wooden bulls and everything about it feels  well let me know the best area. That's the vegetarian restaurant but kind of a cartoon of it. Exactly. Exactly. And  and I was looking at my parents across the table and they were. They were dressed up and they were excited to be coming down. And I could tell  my dad was sitting there, sort of cruising the menu and thinking, well, , maybe this lentil salad will be good. Or whatever. And I could tell he was sitting there. She was just going to be , I want to have all I want. It's steak, a big potato in her beer, . And there I was bringing them here. But they were so game about it. So it was sort of willing to go along with it because some reason they thought. I really want to bring them there. And such as, , these people, these people, my parents, , have really  given up a lot from to come financially. They were really stretching themselves and we were taking out, so it's flawless. No, those things, that people do what they would call it. , they never complained once about doing it. And they just wanted to come down and see me there and feel proud that I was there. And I was sort of hiding around the session. I felt so bad about it afterwards. And they never once come right. They went home and I'm imagining that guys are the men. They're stopping at our hearty, it's just as I did. They're getting up for a hair as soon as they say goodbye. But after that I just thought she's not gonna find something to it. It's a complete promise. I mean, is it okay if your child decides to express himself in an alternate personality for a period of two years? I think there's funny, I never thought I would say this, but I think there's nothing wrong. I never thought I would say it because I think that's because I wish that I hadn't done it now. But, no, maybe I'll learn something from doing it. I think that that is, , far for the court. that's hard. Now I think that's harder growing up. I think it was, it was probably necessary for me to get that time in my life. Because it gave you confidence. Yeah. And there was some bridge that this, that, that, that, this, be another, this allowed you to cross. Joe Lv. and Sean Cole. Joe Guffell is the Executive Editor of Hotcast Company Club. Apple Street India Shawn Cobb works public radio did he does this one produces about the ground that gay shop Platine on your play was mod a eraz song Thank you for your advice. I too, counting the cond man. The American legal system for the most part is not a political advice  on. If you still somebody's part, the police do not steal your card. The catch is selling marijuana. They do not sell marijuana to you as you personally. But if you're in the business of running scams, a party's catch you by running a scam on you. This is the story of a con man who made millions by following people of a phone until he was left with him. And as you have to record, the guy's name is David Diamond. That's his actual name. He was one of the most successful salesmen in one of the longest running telemarketing scams in Los Angeles history. David Diamond was salesman out of boiler room. This is Dels. He's been a federal trade commission investigator for 29 years. He's the one who busted diamond. He was living in very expensive home. When the Gilles and Woodland Gilles, he drove a custom horser carera that he had shipped over here by airplane from Germany in the factory. They lived very high on the farm. David Diamond was just one of a whole bunch of guys making money hand over fist. In an operation in Southern California that was beefed. basically running the same scam over and over under different names for seven years. It was an investment scheme. Give us your money and we'll put it into this great 900 number business or this online shopping network or this hot new internet service provider. Needless to say, no one ever made a dime, except that people running the scam, cleared 40 million dollars. Since Diamond was one of the operations top salesmen, he made $2 million in emissions in just four years. job. He got 30% of whatever he talked to person into invest. That means he personally con people out of more than $6 million. The FTC caught time in the others in the operation, essentially by conning the connet. They had volunteers, pose is dupes, and record their phone calls. Because the FTC brought a case against the operation time and worked in, some of those recordings are now part of the public record. I got Dale Sucovic to listen to the tapes with me. and talk about David Diamond and the FBI volunteer caught it. The woman on the tape I can't tell you real name, but she uses the alias March. She assumed the identity of the person who is named March. March was a real person who we in law first and people tell Mark and business before she was in the age. March is someone who essentially by anything from anybody who calls her. on telecom. In fact, she did for a number of years. She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. There we are, March. We are March. It's been hundreds of thousands of dollars on bogus, prize promotion, investments, coal coins, you name it. So the FBI went to March and said, we really think that we need to take the telephone number away from them because it's been used to work. you're life. So once March agreed to that, her telephone number was installed in the home of an FBI volunteer. And that volunteer, every time that phone line rang, the March line, that volunteer, they pick up that telephone answer that closed as March. March, March, at David Diamond Hill I'm a king. Yeah. I picked up a video and a package. I have it. Okay. Video is with regards to Mark Erickson. Mark Erickson is the person who is heading up to his program. And he is very successful in taking up stock companies and making them successful. You probably heard of hard copies. You heard of original producing hard copies. I heard on the end. You're smiling. and listen to this, what are you smiling about? Well, I'm smiling because I've been a while since I heard her talk. She sounds so old and so fragile and such an easy mark. When it's back to , she's this sharp FBI informant. She doesn't look as old as she sounds, trust me. So that's one aspect of it. The other aspect is this whole mark, Eric's. Yeah, it's here real person. Mark, Eric's is a real person. You use names in our office. And... Was he an original producer of hard copy? He was a executive producer on here, a quarter for hard copy for Bruce Kulian. And I mean, is this sort of typical of the cons in the tapes that he's heard that they'll try to associate what they're selling with a legitimate business or organization or television show, something that people have heard of. The camera would be re △ I mean, there's some seconds already, are there really any? And again, the opening system says- something variable is manual, so it obviously feels  you're everything. When you dah up, if you'll ever hear, by rhetor motherboard overload, there's something that's not set in the jakby. All what sense. want to make this something to relate to. Here's the thing, well, your house is that everything you've got or do nothing at all. And I'll say that again, you should address everything you have. You should transfer all your inductance in this program or do nothing. It doesn't make sense to just a little bit. You should think about doing a million dollars in this program. Oh! I don't know! That's what I'm . You need to liquidate every nickel you got into one of the situations. You need to one of the situations all hard-laced and upgrade your investment force or result. My test needs to be the whole thing. Well, I would never liquidate everything I have. My question is why not? Because there's always examples in anything  that. Anything  what? Well, in this practice,  this. I want to ask you, do you tell me once that you thought he sounded nervous on this tape? And in this part where she's saying, , an investment  this and he's sort of the question, what do you mean  this? I wonder, is, do you have any sense that he's suspicious that she might know what he's up to? I mean, do they know that volunteers are out there trying to... Trapped them, posing his dudes. Now since we talked about this tape last, actually sort of have a revelation that came from the universe to why. I listened to over 40 in which he takes a game of dying. Compensation with margin, conversations and partners. So of course, we're out of here. And one of the things when you listen to all of them, find that David sort of early, early, your part of that. year was much more kind of sweet and cautious kind of bond with these women in patients and sometimes there's been an hour-up fall with them to be an hour-long but this tape was made for the very end that you can create probably this end a week or two having gotten on-graving and searched David Dines desk that came to realize that David Dines has started to question David Dines. He was starting to really have concerns about moral and what they would do. I believe that in these last couple of weeks. It's kind of shown at this tape. He was becoming a little bit desperate. He wanted to make a couple of more big hits And just couldn't figure out why this woman wasn't gonna run the check So he started getting It comes out What evidence did you see that he was starting to have moral clums about what he used to David had become a boy There were legit straps on I don't know, that we have time. We do know that he had given a lot of the money that he had made to his church. And we believe that a lot of that was sort of self-host penance that he just defy was giving his guidance. This money that he was taking from his Provectorms into his church. If $30,000 worth of money on every $5,000 dollars, and you put $50,000 dollars in program, that $300,000 dollars insurance. That's why I tell you you need to deal with millions of dollars in program. I don't know. I would never put that much in any program. Passover continues. you thought that's not that, is making most of the body parts. Well,  what my age is really, not that. Well, I want to say, I haven't actually ever done. For the rest of my life, I have this question. But if it still is your best, is it makes the most of my body parts and will be trying to do it as a place we've talked about. Ah, that's my obligation not to lose what I have to rest. But of course, we obviously can probably work with the body parts. Right, and all the right. And I heard this part of the tape, even though I knew that this woman, this particular woman, was not getting caught, but she was in fact, caught in him and trapping him. I started to get so angry because I was thinking, , he is really trying to take all of this old woman's money. She's saying, I have enough to live on. He's saying, you have an obligation to make. more. Do you have our here things  that and just get angry even though  that she's sort of in on the on the con on the joke? Every time I hear these pitches, I'm out of range. Because I, a person that spoke to people who really did send David Diamond tensed thousands of dollars that consisted of their life savings. And now don't have in mind. this. And interview. I've seen saw. Yeah. And what sort of recourse do they have? Okay. Slim and none. Slim. Slim. We have public companies that want to make you public. Yeah. So you got a public company. If Mark Eric wants to do this with his own even in talking in the front, if he's really making an afternoon for this. And it doesn't make sense not to have every make we have got in a particular program. That's why I said, if the monthly investment is the way to do it, at least, they do it 100, 100, 50 units. Why have the opportunity? Well, how much are you investing in there? I know that's the beginning of this. Okay. My investment comes with my client. Yeah. Right. In fact, when they make money, they reinventlessly. Right. -huh. That's the old point. -huh. You were smiling again. When she said, how much are you investing? Minisheet just screwing around with him? Of course, I'm saving. Yeah. I mean, she's trained to ask him those kinds of questions. Please so that he responds with a different situation. But that doesn't sound  it's part of the script. That just sounds  her being me and sort of a, no, sure with delicious way. Well, no, I think what we were trying to do or Hitler was trying to be is dead her to make him say, oh, yeah, I've got my mother and my grandmother in it. And I'm putting away money for my child's education with it because of which she'll later that he had. Did you ever talk to March about what it's  to do this? Do they ever have fun just thinking, I'm just turning the tables on this guy, he has no idea. I wish I could answer the question, I've never spoken to them. I'd love to get the answer to that, I'd  to ask them. I think they get a lot of questions in the sense. How often do you get a chance to catch a bad guy? just a regular civilian. Yeah. , I do it too. I take using an A-Wayis in cases that I work. And is it fun? I love it. I love to get these things done. It's  acting. There's a rush. The rush of a cot will pleasure of it. is knowing that you have more power than the person you're chronic. more. that it's a cot. And let's face it. Given the choice between being the mark and being a cot man, nobody's going to choose to be the mark. But the problem is, the more confidence you have in your own cot, the more easily you become a mark yourself. Conmen get taken by other conmet all the time. It just seems to be something about the chicken. arrogance of always being on the knowing side of the cot. It makes for a rude, really good mark. Nancy Updag is from the old Houston Park program.

It's a measure of just how hungry people are to be able to community, but a full-fledged, tight-knit group of friends perform out of a publicity song. Back in 1996, New Musical caught rap, moving from small theater, New York Sea's village, to the big time, Broadway House, just a half-block from the school. The show presented a romanticized view of what it means to be young and broke, and to keep magical air of youth and poverty in the house that producers decided that every single night, and it's our two rows of the first two. The best thing. in the house for price nearly anyone can spray it to get 20 hours of pop less than the third of what it's meant to sell for the pop. Hundreds of things in the same way. So many that if you wanted to get one of the cheap seats, you went to arrive at 6 o'clock the night before, get online with a sleeping bed and stay out on. So they're feeling that's where we are supposed to sleep. We've been sleeping all over those photos are. So give us a stand and put it in the fridge. We're going to still find your real life size pictures in the past Man from the wall by the food During the show we had to say out there because that's the marquee area clear So as soon as the show was over and they close the doors all run over and we all  flame our spot because we don't want to see Wonder if they ever cast members And so which one was yours? , I slept under Daphne once and I think I slept under Anthony other time But Here Just leaving all the caveman, while people walk by and ignore you and you're , yeah, I'm just  those people who are , , really think that's what a small part of you. That's all part of you thinks that. And , well, I identify more with the play,  the more you can be  it. When they were online, everybody would hang out all day, grab some food in the tunnel to have a diner or a cross-stream. And the fancy didn't shop with theater and anything. It communicates with an e. know this, the pointy to rent her to me. Plus, the number of suburban pizza and junk back on the students, just as it was closer to the rent fairs, to a France back in the first home. It was on the rent line when the first came out of the skate, on the first rent back home. A lot of people had this was the first community that went to the room. Thanks for subscribing! It's easy to see why they  the show, which unironically celebrates, but it unironically caused the Bohemian life in French. A life with poverty, love, and art. Setting is contemporary New York. Character is a homosexual, homeless people, interracial couples, drug addicts, flailing artists, and doomed HIV positive levels. The move to the show is that once a panpasticity idealistic and desperately tragic, several people can kill insects. Among the thrones of young people who were drawn to the magnetic pool of rents message that we should live each day  it's our only day on earth was young students who were cost-steffed. All of our inner fewies are served in the cops. We met about three years ago in the civil rights of student management, we belonged to the famous mailing list online and she'd go up to New York with some traditional college and they stayed in my apartment while they were  a shit show. These Katherine Skidman. The friend of Stephanie's, one of the ringladers on the new house, she was a founder of one of the big internet man with the snap show. She's young, used to run computer hack with circles, one of her tattoos and social security number in binary code. PeshawWorks were a web start-up. Stephanie was one of the many people she got to know, back during the day. I lived in a closest to the theater at anybody, and I was the only person in the line who had her own apartment, so I used to let friends stay with me when they drove up. How long did you let somebody sit? Up, on every calendar. The better we can. It was  a turn to be the hotel captain. She says Stephanie let everyone know that she had a medical condition called autonomic neuropathy. She said it was terminal. She told us to be blown along and she told us members of the castover. When she was in New York, she used to come to the stage door and ask her to give her tours backstage, dressing out for lunch. She went she would email us and said you were going to say, I'm not feeling great. , could you ask the cast to send me a car? could do, ask them to email me. I first got a letter that she kind of said the same letter to several of us in the past in New York. Anthony Wapp played the lead role in her. She was , young, aspiring actress, students who were suffering from an illness and that the show brought her great comfort. And she didn't know how long she lived and , my heart went out to learn. It's all right. All right. It's all right. just went out to her. It really did. When Stewart was another test. Whenever she came to the show, I would make sure that I spent trying to spend a little time with her. We've gone out to dinner a couple times. I'm going to sit around a talk and I called her on the phone. I gave her my home number and it was the point where I literally made a point of praying for this girl each and every night. Well, it ultimately will be where we were here. she was about to be her surgery and she was very scared about it and that she came to the York right before she was gonna have it. That was when the coins to her and I went to lunch and her. she said that she was contemplating suicide and I'm a spiritual person and I got as far as I look up all these scriptures to support life and to support hope and faith and I would give them to her and tell her the reader Bible and  and a lot of the conversations were  that and then  if it got a little too have a, , we're swinging around to rank. And at that lunch, she brought out some medical paraphernal,  a syringe and  a,  an IV, to the thing she went after the bathroom to supposedly administer the self-suffin medication. After her lunch with the stars in the north, Stephanie could back to the city with she was far. She got in her touring cup of the event. and they held up  she was getting to know Dan and the friend of them telling the story and they held a prayer circle for her and nice and forth and supposed to certain. You mean just backstage and she was backstage and they held it, she was there with Cass and there's... Perhaps you've already figured out where all this is going, in the end Stephanie did not turn her from all those moments and ever would have known. Which map will that restore? his half-part she was able to push the law and how compulsively she did, almost  it was out of her control to stop herself. And she got sicker, the friends in New York started to get emails and someone named Monica who claimed to be a friend of Stephens. It was Monica who wrote, Stephens made a speech. Monica claimed the accounts of Stephens' condition, and urged them to organize get well-crubeds and calls from the past. Katherine later collected all of Monica's Stephanie's emails between NASA and Dr. She called the log conceptual. her roommate, Jen Eldridge, Lawson Metz Stephanie and her classmate. It's a good or a close friend. Captain Stitter Computer, she's called. Oh yeah, oh, where's my favorite card room? Yeah, my favorite email is good. I don't even have a card room, it's not a good card room. Well, the suicide was good too. There's coma and suicide. Do you do? It's hard to go for suicide. Here we go. This is an email from Monica on Friday, November 7, 1997, at 9 p.m. where she says she sent this. It's directly to me. I'm at Stephanie's. I just followed the EMTs out to the ambulance. Stephanie tried to end it all tonight. I found a syringe and an MP container of morphine. She didn't know that I was coming to check on her. Love, love, love, love. They say she'll be okay and I caught her just in time. She really went all out and I don't know how much of this to plan or how much. And keep in mind, this is a weekend. She knew that all of her friends were converging in New York. I kept it as a apartment. we were all going to be there together when this email came out. And I think we were all in different levels of transit. We're going to be in different levels of transit. you got this email and started, , just be very upset. I was trying to get contact and everybody's in cars and I was trying to get there. And then what happened? Once we were on new... That's... We tried to call the hospitals and we tried to call 911 to see if they had a record of it. , all 10 in. Oh, you tried to call an hospital and you couldn't find it. And I couldn't find it. We couldn't find it. We couldn't... No hospitals in her area had records of her being checked in. So we just said, oh my god, she's somewhere. We can't get to our meal and what to do. and nobody knew what to do. It's missing the unthought out. It is. What did she think we're gonna do once you got that thing? No. I don't know. And so you're evening together, you're , we're all of you. We're gonna be together hanging out and just being completely- Yeah, it was really miserable. We were , we were , I guess we saw the show and everybody balled their way through it and cried their way through it and went and told the cast members, of course, because that's what we thought she'd want us to do. Who was one person? What was dad and mom and his story? Just that. So at the time his boyfriend started laughing. Fashioned it only doubted the step he was set. He thought it probably killed him. This was his problem, and that show was set. Anthony was all about trust and love. He was all about synthesis and this process. Fortunately for him, his friend Sean and Michelle cost me. So we were suspicious we were talking more about it for a few days, but then she goes to the hospital and she goes to the coma. That is. know, America. Sit, step moves in the home. When this happened, Katherine, who wasn't doubting off, made a decision. I talked to Katherine, Katherine was , even though she doesn't want us to go to the step move, doesn't want me visitors, we're going to go, she's in the home, we should do them. And I said, good. And I said, tell mom, as soon as they told mom, step move. The suit is that happened, Sean and Michelle and I were pausing. So we'd , what did that mean to you? They'd  that, they said, welcome. You woke up, see? and have to come. He's the monics away. She brings me, , oh, she's better. You don't have to come. She'd  to see you the few days. , it was , so obviously she was pushing off. So we wanted to be able to find a way to make, , sure. How to make sure. But it turns out that we live in a country where there's an emergency requiring a Palmer, nutrition, panic, people turn to professionals. When it comes to detective work, deep down, the album. It really became, . A crusade that became, I mean, there was three days where none of us slept. We only worked on this and that was... ...this... ...to Derris... They called dozens of hospitals in the city with Stephanie Webb. Asking if she was a patient. They researched the disease she's supposed to have. They could have her old emails so she could conclude this. Finally, they decided to call the elusive Monica, known in every spell from two. It turned out that there wasn't a fact of Yomaka. And when the school was stepping, and after some speedwork. They found her real last name, called the information, and there's that. She existed, she was there, you're being , this was when, you said, the moment of crisis that we were running around the apartment, freaking out, thinking to be our terrible people, because we called this number, and this girl is, and yes, step by step, she's much better, and we were terrible, Senator people, it was everything that is long, and we were all looking at us, and how can we ever think this happens by some time on it, how can we start first? So, all the number and moniker ends. And I was so nervous. I remember using my IG, the kitchen, you think, sort of plastic character top. And I was so nervous that I was shaking. I was not able to fall over and go to sleep. I heard about you because I was loud noise. I was , I said, have you seen or have step in? Did you see how step in? Did you see how step in? said she's doing better. So I said, okay, thank you. And I hung up with her because I didn't want I couldn't deal with him. But immediately, Michelle Sarmara, she's doing better. She really is, she really is sick. So we thought, wait a minute, maybe not. So they were , I have to call back. I'm not going to call back. We just found out we're horrible people. She really is, oh, blah, blah. So they were , she didn't sound concerned. She didn't sound worried. Call back. So we waited for him. So I called back and I was , hi, I'm sorry. Monica and Josh. She didn't look, was was okay. I stepped in, which was on the soft path this morning. And that was it. The contact is stepping. We know that they had talked to the real mom. They knew there was no calm. After some hedging, stepping back. And then she went back. The next week, Catherine used to play in the department. And we had to talk to the staff. No, I had a list compiled of questions from our friends on why she did this. How sick was she? And she had basically admitted that she did this as a private attention. And so I took it. and when overboard , that once she started telling us all of these lies about what was going on, she didn't have anything back out of it. Then she kept going and she didn't feel  she could stop in any moments. Stephanie declined to request the interview from the radio stream. Chen remembers that before everybody knew truth about stuff. Was a regular thing, a panicky costume to midnight to air. She would call me crying when over the night, but she just, ready to kill herself, deal with the... I honestly think that when she called me and said these things that it was done, it was just sort of something that went along with it and we were talking about it when she needed to. And we needed to be upset and cry and there were many conversations. She didn't know how to do it anymore. And as I looked back on and I wonder if some of those, I don't know how to deal with it. It's really about she didn't know how to tell me. She does. I think there was a point for her when she was at this was going to call up in the face. We're that we lose my day and we're getting to you. You're someone care Will I wait to love or from you? There is night man You  this life? I worry about the pot of this program It is of course about terminal illness One pair of two dies Another new we dies And... It's very much about what people do in the basement. And in the case of the show, the group of friends were bands together. And so, I don't know, I guess, I read some of all Stephanie thought we would appreciate the pride of some of the who's young, based on some title of that. And then everybody would band around. In a way, it's  a cheese cafe. asking ourselves in the show. Yeah, sure. See, in a way, it's , , what does a fan want from the show, especially the company comes back and again, it's , how they want to get closer to you. They want to get inside. They want to be in it. I know what I see a show that I love. I want to be in it. I'm not seriously. I'm proud of the best team. In fact, the script of the show provided a model for everyone had access to them. But through the fans who saw the show, let's go. past, so I got the hearts every night, about the importance of sticking by your friends in the dark. Stephanie got a bookish. I don't know if she gets sympathy and attention. She got it from the very people who she watched on-state, and ran. Time and again. We're Katherine went back to the world and knows. She noticed how often Stephanie is asked to the liberal message to me. We're asking her. Afterward, it was just pretty sick to read back and see it that she really didn't care about her. She let's all. We thought we were friends, carried more about the cast and our reaction. , the printing the show were angel dies and all the other characters come forward and give what it's of it. , give what the viewer, which is. Do you think that Stephanie panistize about all of you did? Absolutely. She emailed us and said, , when I go and when they put me in the ground, I want, , I want so and so to sing the breeze of all cover you from the show at my grave. It was great. When I first realized that it was all alive, very angry. Again, cast member Gwen Scoot. Very angry, and that's why I didn't speak to any of them, because I had allowed a bunch of strangers to come into my life and to an outcome. hard to get. After this did you change your attitude towards transition? Yeah, I'm adding a girl out my number anymore, but I still sign about it grass. I still took the time to talk to people and now to pictures my other stuff. I didn't, I didn't open myself up. Well, or it's dropping trade , and I had to make sure it wasn't allowed anybody else to do that. Have you ever thought of this happen? Did you want to pray for her? Still. Oh, I did. I did, because I realized that sickness and death were the least of her problems. Back on putty first street, back in jail. Do  what step? No, well, since. That's what he was just doing. More extreme for him. What a lot of people do. It's kind of not surprising to find out that something you think about someone in the line is a lie. Or just  a little off. Sasha, please don't give me a start. But , for example, this is  a friend's show. But that is not his name. And how long did I know you before I knew that that was not your name? What did you do here if I was not my name? What is your name? My name? Joe Howduty. I'm a high-end of this bridge whose bill name was Lara. I've 15 year-off to everybody top 22 and many 18 years. Throughout, only on the neutral graph, for the first time. I mean, I actively knew it was not real life. , , and I actually would say my rent rent and my real rent is, , but it's  really weird how  something that was so not real, , affected real life so much. Not when we had criticized. that's what theater wants to do is they want you to, , become emotionally involved and care about something and then leave it and go back to your real life. Which is what Stephanie did on the ramp on. She got everyone emotionally involved. It didn't care about me. And then, she went back.
