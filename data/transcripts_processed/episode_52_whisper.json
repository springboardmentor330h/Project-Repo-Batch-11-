So, who will pick that word? Although there were plenty of people who severe and debilitated mental illness, just as often, the line between crazy and not crazy is boring, so many different kinds of people to follow in both categories. But I think we captured our attention and our hearts, and we talked with some people that we know. It's not how they're different from us, but how they're the same. But the B is the ancient cog of the Public Radio International. This is American Life, America Glass. Today on our program we can use stories of insanity that is part of mental illness. People who stand on the borderline can be sanity in cities. Hac won, girl interrupted. A movie has been made out of Susanna Cason's memoir girl interrupted that mental hospital. If you've never read the book, it is one of the most remarkable pieces of nonfiction writing in the last few years. We have an excerpt. Hac too, guided by voices. We also have this. Tate, made by people who actually hear voices in their heads, and the tape is designed to simulate what it is that they hear. Act 3, play the text, David Sedaris, explains the voices that he hears in his head. Act 4, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps. What it's  if you hold the keys to the asylum, but your treatment is not too steady. Act 4, you don't have to be crazy. At one, at the age of 18, after a brief appointment with the psychiatrist who she had never met before, she's in a case and entered the plane psychiatric hospital. Her book girl interrupted the desk and she was in the ward for two-nage girls, which she spent most of two years. It's probably an account of what it's  to have certain echelapses. I probably encounter every day life on the ward. The nurses, the girls , can identify doctors and the way the young women on the ward interacted with a child in deep cases. One day a second Lisa and Rath, called her a viral full name, Lisa Cody, to distinguish her from the real Lisa, who remains simply, Lisa,  a queen. The Lisa's became friends. One of their favorite activities is having phone conversations. The three phone booths near the double lock double doors were our own privacy. We could go in one and shop and go on. Even the craziest person that sits in a phone booth in a private conversation. Though only with itself. The nurse is happy. was permitted numbers to reach them. When we picked up the phone, a nurse would answer, hello, we'd say this is Georgina or Cynthia or Pauli, I want to call 555-4-270. That's on your list in your sister, then the line would come in. But there was still the quiet dusty phone booth and the old fashioned black and silver with sharp doorstep width. The leases had phone conversations. Each one got in a booth, Pauli's door shut and yelled into her business. When the nurse answered me to yelled, off the line, then the Lisa's got on with her conversation. Sometimes they yelled insults, sometimes they yelled about their plans to be there. Wanna go over to the cafeteria for dinner with the Cody with yelled, but Lisa was restricted to the ward, but she had to yell back something , why do you want to eat that slot with all those psychotics? In which Liz the Cody with yelled, what do you think you are? Susie a pet, Lisa would yell, how? Lisa Cody didn't have- I have a diagnosis here. Cindy was depressed. Paulians or Dean of the Skips Friends. I had a character disorder. Sometimes they call it personality disorder. When I got my diagnosis, it didn't sound serious. But after a while, it sounded  a bomb. It's the mother's weakness. I imagine my character and plate were shirt. I have a man's factory in front. And she'd been with us a lot more so Lisa Cody got a diagnosis. She was a sister of Pap 2. She was happy because she wanted to be  Lisa in all of the Lisa was not so happy because she had been the only sister of Pap 1. We are very rare she told me once. We are mostly women. After Lisa Cody got a diagnosis, Lisa started making more trouble. After now, the nurses are... We... what it was, the real Lisa was probably not really supporting the service. Lisa Tongk are sleeping meds for a week, took a walk once and stayed zong for a day and night. Lisa Cody managed to save only four of hers and when she took them to shoot the Lisa put a cigarette out on her arm, six thirty in the morning while the nurses were changing ships. That afternoon Lisa Cody burned a tiny well on her wrist and spent the next twenty minutes running cold water on. Then they had a light history down. Lisa warmed out of Lisa's potty that she'd grown up in Greenwich, Connecticut. Greenwich, Connecticut. She sneered. No Sophie passed the murder from there. Were you a Debbie Tante, too? Speed by Judy's co-parone. Lisa had done it all. Lisa, Cody said she'd been a junkie, too. She rolled her sleeve back to show her track. Thanks scratches along the veins, at once. Here's her form. She'd tangled with a rope. That suburban junkie, said Lisa. you were playing that's one. Hey man, Junks Junks, please a quote of the test. Lisa pushed her sleeve up to her elbow and shoved her arm and Lisa pulled his nose. Her arm was studded with tail-brown lumps, and aromotten. These, so Lisa, are tracksman, later we work next. A little bit down a little more. iances Back Lisa. The Cody was beaten but she didn't have the sense to give up. She still sat beside me's contract with the hall meeting. She still waited in the hall booth for the call didn't come. I got to get rid of her. You're a mean policy. I'm scared to see me. Who as a piece of politics he can't do. But Lisa didn't bother the crowd-bombs. One evening when the nurses walk the halls of just the town the lights lay out on the ward is bright and darned. We are safe. We found every light bulb gone. Not broken, then. We knew who's done. The question was, where'd she put? It was hard to search in the darkened. Even the light bulbs in our rooms were gone. Lisa had the two artistic tapers in her team. Just honest, you're nervous, everybody caught. Lisa sat out upon me to do me. It was Lisa's podium found her in the shoe of merch. She was probably planning to sit out upon as well in the place where health memories are better. She must have felt some resistance which she tried to hold door back. There were dozens of white bones inside, but she persevered, just as she persevered with me. The crunch and clutter brought us all spain-free down the phone booth. Broken, so at least pony. Everyone asked me to hash it down it, but also what I'd say was, I've got a long, skinny arm. This pony disappeared two days later. Somewhere between our ward and the cafeteria, she slipped. where nobody ever found her over a search went on for more than the loop. She couldn't take this point to the reason. And though we listened for a trace of jealousy who were going to speak at the hour. Some months later, Lisa ran off and aweshing with the taking people of gynecology console for the master. Two days she managed this time. Ruchi got back, she looked especially pleased with the sound. I saw his apologies. said that he was probably shook her head. She's a real junkie now. Said Lisa, smile. One girl among us had set herself on fire. she used gasoline. She was too young to drive for time. I wondered how she got in home. As she walked in her neighbor on the garage and told them her father's car had run out of gas, I couldn't look at her without thinking about it. I think the gasoline had settled in her collarbones, forming pools there beside her shoulders because of her neck and cheeks, her scarred the mom. The scarred were thickened, alternating bright and white, inscribed of something. They're so tough and wide that she couldn't turn her head. It had to swivel her entire upper torso, she walked her to see her person staying next to him. Scar tissue has no power. It's not white skin. It doesn't show age or illness or power or demand. It has no pores, no hair, no wrinkles. It's  a sock cover. It shields and disguises in what's new. It's  a sock cover. It shields and disguises in what's new. That's why we grow it. We have something to buy. Her name was Pauline. This name must have seen ridiculous to her in the days on Monts from Chief Planning to set herself on fire. But it suited her well on her slip-covered survivor one. She was never unhappy. She was kind and confident to those who were unhappy. She never complained. She always had time to listen to other pieces from pieces. She was bought and earned her man off tight and white. What ever had driven her, whispered dog, and her once perked, now scarred here, she had been old. Why did she do it? Nobody knew nobody dared to ask, because what courage? Who had the courage to burn himself? Twenty aspirants, a little slit alongside the veins of the arms, maybe even a bad half-hour standing on the roof. We've all had her, and somewhat more dangerous to you. What's in her garden? Now, if you put it there, you taste it. It's called in Greece. Your fingers on the trigger. And you find that a whole world lives between this moment and the moment you can plan it, when you're folded. That world could've gone back in the draw, so half of the time another. What was that moment  for her? The moment she lived in that. Had she already tried Bruce and guns and asked me, was it just in this? I had an inspiration once. I woke up on morning and I knew that today I had to swallow 50 masks and with my cat, my job for the day. I lined them up on my desk and took them one by one. But it's not the same for she. I could have stopped at 10 or 30 and I could have done what I did did, which was go under the stream and stream. 50 athletes, a lot of athletes going under the stream and painting the white cream gone back and forth. She left me. Where? In the garage at home, where she wouldn't set anything else on fire, out in the field, in the high school gym, in an empty swimming pool? Somebody found her, but not for a while. Who would kiss a person on that a person would not sleep? She was 18 before this thought occurred to her. She spent a year with her. Other people stormed in screen and cringey poth. She sat by people who were frightened and her presence calm me. Her smile wasn't me. It was understand. this palace she knew that. But her smile, she did. She burned all that out of me. Her smile was a little bit superior. We wouldn't have occurred to burn it out of our cell. But she understood that too. You were on this different. People just didn't think. One morning somebody was crying. But mornings were often enough. and fight about getting up on time and complaints about nightmares, probably was so quiet, so unattribable present. Yet we didn't notice she wasn't a breakfast. After breakfast we could still hear crying. Who's crying? Nobody knew. And at lunch there was still crying. It's probably cities who knew everything. Why? But even Lisa didn't know why. At dusk we're crying change to screaming. As the days have passed. The first she screamed, ah! And E! Then she started to scream words, My face, my face, my face. We can hear other voices shushing her, murmuring comfort, but she continued to scream her two words long into the night. We said, well, I've been expecting this for a while, and then I think we all realized what fools we do. He might get out sometime, but she was locked up forever in that spot. Suzan, a case that he took his card, he drove into the rupture.

That is by coincidence. had to even heard voices and she was a psychologist. When she was a girl the voices were friendly. She thought everybody was her voice. She didn't know that other people didn't. But when she turned 17 the voices changed, they became vicious, critical, unbearable. She was diagnosed as a skit's furniture. Here's later, as a psychologist herself, she thought the only way mental health workers can really understand what the patient's got to go is if they hear the voices too. So, she and some other people, the voices got together. They talked about the kinds of things the buses normally say to them, put together a script, and had it recorded. And then they set up these training sessions. We're mental health workers in the district. And we're walking. And while they are listening to the voices, we also have them go through a mock-to-cyciatric emergency services, situation where they receive a mental status exam. They go to a psychological testing center where they do a reading comprehension test. They go to a mock-to-treatment. program where they do some cognitive puzzles and we also send them out into the community to have some kind of interaction, get four quarters for a dollar for instance, but they have to have some kind of social exchange with the public while experiencing these voices. And the actual voices that we're hearing on the tape are these people who actually experience voices or they act as they are. These aren't actors, no. All of us were voice-ears. And are people simply reciting the voices that they themselves hear in their heads sometimes. Now interestingly, we decided as a group that wants some voice here as much to dangerous the thing to do. People can actually internally get into enormous conflict and go into enormous crisis by revealing the content of what it is their voices are saying. Voices very frequently don't want to be broadcast all over the places. So we had to take great care around that as voice here as ourselves. And so for example, they're there. He just says, you disgust me. That isn't his own. That isn't what he himself hears. That's what somebody else might hear. That's right. That's right. Look at them. Their eyes are filled with disgust. No one's going to stop the music. Stop it now. Stop. Stop. Stop. I see. I see. I see. Or do. I see. They know how. the way people actually experience this is that their several voices at once. Again, it's enormous individual variation with this, but it's not at all unusual for people to have more than one voice and to have more than one voice. activated or talking at the same time. Or the voice is generally negative at the same rate of hearing. That seems to be a characteristic of people who are showing up for help with the voice hearing experience is that there aren't a predominance of helpful or good voices of the common. Still, flying the specialty of garbage. I said, you gotta play this game. Voted. Little dirt, smirk, laugh in her, you're not funny, you're pathetic. Hmm, this is a big thing, this is big, this is great! No, I think that Pony will have you as you, that's right. It's interesting because over the last few days, as you can see, that is... and it's made in the future. But I've tried to be aware of whether whether in some low level way, I hear voices in my head. And I feel  I hear songs run through my head a lot more than I hear actual voices. And I was wondering if you do what voice here is experienced is being just on a continuum for my deputy experience as , every day, right? I think that the idea of a continuum is a nice one, but I... I'm afraid in this way it's, I don't think it's accurate to talk about voice hearings being a continuum. The new big, big difference between hearing the song and your head and having experience of hearing distress in voices is that first of all in the true sense of hearing you don't hear it in the way that you hear my voice right now. The voice hearing is the experience is first and foremost in most primal. Todd Wood? You absolutely hear it. Hey, no matter what you mean, hey, hey, yeah, if you were not here, you're nothing. what to see.  it. Flowdown. Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, getting hot, slow down, getting hot, and getting hot, slow down. Hide away, hide away. what? You can't hide. You can't hide. They know when you are in a quiet, , matter what you do. They know. , I know. , they all know. Ah! Stop. You put together a, what, what, I'm only gonna tell you, that there's a conflict that purping the places, self-up strategies for people, fear voices that are just passing. Right. Right. Right. and some simple things that they can do. And one of them that you suggest is one of them is using earplugs. You say, something can look down that putting an earplugs in here. You're great in your juice or eliminate distress and voice. Yes, this is interesting finding. And inherently, what they've found is that putting the wax in both ears does not work. You have to try to try on an error, work with it right here, then you left. for some people, for instance, putting it in the right ear, leaving it there for 15 minutes, will interrupt the voices and in some cases, make them go away. For other people, you leave it in the right ear for 15 minutes and it's only when you take the plug out that the voice is interrupted and or stop. Do you have any thoughts about why it might work? No, I really don't. This is just as simple as well, it just changed the situation and just didn't change. Again, this is a physical. I think frankly, after my studies and also through a lot of personal trial and error and learning experiences myself that there really is enormous truth that anything that promotes a sense of personal efficacy and power. That seems to be the key that these voices which present themselves as the all-knowing, all-powerful. We know everything we see everything you do and on and on. on to find that I can interrupt that powerful force really creates a space for me to have some power. And of course this flies in the face of what much of modern psychiatry is saying that people who are experiencing major mental illness are having broken brains and can't possibly take a stand towards what's ailing them except to take medications. I feel we're doing enormous to service in me. states in particular by saying that medications are the only answer. Have you talked about your own experiences? I don't want to include anything that's private and done to the level. No, I do talk about it in some general, yes. In your own experience at New Successory, made voices go away. Please leave it a comment. I live with distressing voices on almost a daily basis. 24 hours a day, but usually in the course of the day, my voices do come. So for instance, just before coming into this recording studio, I was sitting out in a waiting area in the B.R. offices, and there's a lot of what I would call white noise out there. White noise coming from a fan and an ventilation system in the room. And for me, that was very prominent. And for me and many other voice-hairs, a white noise situation is a... set up for the emergence of distressing voices. So as that began to happen, I could say to myself, okay, it's going to be all right. I know I've got 10 minutes before the interview starts. And I pulled out a near plug and I put it in my left ear, which is the ear that works for me. And I reassured myself that once I got out of the white noise situation that I would be doing better. How do you conceive of the voices that you hear? Do you conceive of them as being separate? yourself or do you perceive them as being a part of yourself that you can recognize? I think that for me it's a goal to eventually be able to say these voices are a part of me and that's actually one of the self-help coping strategies that I do use sometimes. So for instance if I have a particularly derogatory awful voice that I might say as a coping strategy today. I am feeling  I am no good. Today I am feeling  I'm a worthless person. These are my thoughts, these are my feelings. Is that because when the voice is saying that literally you are not having the feeling I want to be in dad today? That's right. Wow. Dr. Patricia Digan, for organization the National and Carmen Center, can be reached out. That's $900 to you. That's one. than the word power, and the number two, and the letter U. Music I'm coming up David Cideris Rocks. But not the usual moment say that. And other stories, in a minute, the public video international when I put them in the This is American Life, my request. Each week on our program of course we choose theme and variety of writers that make you produce a few performers to do stories on that theme. Today's program on the edge of mental health. Stories of people who stand right at the border of sanity and sickness. We've arrived at the 3 of our program, CLEGED OF TIX. Well, regular listeners to our show are familiar, very familiar, stunningly familiar. But David Sedaris, in the pasties, come on to the show to tell stories about getting the drama bug in high school, of his sister and mother deciding that they're gonna solve crimes, of his first attempt to himself at visiting a nudist colony. Today's story begins in grade school. With the teacher asked if she might visit with my mother, I touched my nose eight times to the surface of my nose. I take that as a yes, she asked. According to her calculations, I left my chair 28 times that day. You're up and down  a flea. I turn my back for two minutes and there you are with your tonne pressed against that light switch. Maybe they do that where you come from, but here at my classroom we don't leave our seed and lick things whenever we please. That is Miss Chestnut's light switch and she likes to keep it dry. Would you  to? You can't just make a video about your house and put my town on your light switches. Well, would you? I tried to picture her in action, but my shoe was calling. Take me off, digress her. Tap my heel against your forehead three times. Do it now. Quick. No one will notice. Well, Miss Chestnut raised her paint penciled eyebrows. I'm asking you a question. Would you or would you not want me looking? the lights which is in your house. I slipped off my shoe, pretending to examine imprint on heel. You're going to hit yourself on the head without shoe, aren't you? It wasn't hitting it was tapping, but still, how would she know me that I was about to do? Heel marks all over your forehead, he said, answering my silent question. It was a short distance from the school rented house. No more than six. 137 steps, and on a good day I could make the trip in an hour, pausing every few feet the Tom-A-Mail box, so touch whichever single leaf or a blade of grass in that in my pension. If I were to lose count of my steps, I'd have to return to the school in the again again. I might touch the telephone pole at step 314, and then 15 paces later, worry that I hadn't touched it in exacting the right spot. It needed to be touched again. This was a lot. and complicated process at the manned and impressive attention to detail. By past that mailbox in my brain that never had one month, I might be sitting at the dinner table, daring myself not to think about it, and the thought would revisit my mind, don't think about it, but it was already too late, and I knew that exactly what I had to do. If excuse myself to go to the bathroom, I'd walk out the front door and return to that mailbox, not just touching the jabbing, but actually pounding on the thing. because I thought I hated so much. What I really hated of course was my mind. It must have been an off switch, but I was gambling  you find it. I didn't remember things being this way back more. Our family had been transferred from any cotton in York to Raleigh, North Carolina. That was a word used by the people at IDIM, transferring. New home waslands��어. but in pill it was finished, we were confined to a rental property built for example of presentation rooms. The building sat in a treeless, bald and dark. It's white columns promising the majesty of the interior. The front door opened down to a dark, narrow hallway, lined with bedrooms, not much larger than the mattresses which furnished them. Once home I would touch the front door seven times in the cellbone. I tasked made much more difficult if there was anyone to the door. I tried to nod my sister Lisa would say, that's what the rest of us do when it seems to work for us. Inside the house it was switches and door stops to be acknowledged. After kissing the fourth, eight and twelve carpeted stair, I wiped the cat hair from my lips and proceeded to the kitchen, where I was commanded to disturb the burners of the stove, pressed my nose against the refrigerator door, and arranged the percolator, poster and blender to a straight mouth. After making my rounds of the living room. It was time to kneel beside the banister and blindly jab a butter night in the direction of my preferred electrosock. They were bulbs to link, in bathroom faucets, the test, before finally I was freed into my bedroom. Where I would carefully align the objects and my dresser, lick the corn with my metal vest, and lie on my bed, rocking back and forth and taking a wet and odd woman's shoes. My third grade teacher is just not. I'm here and lick my light switches, which I'm in. to reuse the ones she had. Then she was dropped. On the afternoon at Miss Chestnut arrived for her visit, I was in my bedroom, Ross. I liked the obsessive counting and touching, rocking was not a mandatory duty, but a voluntary and highly pleasurable exercise. It was my hobby, and it was nothing else I've got to do. The point was not to lock oneself asleep. This was not a step towards some greater gong. It was the gold itself. The perpetual movement freed my mind, allowing me to mold things over and construct a lab-rantly detailed fantasies. Toss in a radio and I was content to rock until three or four o'clock in the morning, listening to the hit parade and discovering each and every song was about me. I might have to listen to with 300 times to the same song. Proceed in your related private message. I was coming to terms with the shadow of your smile, when Miss Chestnut smiled. She rang the bell and I cracked open the bedroom door, watching his my monitoring by her door. You'll have to forgive me for these boxes, my mother's flick to cigarette out the door and the littered yard. They're filled with crap, every last one of them, but God forbid we throw anything away. So we can't do that. My husband saved it all. She mopped it at forehead with a water paper towel. Anyway, to hell with it. You look  I need a drink. Scotch alright? Miss Chestnut's eyes blackened. I really shouldn't, but... Oh, why not? She followed my mother up to stairs. Just to drop with ice, no water. I tried blocking her bed, but the sound of laughter drew me to top of the door to 나오는. with from my vantage point behind an oversized wardrobe box, I watched the two really discuss my behavior. Oh, you mean that touching my mother said. She opened her mouth just slightly, running her tongue over her upper lip, and then she inched for one. Her index finger prodding the ash trays, though it were a sleeping thing she was trying to wake. I had never seen myself an action, but a sharp, stinging sense of recognition told me that my mother was in pain. impersonation. God only knows where it gets it from, my mother said. He's probably down in his room  this minute, counting as eyelashes are annoying at the poles on his dresser. One two a clock in the morning, he'll still be at it. Waddling around the house to poke the laundry hamper or press his face against a refrigerator door. The kids wound to tight, but he'll come out. So what do you say? Another Scotch-Cathorn? Now she was petal. I know this. drinks and she'd probably be joining this under summer vacation. How easy it was for adults to bond over a second round of cocktails. I returned to my bed, cranking up the radio so it was not to be disturbed by the sound of your cat. Follow me, Miss Chestnuts visit. My father returned to the dorm with the series of friends. You touch your nose to that mean. She yelled one more time and I'll guarantee you which you hadn't he said, driving home from the grocery store with a lot fall ever ejected and stayed coupons. It was virtually impossible for me to ride in the passenger seat of a car and not press my nose against the windshield. And now that the activity had been forbid, I wanted it more than anything. I tried closing my eyes, hoping that might eliminate my desire, but found myself thinking that perhaps he was the one who should. close his eyes. So what if I wanted to touch my nose to the linchie? Who was it hurting? Why was it that he could repeatedly worry his change and bite his lower lip without the threat of punishment? My mother's smoke and Miss Chestnut massaged her waist 20 30 times a day and here I couldn't press my nose against the windshield of a car. I opened my eyes to find but when he caught me moving towards my target my father slammed down the brakes. You  that? That did you? He handed me a golf towel to wipe the blood from my nose. Did you  the feel of that? was too feeble to worry about, I loved it. If mashed with the right amount of force, a blow to the nose can be positively dark kind. Touching objects satisfied a mental edge, but the task involved the great deal of movement run upstairs across the room will move a shoe. I soon found the same merges could be fulfilled within the... conpons of my own body. Punching myself in the nose was good place to start. But the practice was dropped when I began rolling my eyes deep into their sockets. An exorcise it provided quick jolt to dull and toxicity. I know exactly what you're talking about, my mother said to Mrs. Shats, my visiting fourth grade teacher. The eyes rolling every which way it's talking to a slot machine. Hopefully one day I'll pay off but until then, what is- say we have ourselves another glass of wine. I took to violently shaking my head, startled by the feel of my brain slamming against the conphying of my skull. It felt so good and took so little time, just a few quick jerks and I was satisfied for up to 45 seconds at a time. Have a seat and let me get you something cool to drink. My mother would leave my fifth, sixth grade teachers standing in the breakfast knuckle while she stepped into the kitchen to crack open the tray of ice. I'm guessing you're here about the head shaking and my right cheek out? That's my boy alright, no flies on him. This was part of my mother's act. She played the ring reader blowing the whistle and chiming the crowd into jokes and exaggerated sports. It's a stretch but I'm betting you're here about the tiny voices she said offering glass of share to my face. of the seven grade teacher. I'm thinking of either taking him to an exorcist or buying him a doll so he can bring home some money as if I'm a trailquest. It had come out of nowhere. I desperate urge to summon high pitched noises from back of my throne. These were not words, but sounds that satisfied an urge I'd never before realized. The sounds were delivered not in my voice, but in the add of a thin bull size, temperamental diva, bringing the base of my usual. I was host to these wames, but lack debility to control. When I cried out in class, the teachers returned from the blackboard with increasing new trouble of expressions. Did somebody rubbing a balloon? Who's making their noise? I'd  to think that some of my nervous habits faded. during high school, but my class pictures tell a different story. Drawing the missing eyeballs and this one might not be so bad, my mother would say. In group shots I was easily identified as the blur of background. For a time I thought that if I accompanied my habits with an outlandish wardrobe, I might be viewed as eccentric rather than just plainly tardy. I was wrong. Only confirmed idiot would wander the halls of my high school, dressed in floor length characters. And as for the countless medallions that hung around my neck, I might as well have worn a cowbell. They clang and jangled with every jerk of my head. Calling attention when without them I might have passed I noticed. My oversized glasses did nothing but provide a clear of here with my role with twitching eyes, and the chunky platform shoes left the ears were discreetly tapped my forehead. I was in this. College is the best thing that ever happened to you my father used to say and he was right. For it was there that I discovered drugs, drinking and smoking. I'm not sure of the scientific aspects, but for some reason my nervous habits faded around the same time or took up a cigarettes. Maybe it was coincident, or perhaps the text we created in the face and had to say that despite its help lists. as much more socially acceptable, crying there, and turning the masses. It's as if I'd been born to smoke, and it'll I realize that my limbs will have to serate for some alternative. Everything's fine as long as I know it was a cigarette in my new future. The people who ask me not to smoke in your cars have no idea. The first third episode of the episode is this Wednesdaycation with his test graduation in the morning, the latest TV show performance series with himza that should post millions of comments that premieres at the video. And we begun giving up The story of Max Doctor And mother Now I call her Mama to stop the baby cry. This is my parents' community I saw my ex-girls tonight Mama She was up to dancing this song She was with that checking wife Mama I told them both And their parents Do check up sickle mom You think I? I'm sad to don't you, my home. I didn't mean to break you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If you got I'm sad to don't you, my home. You better let him love you. At four, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps. When he was in his twenties, Joe Lovell had a job in an elementary hospital. You said he worked there. 9th 6 We often made fun of the night's death, said that they were as crazy as the nation. There was Joe the monosilated body-builder, and John the Patelash of the Lion, and Sean who arrived each night in ship, rock-rooted and air tiers from Zona for the insetion screen Thursday. Between midnight and 7 we'd say, it wasn't at all clear who should be carrying the keys. The suggestion of course was that during the day it was clear, and that those of us who carried the keys. The shrinks from Harvard. nurses in charge of the floor, even the lowly mental health workers  myself, for all models of sanity and the midst of so much chaos. We had keys to everything. There was a key to the front door and a key to the nurse's station. There were keys to the therapy offices and to the linen closet and to the staff bathroom across from the quiet rooms. To windowless white isolation areas to which we also had keys. And of course there was the restraint key. A thin pointed silver thing, more  a tiny pocket knife than a key. It's slipping in the pocket window, especially in the pocket room. We used to secure patients in the midst of corners of a metal bed. If a patient wanted to use the toaster we had the cane. If they wanted to use their own nail clippers, they were kept in a cabinet and we had the cane. During the day we moved through the hallway to team of custodians. Resting patients out of bed, urging them to shower and dress and brush their teeth. Return in hospital parlance to their. activities of daily living. We ushered them into large group meetings and small group meetings, meetings in which we discussed the dynamics on the hall, meetings in which we explained the effects of medication, meetings in which patients were often told news they didn't want to hear, that they would have to endure another round of electro shock therapy, that they were not well enough to attend their doctor's birthday party. That for yet another week, they would not be allowed to do almost anything unsupervised. It was a place where much more often than not. Short-term hopes were dashed. inevitably sad outcomes were commonplace, and anger over illnesses that no one knew precisely how to treat could erupt spontaneously. We were constantly gauging the mood of the hall, in the way that I imagine desperate farmers gauging the mood of the skies, and reacting accordingly. There has to be more of a staff presence on the hall someone would say, you're even there was a culpable tension on the unit, a sense of danger in the air, and that rather than spending time back in the nurse's station blowing off steam and catching up on notes, we had to make our presence known out of the floor. Occasionally, for extra money, I'd work nights. Everything about the place seemed different. It's a sentimental motion I know, but I could never play it shake the sense when driving through the front gate for a night shift, of entering a parallel universe. The place where all the days demons were later rest, where medicines worked, where minds were calm, where the Satan we tried so hard to create during the day was actually made right. I drive slowly along the winding road to our unit and look out at the moon on the snow. At the lights on here and there in red brick buildings across the hospital grounds. And I think that for all the terrors of Placinth this canot, it couldn't possibly look more well for me, less coldly clinical than it did in the middle of the night. Night of course can have this effect anywhere, exhaustion finally wins out of a struggle. But the sense of calm that settled in at the hospital always surprised me. The job at night, such as it was, you consisted mostly of just staying away. If you were the staff member on checks, you were responsible for knowing where each patient was. You sat in the foyer with a flashlight, and every 30 minutes made a tour from one in the room together. Poking your head into each darkened room and shining a quick bloom of light on patients to sleep in the vents. It was a simple remarkable thing to say, people in so much painfully. There was Barbara the Reverend's wife who previously had snuck in utility razor and cut a five inch gash into the solar report. And there was Tim the former track star who gained so much weight from taking anti-cycotic meds that he spent hours each day with his high school yearbook in his lab, open to a page that had a photo of some graceful, muscled kid who looked vaguely. There was Anne and Mike and there was Carol who sister came every Thursday afternoon. Never she visited, watch them in the oil. Carol's sister talking and Carol's starring out from 100 thick glasses, smoking cigarette after cigarette, her face, her hair, led to a smudge version of the attractive woman sitting next to her. My own brother, the person I loved most in the world, was a patient in a psych hospital in Saratogen. It seems obvious now that I couldn't quite articulate it to myself at the time, that I worked what I did not because, as I told myself, it would help me on my application school. But because it allowed me to be. be both closer to my brother, and more distance from him. To understand and some vaguely intimate way with you a suffer. And to reassure myself that I was in fact safe from his meds, that I was so saying I carry peace. Whenever I visited him I couldn't stop myself from imagining us  her on her sister, his goofest to my gallon, and the thought both comforted me filled me with you. After I checked in the last. I'd go back to the foyer and buy my time. I'd sit and drink coffee and wash the cloth, waiting for the next half hour to take by. Right, I'm a deck of cards on one of the shelves in play solitaire. For sometimes I try reading letters to my brother that I never said. Opening them with some bad joke about how at that moment both of us were in a hospital, but he was probably deep into sleep, and that was the one up scribbling nonsense. Sometimes late in the night, they could feel  I too was starting to unravel. I'd go into the nurse's station and pull a chart. to read my notes through the dashes. I'd focus on their authoritative tone. Haitian oriented a time, blaze, cell, but continues to rumenate about radio-messatives being sent for embraces. Haitian remains highly paranoid, fear of government as poison him through hospital through. At the end of most of my night shifts, my notes were all the same. Haitian slang, Haitian slang, Haitian slang. I'm the last night shift I worked. I fell asleep while I checked. The one mistake a night work was never supposed to make. I was probably out for 45 minutes, long enough, theoretically, for something terrible to happen. I woke to Carl standing in front of me in her night gown, cigarette. I need a light she said, and then she sat down next to me in the foyer and made fun of me for falling asleep. Go lie down she said. I've got everything under control here. She wasn't wearing her glasses, her hair was both bad. For disheveledness, the normal and the middle of the night. The way any of us look when shuffle and have sleep from our beds to the kitchen for that time. I'd been having a dream in which a party was going on in a hospital, but not the one where I worked. Patients were coming out of their rooms and ball gowns and tuxes, and my brother was there looking happy to handsome. Now the pleasantness of the dream was fading, and Carol must have been able to see it on my face. She asked me what was wrong, and because it was 5 a.m. And because I was exhausted and nauseous and not my appropriate daytime cell, I told her that I'd been dreaming of my brother, and that he was in a hospital soon. In the body or the head she is. The head is said. She nodded knowingly to contramendous drag on her cigarette and blow a cloud of smoke out over the two of us. He'll be alright, she said.
