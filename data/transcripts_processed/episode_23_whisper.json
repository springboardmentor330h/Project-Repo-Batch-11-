He was Sean Bear, who played fake in an Oliver. There was happy Barrao who played dark thing in the western boss and actually hugged Tiffany, who was then just a chorus member. They were in big scene and she says we buy the luncheon lamb. It was Robiness Cart, who was just a freshman when they were. Robiness Cart has been laid in Keberay and singing in the right. in when I first met her some of her and saw her in her room. I can't believe she's a freshman. And I guess she's so good. And then I had her in a few of my classes and I got to know each other. And I didn't know I wouldn't say that we're  best friends, but I know her. I had human behavior with her. And  you're in the same group or whatever. And it was , oh, she's in my group. Yeah. These days, Tiffany and I came around for a classman. It was a proper classman. in reverse high school just outside Chicago. Now they get to read roles in the school plays. And that came would never be thrown by one girl who she remembers. And wow, she was just a lead in 40 seconds straight and anything goes. Yeah, I'm really, I start talking to her too, but she was cool. And then the times that I'd need her, she was just totally gloomy off. I wasn't even important. And that just really hurt. I mean, that just really you. Not. me down, , cook park and river forest is a big school. Any reality? Most students do not get knocked down if they lead him 40 seconds straight, ice is done. Most students at the Oak Park couldn't care less. Trauma is uncool. Trauma is to be ignored. But at Oak Park, as in high schools, all across Chicago and all across are great Midwest. hundreds of miles from the sound of my voice right now. As I speak to you from Chicago, in every high school there is a small cadre of students, mirroring all the players. They can discuss it length, which show was Melty Boyle's best one. They're the ones who noticed the newspaper cutting, taped up in the nurses' office, about Robin S. Clark, who's now in college. But there's some , there's a Robin S. Clark, the new funny girl. That's , Bop, Bop, Bop, I know her. Welcome to the Ese Chicago with this American life. I'm Eric Glass, back for another week documenting everyday stories of the United States. Today's show is about the drama bug. People who get it. At one, David Sedaris tells his mom that he wants to be an actor. At two, he's a month or herhurtles for a real high school play. such Pago at three dying for Shakespeare. Stay with us. At one. David Cideras is the author of Barrow fever and of many plays, including most recently one woman's shoe from New York City. His plays get critical at claim in the New York Times and elsewhere. He's a morning edition commentator and it was this story of this, he's about to read for us. He's a story about getting the drama about. It gave us the idea to do an entire program on the junk boat. We're going to divide up the story in two parts. Here's the first. The man was sent to our school in order to inspire us. Personally speaking, I thought he did an excellent job. After introducing himself and he relaxed in casual manner, he started towards the back of the room. Only to be stopped, made way by what we came to know as the invisible wall. That transparent barrier realized only by minds, drug addicts. in certain varieties of rapid cycling psychotics. I sat in the floor, because he rited himself and began investigating the imaginary wall with his open palms, running his hands over the hard smooth surface and hopes of finding a way out. Moments later, who is tugging in an invisible room, then struggling in the face of a violent and past of wind. you're living in a small town when you can reach the night grade without ever madness in your mind. As far as I was concerned, this... man was a pro, the genius, pioneer in the field of entertainment. And here he was, a rawly North Carolina. It was a riot, the way he imitated the teacher, turning down the corners of his mouth, and rifleing through his imaginary purse and search of common aspirin, was this guy funny or white? I went home in Demi's grip. being visible wall for my infant brother, who pounded at the very real wall beside his bed, shrieking and wailing disgust. When my mother asked what I'd done to provoke him, I threw up my hands and mock innocence before lowering them to retrieve the imaginary baby which lay fussing my feet. I padded the back of my little ghost in order to induce gas, and was investigating its soil diaper when I noticed my mother's face assumed an expression she reserved for unspeakable war. I had seen this look only twice before. Once when she was caught in the path of a charging rabbit game, and once again when I told her I wanted a peach-colored velvety blazing of matching slacks. I don't know who put you up to me, she's neck, but I'll kill you myself before I watch you grow up to your client. You want a diaper or baby? Make it. yourself useful and wipe up the genuine article. She handed me my brother before turning to move the room. Because I respected her opinion I did as I was told, ending my career in mind, the whimper, rather than the silent bang I'd hoped. The visiting actor returned to the classroom a few months later, removing his top coat to reveal a black body stock in one of the party colours necklace. The result of a recent automobile accident. The Saphter news task was to introduce us to the works of William Shakespeare. And once again, I was completely captivated by his charm and skill. When the words became confusing, you needed only pay attention to the actless face and hands to know that this particular character was not just angry, and vengeful. I loved the undercurrent of hostility that lay beneath the surface of this deceptively beautiful language. pain that people no longer spoke this way, and I undertook a campaign to reintroduce Elizabeth and English to the citizens of Rome. For chance, Félodie, thou dost think me unduly, vexed that the sorrowful state of line-quarters. I said to my mother, as I ran back in while with a living room carpet she was inherently too lazy to bother with. These foul specks, the evidence of life itself, have solid not only thy and jagged tempered mat, but also thy and character. B. The mad woman, we were at a crime to neglect dying dwellings you, my feeble spirit at mistress, would hang from the tallest venerable tree in penance for your shameful ways. Be there not, linings to both laundry and iron free of turbulence, see ye not a porcelain plates and huddy mugs where ye to be washed clean of evidence, get thee to thy work damn the belady and quickly, before the products of thy very loins raise their collected fists in a spirit born of rage and ye The indignation, forcefully coaxing the last breath from the foul chamber of thy name and uprights. Go now, waste, and get to it.\" This time, my mother, a high school to our pal, was caught off guard. Members of her immediate family had done time in some serious mental institutions, and something suggested I might be next. I could tell by the state of my room that she spent the next day searching my dress if it drops. The clothes I took pride in neatly folding were cramped tight into the drawers with no regard for collar or cataclyte. I smelled the evidence of cigarettes and noticed the coffee rings left on my desk. I loved my mother dearly but messed with mind-roars and we have just made it done self in Italy. Time of feathers to the shaft of my ballpoint pen I grilled her a letter. The thing that she searched for so desperately, reside is not in mind well ordered. chambers, but in a questionable content of the iron-owned character. I slipped the note into a purse, folded twice and sealed with wax from the candles I now used to light my mouth. I took the brooding, refusing to light up until I received the copy of Shakespeare's collected place. Reading them now, just didn't provide the kick I'd hoped for. I found it more enjoyable to simply carry the box from room to room, occasionally spinning for fun words. might toss into my ever-fragrant hot catula. The dinner hour became either unbearable or expooshy, depending on the menu. Me thinks kinds are most gentle lady, fellow siblings all. The disbarnyard thou be most tasty and succulent having simmered in its own sweet juices, for such a time is it might take the sun to pass, rosy and full-fingered, across the plumb-colored sky for the course of a dry light hour. Disquist yet true. see this plump bird, satisfied in the company of such finally roasted neighbors. Hear me out, congratulations, and heed my words, for me thinks it adventurous and fancival too, to saddle mine fork with both foul and carried at the exact same time. The twin juices blending together in a delicate harmony which got control in life in the town in a spirit of unbridled marimant . What's a yee, fine father, sisters and infant brother too, that we raise our flag and tie and sell it. The vibration of this hearty feast, prepared lovingly and with tender grace by this beautiful woman we have the good fortune to address as our wife, wench or mother. My enthusiasm knew no limits, and as a result it quickly reached the point where my mother made a perfect turn to Lady Lord Mary Bell. me to wait in the car while she stepped into the van for the grocery store. I was at the birthday office, placing a box upon the practice of dentistry, when the visiting actor returned to our classroom. You missed it. My friend, Loa said, the man was so indescribably powerful that I was practising the car. That's how brilliant he was. I can't describe any better. She placed her chin in her hand and stared out the window, parked her. There's absolutely nothing left for me to say about it, nothing. I could try to explain his realness, but you'd never be able to understand it. Lois and I had been friends for six months when our relationship suddenly took on a competitive edge. I'd never cared who made better grades or had the most spending money. The each had our strengths, the important thing was to honor one another who the thing made it best. Lois complained better than I respected her. Her grow task and... excessive self-confidence allowed her to marching to school wearing a rest-colored app for a week , and I stood behind her 100%. She had more records than I did, because she was a year older. She also knew how to drive a car and did so as if she were rushing to a fire. Finally thought, good for her. I was genuinely happy for Lois and told she questioned my ability to understand of his acting act. I was the one who identified his brilliance in the first place, me, not her. Sure she'd been there beside being the classroom, but she didn't even realize that was an invisible wall until I told her. When he'd come in with his Shakespeare, she'd been just  the rest of that laughing, it is neck brace and rolling her eyes at the tangent, re-insized long thing as tights. Now she was telling me that I couldn't understand him. Me, thank, not. Honestly, woman, I said to my mother on her way to the dry canoe to think that this low lying worm might speak to me. greatness is a what were at thing invisible to mine eyes is more than I can bear. Her words goth strike mine heart with a force of a punishing blow, leaving me both stunned and highly that too. Here we go, why shall I buy my time, why and with fun, striking back at the very hour she doff least expected. Such enough front shall not go unchallenged of that she may rest to search at the mother. My vengeance will hold the sweet taste of the lightest bearing. and I shall save her at slump and with gust. You'll get over it, my mother said, give it a few weeks in the whole thing, we'll blow over her. I'm gonna be a little bit more old than you. I'm gonna be a little bit more old than you. I'm gonna be a little bit more old than you. I'm gonna be a little bit more old than you. This would become our answer to everything. She'd done some asking around and concluded that I've been bitten by what her sister called the drama. My mother was convinced this was just a phase  all the others, a few weeks of preencing and I dropped show business just  I had to guitar in my private deactivations. I hated having my life's ambition reduced the level of the common cold. This was an odd but a full-redged virus. It might lay low for a year or two, but this little germ would never go away. It had nothing to do with talent. Rejection wouldn't eat in it and no amount of success could ever satisfy. The drama bug strikes hardest with Jews, homosexuals, and plump wind and who wear their hair in bangs. These are people who, for one reason or another, desperately require the tension. I would later learn that it's a bad idea to gather more than two of these people and enclosed area for any amount of time . Stage is not an actual place, but rather a state of mind who laid it to ones wear about during the time you're not asleep. But it's defined that anyone passing along enough feeling. We were a string of light bulbs left burning 24 hours a day and as a result our exhausted public soon stopped wandering around the bus was about. Rush, ah, your Shakespeare, started quoting him now, Rush, ah, your Shakespeare, and You will know Just to claim what you lines from a fella And we'll think you're a hell of a fella If you're blind, we'll respond with you, but her Tell her what Tony told me, he had a pattern She fights when her clothes you are mustin' me What her calls much ado about Nose and Rush Up your Shakespeare and we'll all look happy David, it's a very story of getting the drama bubble continue. Later on, after another story documenting everyday life in these United States, this recording, by the way, is Sibu Shepherd, 1974, and that one caught Sibu Desert, the Cold disorder. But imagine the merchant of Venice When her sweet pound of flesh you wouldn't manage If she says she won't buy it or tie it May her tie it what more as you  it A fear Shakespeare and will all Yeah, yeah, fine. Act 2, Lost Youngers. There are only 13 rehearsals left, but the young partner requires high school production and meal assignments quite lost youngers and still, he could not know the lines. Maybe he's a fake two mama, but at least he's lucky enough to want to help me. Yeah, we're alive, but that's all we are. Aaron and Rose is lucky one, small. Don't say that to me, by the god. to play grandma at Tiffany Moore uses this metal pain during her hersels and it's become the salt purpose prop which she uses for expressing her moves waving it around in the air pointing it at people at this point she slams it against the ground the assistant director the stage manager and the director is for some sitting the audience for scripts in here and feed longs not the her own no don't say that please god don't say that to me mama no don't say that to me I don't say that to you, but I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to hurt you. Yes you do. You're my. Actually, this is not a bad shit. The actors are mastering their accents, blocking basic characters throughout down. Tiffany's on stage, the part of a part of a birth of the world, grows, veterans of seven other high school plays. Part of our plays, Bella, a slightly retarded 35-year-old woman. Part is one of the strongest performers in this cast. She's very, , soulful. But she's also Mr. Simon's biggest worry. When he critiques the actors at the end of each rehearsal, he must tell the other actors to watch their accents or try some little moment a little differently. But at rehearsal after rehearsal, he has the same criticism for Lara. Her characters are still not there. It's still not there. You're too smart. She's becoming more up. I try to think about it. It's easier when I say it. It's  that. Right exactly. That's sort of reprited. But then when it's so  I'm not crying, that's it's so hard. I don't really know how to work in stupidity. Yeah. Play it more childlike all the way through, Mr. Simon tells us, and those moments will come. So your first line for instance, Jay, it's me and Bella, can I come in? Yes, we can talk about it. It's about how it's done. What is that? Comtale, come on, let me sing. Thank you. Bye, guys. Me in. There it goes. School is officially closed, but final, someone comes to open up the door for the cast of Austin Yandres. There are three times of restraint break in two times that we can before the show. And although it is a gorgeous spring day outside, everyone shows up in the dimmedlet's school hallway. And they seem to be about it. You have to look, look, you think. Understand the pulp in this old hussi. No. No, look at it. I remember my glass. Look at this. Mr. Simon is about the wrong kind of orange juice for his cast, this particular day, and Laura and Tiffany are teasing him about that. The cast has been together for five weeks, and they're getting so familiar with each other that they're beginning to function as a kind of hilarious dysfunctional family. And , orange juice really has... Hold that! It's gonna suck! It is slime! Before rehearsal can begin, there have to be... Gross! Announcements. Katie is ordered lost in Yunker's T-shirts for the cast. T-shirts in the various plays that they've been in seem to make up a significant part of the Daily High School wardrobe. This cast. And don't stiff me on this because I don't want to put $15,000 in, so people who say they're going to buy a T-shirt. Well, not $15. $15,000, you need to choose their toys. Money. This is not, , and bang. This is not a bang, that's right. This is actually a little joke. This is not a bang, is a line from the play. As the cast spends more and more time together, they're starting to form the wrong little subculture. Pull of references to the play and jokes that only they get. The Austin Younger's actors can get a laugh out of each other, simply by saying the phrase, General Oywin Rommel, or who was the friend? Friends! And touchingly, it's hard for them not to use these phrases out in the regular lives as well, with people who don't know these lines in the play, they don't know these jokes. When I yell at my mom these days I use lines from the show, we were talking about my grandma and I go, Grandma's crazy, Mom, what did that horse fall on her head? She's so good. So, scary. And if all this just makes the drama kids seem , I'm not just weirdos. Well, you try, for a sudden, same text. Over and over. hours a day for five weeks. And see if it isn't running through your head all the time. Learning and wait for some conversational gap into which it can drive its powerful force. At one point, Kim got the idea they should all go out to eat together at a restaurant, in character. As Tiffany explains, they did drive together in one car, piling into some of these tiny compact whatever. That's what we're taking for seven for the current its family. which is their name and the pride. But then they kind of lost their nerve. They didn't really quite the characters. It's just  they did our accents when we ordered the food. the way it just kind of looked at us funny and that was about it. She didn't really care. But we all had it. We were really pretty funny. The youngest members of the cast are bandmires and max Stewart. They're freshmen. The max is quick to tell you. if you should ask him, that he's been in lots of plays. Drama Club shows in grade school, stretching other way back to as well as Joseph in his first grade Christmas page. Then I went to junior high and they have a much more elaborate, much more professional program with a junior high so and I did a whole bunch of shows there. I got kind of discouraged after I didn't make Westside story but I just bounced right back and went to the next audition. I'm sorry you took it this. You sounded such an old bro. I don't want to sound  I've been in the business for that long, but it's been a few years. I've seen a lot of done-off, but I still got along with you. Actually, I don't  to get all cocky to my own horn here, but I did just, I got asked by someone to understand for a role at the Village Player Steater, which I was very, very honored today this V quartzwell重要, are funny of you over here. village players, sure, they're not a real professional company, sure they're out in the suburbs, they're not down in the city, sure they're all volunteers, but they're adults. Now many boys go out for drama, Eddo Park and River Forest High School, and directors often have trouble filling the male roles. And part of being in high school drama means putting up with friends who do not look too kindly on the entire endeavor. We got a lot of guys, most , I'll show you guys. See you, Eddo. real was seeking to do maybe, , I mean, even talking to them. Ben said, they think it's  a wassee thing to think, no theaters and stuff with ballet. There's a terrible stereotype about all guys in theater or gay. And it's awful because, I mean, , there's one. Yeah. An awkward silence falls amongst the three of us for a moment. Ben seems to know that what they've just said is a little strange. Maybe a little fancy. because it makes an noise as if he's about to save something else. Then he looks at Max, looks down, rocks and plays some other. And decides that he's not going to save him. This show is definitely probably the smallest part I ever had. So it's a lot of waiting around, which can be different calls and just kind of watching everybody else and wishing that I was up there with that. Can play Stena plays and Gurdian's show. It's a small row, but the kind of small character part that can steal entire scenes, Kim wants to be an actress. And while most of the cast is considered acting in theaters, one option for their lives, him is certain. But she suffers from a handicap that the others do not. Her father is professional actor. He does a lot of college industrial films. Actually, he discourages me from it. He doesn't want me to get hurt. It's a reason, but if anything, that's just harder because when I always feel  I have to prove myself to him too I really wish he'd encourage me since it's kind of hypocritical since he does the same thing Oh yeah, oh he's definitely had a hard time at it Especially since a couple of the sprims have made it big time and then He hasn't so that's that's hard for him to watch Here's a go at the shady line see theater in the wrangle island on, the father was in shows with a young David Hasselhoff. And seeing his daughter falling love with the theater, it must be a kind of ordeal. The kind of test that every parent dreads should he discernment her in the things she loves, if it worries himself. But lately, Kim says, he's gone through a big change. It's all right that he's going to introduce her to an agent. It's going to help her get auditions. And then, I mean, my dad has said to me that he's been watching me on stage and sometimes I tear his company's eyes. And just from the say that, and since he always is discouraging me and I'm , I'm not telling me that, , means a lot. See? Tell me where she is. Well, you have a problem. I know that will probably help. From the solvent, I appreciate the help you are doing this for you. No, that's worse, that's worse. Six days before opening them, they run the plate for the first time on the stage, with the beginnings of a set. Cherish representing where furniture will go. And there is a problem. There seems to be no way to put a table and sofa bed on the stage, and still have room for entrances and exits. So, the cast converges on stage. Okay, I'm just told as my arms are all right. Right, in arms. I don't  the exact list house. This is  where the stuff is. I'd say be the furthest corner down. Jeff! Jeff! This would be the next one. Come here. Come here for me. I will know I need somebody that's the largest person's coming out of this butt. Play that. Play that one. what I do to shape her. At this point, a surreal scene is even more surreal. For the next eight minutes, Jeff lays on the floor. He's head under a chair as six people walk around and arguing. He is positive. He is happy. He is. the consummate professional. And this is part of what you do theater in high school. It's not just the place where you can get applause and approval. As Tiffany says, this is the most intense problem solving. The most serious, concentrated work that she does in high school. But for example, the things happening in class that are intense as  that little discussion in your real class. No, never. But , the most debated thing that I've bycraft. whether or not everyone did the homework or not. It's a simulation, it takes. Because it's  a thinking and a physical thing. It's just , you do it. And you do it over and over again. Until it's presented. Shrexy, can you hear me? I've been giving words. Do you give you a one? I'm not hearing you. You're not? No. In the sound closet of the crew guys, the techies, the ride the lights and the sound, and build the set, and handle the props. Anybody who's ever done theater anywhere will tell you about the ancient rivalry between casting crew. There are 45 crew members with three theaters at O Parkhamoo Forest High School, and the constitute kind of a permanent government. Actors come and go, shows them and go. The crew members, they're there, every week. And frankly it can be a little irritating. them. But they actually think that they're all that when the crew really runs the show. At this school, they all have special hall passes. They all answer to a teacher that they all refer to simply as boss. They all insist that you spell crew C.R. U.E. as a motley crew. And don't get that in-law. Senior John Hubert has done 57 shows. Really? In our yearbook pictures, we have our pictures of our arms crossed. right over the left with a cutout of the dinosaur, a stand up light, dinosaur's name is Ralph and the sample is standing. We have literally turned around and walked out of pictures for our yearbook and they said we can have. John says there's a lot of prejudice against grew. Some teachers think that their slackers and smokers and drug users, people don't notice the charity work that does. People don't notice that there are so many more girls are now in grew. that does threatens and good traditions. So the problems that we've had is FEMA crew members have traveled so in fact, the younger classmate usually it's been around two hours to kind of rule with an iron fist. And do you think you said anything in cognitive background girls wanna do it? Oh yeah. They mark a whole lot more than the three days. At that point, you turned back to his own work. Davej. Houston. Da-doa. Enfeitinho Bangladesh рать ание test 한입 é Insights Helil Greta Insights 하지만 All fibers め على is moving ch 찻 use of being this and opening night is just a few nights away. We are right there in a minute. It's a American life, I'm Ironglass. Our story about the Oak Park River Forest High School Production of Lost in Yonkers. Do you? Do you  the night? Oh, yeah, I love it. And then it's before the curtain rises. Laura is still being made up. She's sick with what turns out later to be pneumonia. Let's do something. and is giving her another set of pep talks, but making her character childlike and not too smart. She shivers and runs to the stage. No opening that is complete without some kind of small crisis. For us to new anchors, it evolves a form fitting sleeveless t-shirt that Jeff is supposed to wear on stage. Jeff, get used to the idea. You wear in it. What? You wear in a day go to you have to. You have to. You have to. It's taller than a hell. I don't. There are two types of actors, kind of love nothing more than to reveal more of the round bodies on stage and the kind of can get a little self conscious. Jeff is squarely in that second camp. He thinks he's too big for a tight t-shirt. And on the side of the dressing room, he sits, muttering bitterly, that wearing the t-shirt will hurt his performance. Everyone goes back to the kitchen. There's other shadows and darkens. and the dim blue work lights. For six weeks they planned for this moment, and practiced for it, and wondered about it. And now, the first time, they get to see if they will write, but what will make sense to be audience. And, early in the first scene, it happens. They get their first laugh. We laugh at the fact that everybody calls it all. Yes, I'm not going to speak. What? If you see it's later, chat, please find us. A small time Jewish gangster is supposed to strip to his sleigh with T-shirt. He embutants his outer shirt revealing the tight T-shirt underneath, and there he stops. He never takes off his outer shirt. His character, Uncle Louis, simply decides to climb in bed wearing a dress shirt. Backstage, I catch him. It's just this time it's gonna kill me, but that's not a little  thing to do, but what, I don't think any good outfit really cares what's paying that much attention to me wearing a dress shirt when I go to bed. explain do about her I'm gonna do it. During the mission Mr. Simon came back stage and congratulated all the actors and he told Jeff that he will cure dickless. Still, Jeff got more laughs than anyone in the cast and Mr. Simon resolved yet in a looser fitting to shirt with future appliances. Opening night by any measure was a wildly successful night of theater. They all got laughs. Everyone kept their accents. Everyone remembered their Lawrence. And while everyone was good, my heart still is gonna miss Gow Pardon You don't see that fella again. He may be very nice. He sounds  he's got a lot of weight he ideas And all I'm interested with what? Shay, are you such support me? You said you can't help me promise that you'll withdraw the money. Zeltis guys after He must put that Look impossible be more than that by the way He must be he wants to marry me How are you married him? What else? Children are not my own baby He's just crying. He's not During the big dramatic scenes between Lara and Tiffin, it was just  Mr. Simon predicted that he would be a king drop. He already answered that fine. And after the last scene, after the bowels, they run from the dressing room, up some stairs, through a door, and out into the lobby with a friends and family saw her. Mr. Simon found the mall, he told him to show him justice he granted. And when he spotted Lara, he helped. There. Oh. Well, oh my God. I don't know what to say to you. You were so fabulous. That seemed to be a few in Mama was... I mean, every moment tonight was... I mean, it was the best you've ever been. I mean, I was crying through a half of it. It was... I am so grateful. We have come so far. Really wise. Really wise. And while they stood in the lobby, a pair of young girls, some of the sisters ran up to the different performers, thrilled, star-star, they said a few words and ran off, nervous, and excited.

I had the drama, but I was at a car. This being the case I quickly forgave when informed of the visiting actor hits scheduled a production of Hamlet, set to take place at the amphitheater of the Wally Rose Garden. He himself would direct and play the title hall, but the other parts were up for grabs. We went to the audition and because we were the youngest, Lowe's and I were assigned the roles of the traveling players Hamlet uses debate as Uncle Party. It wasn't the part I was hoping for, but I accepted it before I didn't. I still had a few speeches and planned to use them to the best of my ability, outshining the other actors who were all much older than mine. They were in their twenties and thirties and carried years of experience in such long-running outdoor dramas as the lost colon men, tender as the land. These were professions and I hoped to benefit from their experience, sitting literally to feed as the director, peppering. the lip of the stage, addressing his clenched fist as, for your act. I worship these people, low asleep with him. By the second week of rehearsal she had taken up with Lairty's who she claimed had a real way with the swore. Unlike me she was embraced by the locomotive, attending late night melodies with Kolonia's. Then we'd beibles to make music by הח becoming the of feeling, driving to the lake with a director while Gertrude and Rosencran's made out on the back seat. The killer was that Louis was nowhere near as committed as I was. Her drama-boggles he had pivoted in of a 24-hour flu yet there she was, swimming naked with the director himself while I practiced lines alone in my room. As traveling players it was decided that we would make our entrance tumbling under the stage. And Louis complained that the grass was irritating her skin. The director examined the weed pimples on a back and decided that, rather than tumbling, the players would enter skipping. I practiced my tumble until my brain lost its moring to be hurt rattling in my skull and now, on the basis of one complaint you were skipping. He'd already cut out all of my speeches, leaving me with one line, I, my Lord. While the other actors throught the rose gardens memorizing the vengeful soliloquies, it gets back and forth across the parking lot whispering. I, my Lord, I, my Lord, lowest felt silly skipping spoke to the director who praised or instincts and announced that henceforth, the players would enter walking. The less I had to do, the more my fellow actors used me as a personal slave. I would have been happy to help them run lines, but instead they want to be to polish their crowns or chalked out to the car and sewed the floor boards for... their dagger. Looking for something to do, you can help Doug and go take the stage, the drivers. You can chase the spiders out of the dressing room or better yet, run to the store, who wants drinks? Not only did Lowe's lay in the shade, do we not think that she was the first one to hand me a $20 bill when pricing an order for a 30 cent candy book. During rehearsal breaks, you huddled with the actors while I was off anchoring letters for one of the technicians. When it came time for our big seeing, law was decided her lines as if she were reading the words from the surface of some distant billboard. She squinted and paused, between syllables, punctuating each word with the question mark. If the director had a problem with her performance, he kept it to himself. I, on the other hand, I needed to remove the sweater from around my neck. Walk slow, drop the accent. It might have been easier to accept the criticism, had he spread her to round her with that scene though, might. She could end up a stage with a slice of pizza and one-heon and a doctor pepper and the other, and that was fine, but was just great. By this point I was finding my own way home from the rehearsal. Lois couldn't give me a ride if she was always rushing off to some party or restaurant, with what she referred to as, again from Ellison or. I would wave them off in the parking lot, one of my parents driving home. The thing to remember my mother said, is it 10 years from now on? could wake up underneath when these people and have no idea you'd ever even seen them before. Time passes, you'll see, enough liquor and people can forget anything. Don't let it get you. If nothing else, it's taught you to skin the change while buying your drinks. I didn't appreciate or casual attitude, but the business with the change was insidious. My mother had a vengeful part down, it was the craft of acting I thought she knew nothing about. We were in dress rehearsal when the director approached low-wars and regards to a production he had planned for the fall. This was to be a musical based on the lives of rogue in gypsies, and he had her in mind for the role of a lasty bandit. Lowest couldn't sing, everybody knew that. Neither could she act or apply the tambourine. I watched the man kneel down in the glass and literally beg her to accept the park. interest he suggested I might enjoy walking behind the scenes in some backstage capacity. He meant for me to hang lights or log-seem, to turn into one of those guys with low-widing pants and a belt burden with wrenches and thick walls of gaffers to him. Anyone thinking I might be trusted with electrical one had to be completed, and that's what this man was. I looked at him clearly then. noticing how his tights made a mockery at his slack calves and don't be a little basks. If he was such a big, stinking dino, what was he doing well in North Carolina? His blow dried hair, the Cuban heel shoes and rainbow stripes suspenders, it was all the shaham.

My mother stretched out beside him, fighting off the marves, who, long enough, a few dozen humans, invented cracked by the fight night. There was a cast party afterwards that I didn't go. I changed my clothes in the dressing room where the actor stood, congratulated one another. Horatio asked me to run to the store for some cigarettes, and I pocketed his money, promising to return the fight in the sea. You were the best in a whole shelf, my mother said, stopping for frozen pizza on her way. I mean it, you walked under that stage and all eyes went right for it. It occurred to me then that my mother was a better actor than I could have hoped for. Acting is differently posing and pretending. When done well, it fares a striking resemblance to lying. I didn't envy my mother's skill, neither did I contradict her. That's how convincing she was. It seemed fast, sitting beside her with a frozen pizza, See you in peace! sit back and heart.

We'll do the way I put him into the suburbs. The stage area is half and by off of the entrance. When we reached those seats, I saw there was a despack of shade before they have to do it.
