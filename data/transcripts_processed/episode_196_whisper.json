  "text": "Marrike Eulie is one of those guys from chocolate. And more you try to explain to what it is that he does for a living. More you think people pay you for that. He can tell us with companies about innovation, but how to organize themselves to become more competitive and competitive. Cost in new ideas that come from. So February, last year, it's getting a talk about ons. Some executives gather and pants off for some time. And after the talk, two military men asked him to launch. It's being served. One of them asked what he knew about 1993 farming. Well, traits and authority. So he's asking me if I knew any of the details, and I said no. He started to tell me the core details about the analysis of that body. And of course, what they use are people who go in afterwards into forensic analysis, or call, and what was fascinating about the forensic analysis, is that the forensic teams didn't quite agree. Some said the bombs were placed. 12. centimeters away from where they would have needed to be to destroy the major support town. I was saying no no no yeah it all wrong. For a cent of me. I'm the way. I'm the way. Pretty long. It turns out that one of the guys I'm once he went. So major general. George close. Brilliant guy. And he turns out to be hand picked by chairman of the joint chiefs. Could get my data out of this, according to employee stands yet. And if花 separated this important point, then even if there's the Laurier letter but then they couldn't move because some of the important people don't have to take JCC, and it seeks to continue. And when this theory doesn't show up he can eat to have a think through something called Revolution in Military Affairs. When I got a little bit of explanation about this revolution in North Carolina affairs, they said, we're in the middle of Honduras, okay, Eastern, they said, they don't happen and we think there's been maybe 12 of them in the military. What that means is that everything... that is in one in the way we engage fight a conflict and win it, look off and refuse. So one of that early historic examples was the intention of gunpowder. And , you think about the world of gladiator. You see the kind of conflict that gunpowder and form forever. People that are rushing up to the end of the night. Of course. wearing 300 pounds of armor and rushing up the moon, whacking in with something sharp, that's what, that was the nature of battle in those days. Well gunpowder comes along, cannons get cheap, put them on wheels and haul them to the enemies, fortress, that's a revolution in those areas. And I'm sitting there listening to this, and they've happened so south of the world. Oh, every time. a revolutionary affair occurred in history. Party empowered it, begin, it's not empowered. And they got a lot of this thought and turned. Your nose historians have convinced the senior generals that we were in the midst of a revolution in all territories, with these basic principles. Which brings us to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. These particular generals were convinced that it was an example of this new kind of warfare, the way the thing was organized, the web of operatives, the low tech way was carried out. In fact, that it was on American soil, targeted at something so symbolic, the World Trade Center towers. February of last year, this kind of kind of officials trying to think about how they should fight back, and they wanted to learn to think differently. They wanted to learn to think  their enemy. So they caught on a bunch of guys and hired. it's a bit  Kiwi per advice on how to think different, how to change. US military strategy right now, based on the idea that we will win wars through overwhelming force. That's the idea, overwhelming force. We will throw all the bombs, planes, and missiles at the enemy, the best technology that money can buy, and a lot of it, just simply overwhelming, and they full out of the tank. And Kiwi says that it was not clear if the Pentagon could change, just something so low tech and sneaky. One of the things we have is money, material, and space. to challenge elite forces to be able to overcome a vastly superior in the next enough. That is just completely the opposite of the way we think. And it's logical that we wouldn't think that way. As we start with the presumption where the mightiest and biggest graves move, right. You send them in order to fight this concept of go-go. to be a lawyer's actions. They have to become guerrilla terrorists. I don't know if they have to become them, but they have to be booked at 3 o'clock. Tugly says the military brass city talks to the point to be able to do that. But also in a quite well-haed difficult level. It is hard to imagine world, someone else is pointing to you. Today on our radio program, we try to do that. We bring you three stories. Stories? kind of current events rush them on. Each of the stories in our show today is something that you have heard of in the news. And we invite people with a different perspective, of course, than the one you are already know. WB's Ishkado, this American life, distributed by public radio international, I'm a regular glass. But I've heard them today in three acts, act one, a thousand and one, a rabion, 19 newscasts, Palestinian teenager from Chicago in that story explains why everything that you think  about the world's trade center in Pentagon attacks is absolutely wrong. Act 2, bombs are for Baghdad. We are the story of the Persian Gulf War, told by a family man from Baghdad who was drafted into Saddam's army against his will, who had to explain to his three-year-old son, whether there's nice Americans or bombing their city night after night. Act 3, Poto, I don't think we're in Vietnam anymore. US Special Operations Forces will lead the first part of the coming war that we are out praising for. We hear how a simple half-hour mission turned into a bloody... all day battle, one of the last times they went out, just for years ago, stay with us. Heck 1, 2001, a radiant night evening, just as. If I'm asking what Arab Americans or Muslims think about recent news is as ridiculous as asking what Christians, there is no one in the question, it's a question. For this next story we wanted to hear from somebody who's used to not necessarily agree with what. most Americans. We did this specifically so that we could better understand why they believe what it is that they believe. I send your producer Julie Snyder visited with an 18 year old Palestinian American in Brawa, starting the week of the attacks of the World Trade Center. Brawa is a freshman in college, a student of the future, from parents. So we're as more traditional close at home, genes in sweatshirt at school. She's religious enough that she always keeps her head here's Julie. Whenever I visit Brawa's family's apartment, to TV is always on. They only watch the Arabic satellite channels. There are 10 or 15 of them from Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates. There are movies, soap operas, there's even an Egyptian version of who wants to be a millionaire that is almost exactly the same as ours, but in their version, instead of cash prices, you win bars of gold. There, as here, some newscasts are more reliable than others. Al-Jazeera is sort of  CNN. Abu Dhabi is close to the public. Three days after the attacks, it's Rawa her mother, brother, sister, brother and mom and me, sitting on the couch watching up and up. The scene on the TV is  watching the news in the parallel universe. It's a reporter doing the stand-up in front of the charred and collapsed portion of the Pentagon, just  any other reporter. Except he's speaking in Arabic, talking emotional, ingestering the fact he sang. The US doesn't have proof linking the attacks to Arabs, and there seems to be almost no proof link. in the attack to the sum of the mod, but that everyone in the United States is jumping to conclusions. On hearing the news, Rob was family nons in a green. Her brother-in-law turns to remind me of the Oklahoma City bombing, where immediate reports pin the blame on Arabs. The Arabic channels have been talking about this and about to be in phase-recent execution and how these attacks might be related to that. He talks about various American militia groups I've never heard of that want revenge from phase execution. I tell him I am. not know much about that. He tells me it's reported all the time. This is the 12 o'clock news. This is Rower. This report saying that Israel is taking advances of all the media tuning to America and reporting what's happening. And they are. bombing more homes and killing more Palestinians in Palestine. In fact, in the first few days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Israel did step up military actions in the African territories. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Rurala's sister lives. Israel is launched missiles from helicopters and leveled a building used by a Palestinian intelligence. Killing one person in the Indian 120 meters. Rurala's sister called to say that she and her son have been sleeping in the laundry. because it's the only room that one knows. Naturally, this was big news on AirBert TV. And while it was reported by Western news agencies  UPA and Reuters, because of the trade-centered Pentagon attacks, it was hardly mentioned in American's case in newspapers. While on her family say, this is typical, Americans who pay close attention to the news hear about Israeli actions against Palestinians. But most of us don't really know these things are happening, and don't get a sense of how severe they are, and this is the next video. is that American channels? I have the Syrian, the Lebanese, the Dubai channels, the Kuwait, the Syrian Arabia, the Iraq, so all these children are bringing it. I'm sure there's no line. Something can burn by many channels. When I first met Rowan, she's been over an hour showing me a rounder house. I'm sure I'm the only one showing me a rounder house. and explaining to me her views on these Brailleux and their occupation palasin. We looked at articles she had written with a local Muslim newspaper, she played me a video she had put together off the satellite TV, showing children brutally killed by Israeli shells and Israeli soldiers shooting farmers at the point point rage. The footage was really graphic, filled with blood and body parts. You'd never see footage  it on American TV. Rao's presentation even went more time earlier. This is a PowerPoint slidesh. I have gotten the email and persons of Tumblr where the is your earliest was start taking the Palestinians. This is a picture of a boy in a high school. This is a boy who was shot in the head. The reason these stories don't appear in the American media Rallis says is because certain ethnicities in the media and that's the phrase she don't want these stories to get out. Now, her family said the same thing to me, meant that the mosque around the corner from her house set it to. After I'd spent a few hours with Rauhous family, the praise, certain ethnicities, just short-d into, Jews. The fact that they'd say this to a member of the supposed Zionist mediators, just shows how hard it is for them to imagine any other explanation for the way Arabs are portrayed in the news. I think it didn't even occur to them that it might be offensive. And I've all this seems bigger than hard to talk. while it consider how it looks from their side. While we're here is about all sorts of news from our sister, from Arabic TV, that is either downplayed or ignored in the Western Middle. What else could it explain? Ali Abu Nima runs a website where you track and hire a bias in the American media. He doesn't think there's a Jewish conspiracy skew in the coverage, but he says people believe it because in their day-to-day experience is real seems capable. will appoint anything odd. Sure, Israeli-seed themselves as the underdogs, at tiny states surrounded by hostile neighbors, but from a Palestinian perspective, nothing seems beyond Israel's reach. I think there's an issue of power here. When you have an overwhelming, powerful force  Israel, and people who've lived on the operation, people who's an entire life is controlled by the whim of this power with... you can get up in the morning go to work, is up to the mood of the Israeli soldier checkpoint, whether your house will be demolished, is up to the Israelis, whether you're allowed in or out of the country is up to the Israelis, whether you're allowed to go from this village to that village is up to the Israelis. Everything is up to the Israelis. So people experience these Israelis as a powerful overwhelming powerful force. And in fact, these railways have always tried to inculcate that people the myth of invisibility, the Israeli secret service, the Mossad, that it has this omnipotence, which a lot of people believe, especially when they're in a much weaker position. , you might believe a lot of things. And look at what Israel has already convinced people out of the seas. Most of the West believes the creation of the state of Israel was completely fair and unjust and inspiring story. refugees from World War II in the Holocaust, we finally got a state. From an era perspective, it's incredible. It's so different from the experience of Palestinians who are often brutally and forcefully expelled. And people say, look, how Israel got away with doing this to us and getting the world to believe something different. And if they can do that, and that most fundamental instincts, then what can't they do? All these palestin and believes that the biases of the Western press aren't necessarily things the reporters' reading conscious. Consider the fact that no foreign journalists covering Israel, Palestine, live in the occupied territories. I think there's one I think what the economists do. correspond with lives in Gaza or at least used to. So what happens is that when a reporter goes there, they become functionally speaking in Israeli. , they live amongst Israelis. The children go to Israeli schools. They wake up in the morning, they're going to get the cup of this round of Israelis. And so that she is become those of Israelis. They remember an NPR reported being interviewed about. how she cubs the fear of suicide box. She said, well, I and my friends, , we go out a bit less. So we do that. She was speaking as in the first person. So there's no reported who can speak in the first person as to what it's  to be a Palestinian. So there's an issue of perspective. It's not that there's conscious bias. But, , if you're living in one place, it's totally different. It's  a first world requirement. as West Jerusalem is. You're going to have a very different perspective. A few days after the September 11th, I gave Robert a tape report to keep the kind of audio diary for a while about a weekend she reports. Q. interested in eggboards? Q. Alright.. Okay, right now it's... minute Whew. And as soon as they got home, my mom told me that on the air recital, they brought that about 4,000 Israeli people that are employed in the World Trade Center did not go to work in the country. And area sure about what's supposed to be in a meeting in New York on Tuesday, but he cancelled. Also, So there were Jews, photograpers on top of the building, some of the few buildings, they were getting ready to picture. So the assumption now is that the Jews are going to shoot it. A couple days after Rauh was recorded, I was invited to her house for a lunch room for her sister in law sister who was visiting from Jordan. Lots of people, huge trays of food were laid out and coffee didn't go in. and toddlers and kids swam to them. At the very end, as we were clearing the dishes, one woman asked me, how come the government and the media are always blaming the Arabs for everything, when they have hardly any evidence? Have you heard about the 4,000 Israelis who didn't show up for working well-trades in an untrusted game? And then again later, after all of the women had gone, where I was brother and walking off her, he runs an Islamic community group and wanted to give me some press releases that have been packed with. And then coming there probably didn't matter. and then I wouldn't report it in white. But had I heard about the 4,000 Israelis in the World Trade Center? It's not clear how widely believed this from the Philippines. It appears to have originated on the Hamas website, yes, they have a website. And then was spread on Elmanar, the Lebanese TV channel, that on the news broadcasts, but on the college shows viewers would phone in repeat of the rumors of the truth. There's no calling of Arabs or... Arab Americans on these kinds of things, but of the five representatives of Arab American organizations I spoke to. All of them had heard of this room, and all of them said it's not why they believed here in the States. Lots of groups get more play. For instance, there was a rumor a few months ago that McDonald's was donating its profits to Israel. His spokesman for the Arab American anti-deformation movement Washington, says he got over 4,000 in, also about that. By comparison, he's received only 15 or 20 miles on the slip. one. One reason Rauhis family believes the rumor is true is this, who benefits from the attacks on the wall trade center? Not the Arabs this, not the Muslims. Instead, Rauhis says that up until this point, the war in the Middle East has been between the Arabs and the Israelis. But this September 11th attack she sends will necessarily bring U.S. into that war, turning an Arab is really war into an Arab and a Arab. and war . As far as she's concerned, this is what Israel has wanted all along. This is why she says Israel would attack the U.S. but frame the Arabs from the country. So now, no Israeli name has been mentioned of one of the news. Nobody has been reported that they were hurt, but  what, actually after you and I had talked, I went through and looked at names of people who were missing and there are. Jews missing. There are. There are. There are. Yeah. And that we're killed in that building. Yeah. Well, how about the employees that did not go to work that day? But if it was true that there were 4,000 Israelis who worked at the World Trade Center and didn't show up for work that day, that would mean that one in 15 people who worked at the World Trade Center are Israeli, which is just. not true. what I'm saying? I see what you say and I don't know who did it exactly and no one knows yet because no one in the world yet have any real evidence of who had attacked the world face up. At this point, 130 Israelis are still officially unaccounted. The confirmed Israeli death surveys, two passengers on the hijacked points and the body of a third Israeli found in the world train set. All the other men says no one he knows, believes the rumor about the 4,000's reigns, but he's part of the rumors' appeal, is that it takes the heat off. , one of the first feelings I had, many others, is, please, God, don't let this be so unfamiliar at least. And we don't want it to be. We don't, we don't, we, we discern, we renounce this act. This is a horrific atrocity, a crime against humanity was committed in New York. So saying it's a Z. The finest conspiracy is a way to dissociate yourself from it completely. , if people supported it, they'd be saying, yeah, , strike one for the Muslims, no one is saying that they're all looking for a way out. Wereたhte sandboxing Rather which can't believe a Muslimmen behind 2 times. A coronavirus had no idea that the other women were. A huge success. A country with criminals can't realise how to read vampires for true explanation. ي Re sim Sachen Psychological value Ik��e seems to be the biggest difference between the way people from Arab countries use events and the way most Americans It's not about the rumors, it's about a solid democracy Most of the Arab Americans I spoke with are still waiting for proof linking you to the tax For some sort of hard evidence to be released to the public and there's skeptical it'll have a count Probably what has been Latin is just a piece Now I wouldn't you surprise at this Halloween you have kids and people just as a symbol that strongly so I went to Dominic's other day and I was shopping nice to all these pumpkins and pastens, it does differing the decades of my mind because Americans now are afraid of something called a symbol that or something is called Mohammed or Islam or Arabs powers flowerpills is is all powerful and capable of everything she sees as a matter. Most Americans wouldn't agree with their content. Meanwhile, from an Arab point, we're doing the same thing as some of the modern. He seems all powerful, we're ready to believe it was him. Even if we haven't seen the guys put. Maybe everyone needs to believe me. Julie Snyder. Saddle West No. up to the sky things  that dry and the edge of my mind I watched four little ones I liked to watch things on TV fall act Digital He's some sugary as an architect living at Toronto, but during the Persian Gulf War he looked in Baghdad, we grew up, experienced the world's quasi-different person. Here, remember clearly how we got into his country had a fatal story. Me and my wife used to work in two different rooms in the same sort of building, and she always listened to a waiting station, being the national waiting station, because it has some more fun. songs and mixed-urof songs and stuff  that. But anyway, so she was trying to find that station. But she couldn't, and she said, it seems there's something wrong with the radio I can't find that station. So I started to flip through the stations and I put it on our, , bag of station. And boy, I started to hear the marshes and the militaries. And did that automatically mean  you knew those trouble? Yes, yeah that was the government sort of announcement in music. Well, at the time of trouble, we sense it when we first was here, , emotional love songs, we think that regime is taking the break a little bit. So at the time we heard that. And instantly we knew that there was militant or something from. I heard about the invasion by Dashin' out to the streets, what happened to you? People very involved in this news attack. It's quite... It's gone people to find me. I was really good at it. I started to talk about it and I said, not again. Had you served in the Iran Iraq War? Yes, I served for three years, and that was a course that it incredibly was your estimates of the dead range to one hand, rock, use chemical weapons, or, did you talk about what it felt  to know that you were being called up to get to fight in this conflict? for somebody who you didn't support. I don't know, it's the most individualistic as well as a collective miserable experience you will ever. Because you are facing actually not one thing. You are facing to it. So I'm not back. And when you turn to ran away, you see it in the back. I can try to shoot you. That is the government. I couldn't picture myself putting on the same uniform and fighting for the nation. That is the Federation. So that was my feeling and next day I'm going to have to go to that literacy. I was enjoying the process as I was not having this situation. of K-dating, backward font, in the end inside the city of Fakim. That's what you were very lucky. I was actually a bit somewhat of my new team. Plasma in Fakim, it was sent out in Fakim's font, some of them fleece the book. It's taking my child. Did they say that the same concept was about the same age of Fakim? That gray outfit they wears is the decoration suit from the city. Talk about the experience. Did you talk about what that was a few were in Baghdad when the US started 30-day air tempings? Right. Actually, at the time we were waiting because James Baker the town warned you, we were going to be too bad. to live in. And everybody in Europe, but nobody believed it. Nobody believed it? Yes, yes, we didn't believe that is going to happen. It's one hand, it's over 100 countries, gathering their forces with a non-unprecedented a show of force and the human history. Against 22 million people, and we couldn't believe that this is my life. This is my life. It could be a two or I couldn't believe that the representative of the most so-called civilized country with atoms such, such, nonsense, for getting for that. So where were you in Bamekir, in the end? Yeah, I was in my home with my one, my son three-year-old son, and that was raining. I was  two years, three years married to my wife. I was sort of dividing my family home into two little homes. One is for my sister and one is for my family. And as a sure for emotional support, we all slept, we had mattresses on floor in my living room, which was  a chat door. was open because I was renovating at the time, , I thought I brought a lot of pain to pain my living room. So anyway, we slept in that night in the night of the 17th Jan Jan in my living room and we started kissing each other and we fell asleep exactly to a young man. We all work on the ground and shaking. and it was  a deep deep burn sort of echo happening coming down from the ground. And the light that the street lights was on were on at the time and in five minutes they were on all the lights around. And we, and that minute we were searching that this is the one where we're back in work facing death all over again. I personally, I am not ashamed of this. I started to shave my hands, couldn't hold anything. I grabbed my... Fix. I grabbed my little kid. And here's crying, didn't know I... See? I remember my son when he heard the beef too, however he's his head. I put my hand on his heart and I felt his heart bumping  crazy. And I really can't can't I went to the wash last five, six times. In five minutes,  when you have this kind of stress. , I need to go to the wash. As my day and as this is, but I need to tell the Americans about me. The fear of here is very, very frightened when you're expecting your death. It's much more frightening that when you're, when it happens suddenly. If you're, if you're asleep or if you're embarking on your work or whatever, when you're expected minute by minute, , second by seconds. sometimes it gets  a torch, we were literally torn shirt and I was started to wonder with the streets, I looked around in my neighborhood and by the way our neighborhood looks pretty much  any American or Canadian neighborhood, , row houses or individual homes with front yards and very nicely done. , people that has the same quality. of life for differences that they live in constant fears. And you are with your three-year-old boy. And well actually I was very worried about this guy because he was very young and you know when he was here. When he started your life by experience, he was here, bombing. You would leave scars and so forth for the rest of your life. I think I... I think he's fine, no, but he kept asking what way are they doing this to us. Let's have a look at what we've done. And I couldn't find the right answer because he was very young at the time I could go to the political analysis. It's wrong, but here. It's 12. There is a bad guy who did something wrong. And there are some judges of the world who we would... wanted to take the low by their hand and then they come and punish him. But then I stopped for one second, but they are punishing us. But we aren't scared. He's not scared. Did he ask why are they bombing all of us? If we're just trying to get this bad man? Well, I didn't try to justify what the American court. is where doing. Yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm not gonna polish my words. I told him that, , after days and days of bombing, I first told him that, well, there are some judges who are gonna catch this man, he's an outlaw. Are they gonna put him in jail? I try to make things story to visit. And then after that, I started to feel frustrated myself because I see people surrounding him in front of my eyes and I think. And so down there comes out in the screens, nothing with his ugly face. So I started to tell him, well those judges are sometimes more severe and sometimes they hit hard that the people themselves will suffer some injuries but again that's okay, probably in the end they were catching but it never happened. And now he... knows that it's not going to happen neither in Iraq nor in Afghanistan or in Iran. Was there a part of you which hope that the Americans succeed and integrate Iraq, from some of us? To tell you the truth, I hope so, I hope so. But I felt deep deep in heart that they're not going to catch this person. I've always doubted that and not only me, all the people in Iraq. doubted that, because there is always history that tells you lessons, and there is the fresh memory when Saddam bombed chemically, used the chemical weapons against Halapcha, which is in northern, very, very peaceful city in 1988, and killed 5,000 people in 2 hours. Nobody in the West raised a finger, nobody called him a terrorist, nobody called him a tyrant, but when he touched, , state that is a strong ally to the west, , , the state that has the very rich in oil. Everybody, so we didn't have real trust to the west. It's a feeling that those people do not care about other nations. They can bomb any city, any minute, any time without warms. And what did you think about the United States? That time, did you 18-19 states? Farming, did you? Did you feel on max appearance? And then, as you hope that they will come in, I didn't  it. Nice, as a government, it's military, it's not people. I saw Christmas songs for non-buildings that are sick and I'm watching the whole series. It's actually to me  the World Trade Center. When I saw the World Trade Center, those were their... as crashing in the first thing jumped into my head was when I saw one of the buildings I was driving from one part of the city to the other and I saw one of these buildings on Christmas song. But some of these buildings were inhabited by civilians. So I do not hate, I do not hate, I do not  to be this one. But I was mad, I was angry at a nice state government because. use a lot of smart or inhuman forms to punish very poor people. And where you also angry at sit-down for putting your own disposition, oh, in that respect we paid it sit-down. I would definitely use that one. This I'm sure created it right. In the spare time, it has a little work with it. It's trying to get the economic sanctions, stop the absence of your own terror. Go inside the door. 5,000 svg i every month. 5,000 every month. Coming up, we're head and lessons from the half I was out of here. In 1993, in the minute, I'm proud of how great I am. How a great year international. One up. This American life is my first day on our program, current events, Russia, which will get familiar news stories from unfamiliar points today of my shit's writing. We have to go back three, back three, total, we've been told that the first part of becoming war on terror, on the US special operation, and we're talking about suspected terrorists. Perhaps we'll be helpful to remember another mission  that, as well. In the early 1990s, there was a UN peace-keeping mission in Somalia. In that country, there were a number of rival factions of the power. In June of 1993, the officers had the68 injection English and killed 19 power text and researchers from the Russian mission. According to administration, the speech described as special act of social insurance, the SNL's, the speech of the social insurance. The squad consisted of two elite military teams and the English, the ultimate force. On October 3, 1993, their mission was to capture two of the idea's pop-on-anders, marked out and wrote a book about that, or the black-hop-down. He talked to producer Alex Bloomberg about that. The mission captured us. They had been spotted speaking at a rally. and moved to the city earlier that morning. We had been observed by spies on the ground and in the air, traveling to a house in the center of Mogadishu in an area called the Potama. And so, General William F. Garas was the leader of Pascar's Range. Authorized a raid, which was to swoop in very quickly on this house, and arrests to guys in any way who is with and bring them back. and the mission was supposed to hit. It didn't exactly work out the mission. No. The idea, the mission was envisioned as taking about 30 minutes. Basically, 30 minutes on the ground, and maybe another 30 minutes to convoy the prisoners out of the city. In the end, how long have you been in the past few months? In the end, the battle lasted about 15 hours through a long night. We ended it early. We'll be back today. 18 American soldiers were killed. It was the most significant firefight that American soldiers have been all hit since they weren't here. The way the raid was set up, the Delta Force operators would hit the ground first on they ride on benches on the outside of these little helicopters in each six, probably little parts. And are literally put right down in front of the house thing land right on the street. So the Delta Force operators were inserted in that. And then bigger, the bigger black rock helicopters come in. The black rocks are too big to land on the street, so they hover over head. When the Rangers roped down to each of the four corners of the block, where the separation was taking place, what was the set of the first in it that didn't go according to it as planned. Well, as the Rangers roped into the four corners, one of the young Rangers fellow named Todd Blackburn actually missed the rope in fell 70 feet on the helicopter. And fell 70 feet on the helicopter. Street. Now this was the most serious injury that any of these units have sustained since they come much more and it caused  certainly a great deal of law and within this little small little range of you there and it set in motion a chain of events that kind of just slowed the whole process down. Not a lot but one of the very first things in the book is when talking about them. They're hanging from these helicopters in these ropes. There's 70 feet above the ground that slide down these ropes. and then sort of establish their position. And just the confusion of it all was just particularly  what do they see as they're coming down? Well initially as the men descended the ropes to the street, they could see almost nothing because the helicopters, the blackhacks are so powerful, they kicked up huge clouds of dust. So they're roping down in a dust storm so they can't really even see much past their nose. And they're hearing for the first time pretty heavy fire. When you, , the sound of bullets that pass very closely make a lot of cracking notes  a piece of hickory being snapped. So, the only way you can tell how close it is by the sound it makes. That's what they told me. I've never fortunately been in a situation where people have been shooting at me, but there's sort of a wishing sound that you hear if the bullets pass somewhere in your vicinity, but if it's close enough to you hear what's essentially a little sonic boom as the round that does pass. And of course they say the one that hits you, you never. And most of the guys were learning this for the first time on this mission. That's right, these are very young soldiers. They're well trained and very cocky and very capable. But they had never been exposed to fire  this and they had never seen the guys next to them suddenly start to drop. Man Ever's nun who was putting charge of this mission for the first time. And by one, the men in his unit scattered around this street where they just landed. beginning to sustain injuries. Take a shot. Take a shot. One of them gets a thumb shot off, another good shot in the shoulder. He starts seeing his men go down. So this was a very, very dangerous place to go. The rules of engagement were that the American soldiers were not allowed to shoot it somewhere unless they were pointing their weapons at them. And so the Somalis knew the rules of engagement. So they mingled in with the angry crowds who were not on. So that they could fire at the Rangers without the Ranger being able to shoot back at them. It was literally a scene where one of the Rangers was confronted with a Somali gun who was laying on the ground and he had children sitting on top of them. I think he had a woman standing right in front of him. He had basically surrounded himself with non-combatants so that he could lay there and shoot at the Rangers without being shot at himself. And actually what the Ranger in this situation did was lay down a line of f***. the fire, right in front of this man, the children in the women fled very quickly and then they shot the gun. But eventually, , they were under so much fire that the rules of engagement were just dropped because they realized that they had to shoot back if they didn't, they weren't going to survive. So if somebody's young men were in the position of having to shoot at crowds of people in order to avoid being killed themselves. So then what happened after that? Well, they proceeded to evacuate. type Blackburn. The Rangers fan-out formed the perimeter  they were supposed to. They began coming under more and more fire as the minutes went by. The Delta Operators arrested the people they were looking for. They found them and handcuffed them and were leading them out of the building. When one of the Blackhawk telecoctors that was still circling over head, was hit by a rocket propelled grenade and crashed four blocks away. All of the men involved in this mission are communicated with themselves by radio. All of these conversations were tapered for it. One of the things that I found remarkable about, we've listened to the audio tank, is here doing tensed to be at that moment. When that black hot telecopter crashes, here men shouting into the radio, we've got a black hot down, and we can hear the panic. You've already got another key. If you're on the ground in a city with literally thousands of that tens of thousands of people surrounding the shooting at you, Your faith in getting out of there alive rests largely on those helicopters over here. There are symbols for you of the fact that you are there representing the most powerful military force in the world. When the Black Hawk was shut down, that was the defining moment of this episode. The idea was to insert the man to take the prisoners, load them on vehicles and drive them on the city and everyone had the word to come back and come to the barbecue. Once there were a shot. went down everything changed because now they had men down on the ground either dead, wounded or fighting for their lives and they had to try to rescue those moments with distress. And so basically the con boy which originally and plant just the back space with the prisoners. Now has a totally different solution. Well, this became one of the major phases of the battle and certainly the bloodiest phase. Once the black hawk was shut down, the orders were for the convoy to load up the prisons and then drive to the neighborhoods where the black hawk crashed. And the idea was then to rescue the men who had been all aboard that helicopter and then drive out of the city. But the problem was that the streets of Mogadishua COVR. and this point there are smallities setting up burning barricades and organizing ambitions and intersections. So it as the conboard began to try to make its way to be down blackhawk, it got lost. It became a tragic comedy of errors. with pilots in the helicopters over head and there was a of Navy plane, a key three-oli and flying pilot overhead. All of them trying to give directions to this convoy, but because of the, in some cases, the relay system of communicating to them, they would, the people in the vehicles would get the instructions to take advantage of. So for instance, someone, I overhead would say take a left and by the time that back at that, they would communicate with them. But the vehicle they had already passed on, where they were supposed to take. The men in the vehicles in the rear of the cardboard didn't even know what was going on. The vehicle was in the rear of the cardboard. Didn't even know what was going on. a lot of them still thought they were driving out of the city because no one had communicated to everybody down the line exactly where it was they were going what they were trying to do. So you have these men hold up to these vehicles one by one getting injured or killed and not knowing where they were going why they were making the turns they were making. And it's not something you can stay inside but Humvee is actually that much protection. Right, the convoy was made up of... of two, five-ton trucks, five-bed trucks, with prisoners in the back, and six-ably six humbese. And they discovered that rounds could go right through the skin of a humbese, first one of a humbese took a direct hit from a rocket propelled grenade, which penetrated through the side and exploded in the back, blowing the men who were in the back of the humbese out the rear of the vehicle out on the street. A couple of those men were killed. if the others were severely injured, whenever anything  that would happen, the convoy would stop, the men would all have to pile out. They would try to rescue the men, or injured, get back on the vehicles, start up again. Every time they would stop, they would come under heavy fire. Until finally, more than half of the men on that convoy were either dead or injured. And it's especially hard-backing when you read because several times, convoy swings, a walk away. From other capped people out. And it just shows. you how chaotic the situation was on the street. There was this feeling expressed by one of the Air Force comeback controllers who was in one of the vehicles, he just felt he couldn't understand what was going on and he just believed they were going to keep driving around until they were all dead. , one of the things is it's sort of at this point in the box and one of the things that's very clear is that it's almost as if the entire Now I don't want to see time to guess because I thought that's not the right one It's  that is it yeah, I mean the ranger said that it felt  it was kill an American day in Mogadishu There was so much anger and possibility toward these merriest truths that it virtually was true That they were trapped in a city where everyone in the city it seemed was trying to fill and this is not just the normal city This is the most heavily armed population probably within the world. And so they were under the chance of fire from 360 degrees. You think they had a sense of the enormous hostility that was pent up out there? I think that they probably were aware that there was hostility against them, but they couldn't have imagined the intense. You have to remember these are the best train soldiers in the world. They have the best equipment. They have these helicopters which are absolute. of military technology to support them. So they had, I think, a really cocky at it. The idea that they were fine themselves so outnumbered and outgun and at a disadvantage in a place  Mogadishu, where they viewed the people that were fighting against as just a rag tag bunch of irregularness. They wouldn't know how to put together the salt if they liked. Now, though they probably themselves, and really, they've predicted that for which a lot of them had no reason to expect to be alive. , clearly, from what everybody can say about the situation, for the current situation. And Afghanistan is that the military part of the response is the problem to involve, almost certain to involve special operations for some of them, maybe already on the ground in Afghanistan. Say Primaese Exactly Week sighs. If you were to bring more rubbish codeander during real life stuff, I mean... as many as I want, actually. Now believe me, NOT第二 fayr. 3 absorbs and grams in an iron. Well, in fact, involving the same units of the someplace, the same myth. What thoughts do you have about that? , what I hope Blackhawk Down, the book Blackhawk Down does is sober people up to the reality of topics. And I'm not arguing, and I don't think the book argues, makes a pass of this story. That you shouldn't be using that with a third course. I think we clearly are in a position right now where the moral obligation. the problem with the Battle of Mogadishu was that none of this civilian leadership in the United States from the President's Congress had imagined that these raids could turn out with so many people to kill Lynch. So their response when this happened was one of horror that this was a disaster and so immediately President Putin called off the military mission and Mogadishu. But from a note? the military objective was to capture Hassan O'Wale and Omar Salad. They were both captured and evacuated from the city and were in custody of the end of day. And I think it was going to the military's particular commitment to pardon this. To have this mission viewed as a debacle because they felt that they had been successful. And they felt that after so much sacrifice. their strong desire was to stay finished in the mission. If only the honor of the memory of the man who killed the accomplishing, it marked the Pentagon. Did they study the spatt? Did they sort of look at it and  more years later, say, okay, what happened here, what were, what went on, what if things were going on? Well, much to my amazement, I don't think that the army seriously studied this episode at all, it's better at all, and it just boggles my mind when consider that this is probably the only instance of serious real world fighting that American soldiers had do certainly since the Persian Gulf War. And there was nothing this even in the Persian Gulf War. And you would think just from a standpoint of evaluating the effectiveness of weaponry of armor tactics that they would want to examine very carefully what happened here. , I found myself in a position when I was working on this book what represented in形. the first person who had attempted to really examine exactly what happened in detail. Mark Badden is an out battle for movie issues but Mark Badden is a member of the world of media. The 160 Americans in the fight 7300 team got servited estimate of the number of smallies dead. This is where the helicopter's came.
