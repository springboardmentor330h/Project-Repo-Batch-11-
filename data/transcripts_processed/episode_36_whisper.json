I've been procosiously reading the New Yorker for some time now, and I am a devotee of the current magazine as well as the, as well as the historic part. Most of the writers I respect most living and debt have written for your magazine that's in time. I will wait to put my journalistic and literary tutorials where I can't job at the new work, but I'm determined to end up newer as. The resume I've proposed doesn't indicate this, but I've been working with the freelance writers since graduated two months ago. I've been doing pretty well, but I'm still waiting for the big score. Maybe you could help. I strongly encourage you to take a chance, but if I don't soon your needs at this time, thank you for your participation. and a little bit of a little bit.

My turst puffed pro style would make low limb chant movies. Somewhere somehow, a great fine told me that you're starting a magazine called the World Review. That's a sad fine, also let me know that the staff will be small, which means you're not hiring to any. He ain't low man on the totem pole is fine with me. Your magazine sounds original, smart, and progressive. It's sophisticated but not shallow. Of course I'm just guessing. You go global to tell me, I think so. Should you? I think not. Or a soapbox.

Here at him, I can move my guard desk when I write. But wonder a straight-up, ask with my letter, speaking with, I didn't hear. You see, how can I overthink the coding move? Let's say something starts with things. What about S? And then I... by him, the media feeds. Also, what if I'm just on the rebound from the E? Not that I didn't you before, maybe I'm just too the same, but I might be exaggerating it because I'm feeling a loss. Maybe we're confusing a really good friendship, they love, etc.  that we are. Also, let's say you do have sex, it will be a bigger deal for you. Not that I want to take seriously. I have seriously thought about, but it's a big responsibility to put on me. your place to eat. So, now who's babble? Anyway, I think you're a wonderful person in friend, and the last thing I want to do is screw that up. Maybe we should just see, so I'll run, if making out easier this. You never know, we might decide it doesn't feel right, if you can't stand as work, but we might end up getting it on every day. It's used the vulgar language as a guy in English class would say there is no pretty way to accept. Anyway, I love you, but I'm not sure what kind of you love me. Geez, I don't even know what attracted me to you. You so fucking put this. Stop the mental attack, stop the mental attack. Well, things be the same once the sexual tension is in. I think that's half the fine. It's what is kept moonlighting on the air. Will we still be able to joke about getting married at set for without peering uncomfortable? Confusion. There are an ass-in-pardoning. I'm even mixed up about that. You went out after that, sir. Yes, sir. You can't be the same. I'm just going to ask you a question. You're going to ask me a question. I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to ask you a question. You can't be the same. Check it out. I read this letter a little while and I make a little reading. It's a handwriting, it's from a friend of mine. You wrote to me and asked me to say, it used them. 7 or 8. Follow them. Let me go for it. It was during the dog boy, the first dog boy. pushes from him. This guy in Morocco, and he was in the 68 student level in France. He got actually in the seat team. And the stationaries from Botel, we got there. Where he actually wasn't staying in Botel. Here Jeff, it's a joke. Today I went to the concert again. the world. Many people thanks to Bush Hussein, Litter Hong and so all your chaps went out from their quiet routines and we met again speaking and debating  when the sun was. Many young people here. Many people here know the fact that the voice of the TV is a weapon against their liberty. Since the war is central point at the universe of the country, the great lie of democracy is becoming enemies. Liber, the United States, the democracy is the victory, the left is right, everything is true as well as its country. Anyway, I have bought a house and old war in a new evil village in the mouth at 5km steps. many things to repair. So I am a dirty owner, one to be hungry. I enjoy very much to make up the arrangements for house out referring to him. I need a dress. I do not know if I shall go to the USU, maybe so, maybe more. This is my first time from Morocco to pay this over, book. I saw a sign of the song. Did it all? Of my own. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. It was a love note. I'm a girl. And I was so full. I was so happy. And that is... The leather. It said, not darling, I've read it so long ago. Extraordinary feelings. I have a full life of the virus. I'm not a real person. I've made several of my friends. All the ones I love and very clearly, but that's not how it feels to be the song. I love you. I will run on you.

Let her. She told me mommy's mommy's a lady. She's probably a baby and a big no one. And she read love. I saw the little happy with my ears. I did for you. Did I read love? How would you have it? situation worse, thankfully. Bally the loans! H availability! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it! This is a very, very proud friend of mine. This given, this is the start to see the smile. They can't really feel it. That's not the problem. They can't show it to the sliders. This is Christmas. That is, of course, I'm not in your life. And she only had to wait to see the sliders. She can't see the little thing. The better begins. How, how, how, these are the words I know you're describing. That's why. All right, this is the letter that I received. Now, it's a dress to me, so I'm on the envelope, it says, lessons for advanced beginners and then back it says, learn after you read it. Dear mesmas. I can imagine how easy it must be to discover what art is all about, and then use your fast-hyl capacity to steer symbols, ideas, quotes, etc. In combined them in an automatic, large-type structure making the work seem as steep as you can. It is very convenient to read. Poles to meet up. I almost fell off my chair when during my retreats, you implied that you are, quote, a really good artist. After sitting there listening to your chant, mama mama mama mama mama, which you got from young offspring. I shopped paper bands at 6 days too. Then hearing your chant, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me. I sat there wondering, just how conventionous and pretentious chick dressed in black and deep. I, by the way, used chick  this since you were not very young. In fact, you are nothing but a contrived self-deceiving selfish, not overly bright, mediocre. You might be able to fool the pozers who hang around or this orbit splatter me brother to come to know. But not me, babe. Not me, babe. I used babe lightly. You are not a babe. You have no sensuality, no charm, no looks, without an affectation, without deliberately taking. steps to appear avant, where would you be? Nothing comes naturally to you, this. You really have to steal and growl and neighbor. In fact, you are a person who is a misleder from material right now, I bet. I realized how repressed and affected you are during user's alias. And thank God for the fire which started or you probably still be on the floor, reciting your brothers' fault. You are just too too uptight baby. you can act on a niddy. But why do you want to? Is it that important to you that you soon to yourself and others as a pure special? You are quite interesting. The only person with absolutely no substance I've ever met. How did you get so f***? Give up art, you're no good at it anyway, and save your f***ing ass. Since you're the Mason 32 degrees, he has well, I've been always been made moody at this moment. Janik really had person has profound hospital illness. Somebody who is really turned on, oh what? Coming up more letters from everyday, keep a minute. This is American Life in my Replace. This is a program we bring you stories by writers and about the history of trying a little radio experiment where I gave it a hop-channel and I have advertised 20 people who are great intimate students, Taga, probably a brand newbie, five, and then here. And we're moving by to bring letters once they're got them, these are the same things and found read on stage... So, this is kind of street. It's not really street. It's not really street. It's not really street. This guy, this is kind of street. He's writing to school. He's reading the computer. He's not mentioning to the phone. He's constantly asking the phone to hear that problem. He's reading the phone. He's constantly asking the phone to hear that problem. Thank you. that was I'm sorry about me. And Emma's gotten me. There's this guy seen across the world between something as his left ear pushed men and men pounds and trying to count to our unspive metal wheels going to his ear. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be too out of this looking yet. It looks  five or six, so please, all up and down zero. He uses the ring to see one's knees across three vessels. Then there's one guy, starting, I don't think I ever been in this bus when he wasn't here , but he didn't stop in for me. Same thing for the side of the road. KGD slut, father, shoes always here too. Shooters are mostly times I mean too. Okay, some girl just came in, who was wearing where a sense of the spoon  a rug or a piece of carpet with some poles cutting. She's going on. Who else is always in this class? Hmm, I just realized that probably shouldn't talk about KGD structure or from Shepra's feet or shoes or later or something. I think here's what she needs me to do to be so happy with something. Oh yeah, we are dead with you here. And she has just got dead. She's talking whileawaking. screens, yeah definitely looks  correct. Max, you yourself, West, you have five colors, and it's got little blood screen things inside you. It does kind of get a towel. Just a few short minutes ago, I walked over to faculty dining in the table. There's a physics department, Bob, you suppose to don't know. I wasn't sure if I should go. I mean it's free food and that can be hard to test up. Plus, to build Bob, it's free to be free to be real food for people. What's your dinner? My favorite. food. I was extremely disheartened by what I saw. That's what these people call body. Here's my image of what about a bunch of people outside standing or sitting around. Beers and people talking from the one above. The sizzle of meat on the grill and the sweet small cooking piece filled me up and everyone was happy with jallion, nice and so much to be able to do. The problem is that the dollar of everyday life, the reminder of a sort of great purpose in for... be ours working and yet problems change naturally. Minds that purpose. But in many ways is that purpose. For problems change is one of the great finding elements of the universe. That sort of metaphysical play, though, that maybe can be shaken old if it not can find. And seeing where I come from, you can understand my shock and horror as what I saw being called problems in this evening, back at home. Why did not stay for a while? No. In the scan. In the scan, few seconds that I did venture into the food, what I did all those things I  to give that I go. and scared me lightly and I did not care for Seymour. So this information I bring you now is not just likely not even to think, not a full of power in the Barbeard version for the first week. I saw them to see me at the men's service, which is organized in the regular order and test. These people, we're not traversing amongst themselves, not in the not understanding the sweet bliss that is too far to see. There was a speaker, yes a speaker, at a podium, and the assembled masses applaud me, not understanding that it is not all the sweet stuff. and lightning-parts piece. Upon, there's not problems just purpose to nine-parts in this time, man is a back-signed mob. But the problem is he doesn't hear me in lightning, he's meters in more antelodic means. And there were wagers in waitresses, lonely rooms serving food. So together, Lord, did not understand problem of the knowledge of the barbecue. At this site, I've fled, but I had seen a few of those. And they're mere present, was the mere real problem. My message, not one. of the case of the condemnation, but rather one of the information once he can create awareness what's in Bob's ways and it's virtually bound this past world with his creatings. I'll be most of the immaterial of a whole good nature. It is my heart called the Future Bob's who is willing to use recognizes past world, we consider the way the Future Bob's future looks they are achieve. For Bob's who provides a life, a beauty in a good, man-time, and without proper respect for and methods up for Bob's future, this knock girl! Now it will be lost in the future if mankind will be lost in the future. God bless you and God bless Bob too. Big Tenism, the letter says, when it's cut, the wide he's side with. Well, that letter was a good example, actually. I used to host a lot of spoken words that now when he will read his hands. I found the events that didn't predict the board by our writing piece. I think when people write just themselves, it's the one of the person that they're not looking over the shoulder at literary conventions, , we're the editors, you say, they're not worried about the content, but how does it do they do that much fear with their expression, both stylistically and what they're willing to talk about? For example, poverty, you, says we're poverty, you'll write about barbecuing, if it's a email. It's the point of... You're probably most likely you won't read that one. Probably not read that one better part. But what? And yeah, I just read there a very unpredictable. Give me two of this. Yeah, that's more wrong. Which is more, it really when I need to finish getting inside people's hands and really  the letters. This is my personal. I just want to do something sub-cut. See how they really are. I'm gonna get it. Now, what are you gonna do? Well, I'll next read it. Susan? Susan? Susan? Susan? He's our... Of course, I'm using the narrative. It's exactly. There's a poem in it, too, wrong. The theme. Sparky. All the words of the thank yous could never convey the depth and scope of the remote of the gratitude for you. Maybe forever uncover unfold a love occasion or joy and laugh our way through the spread of my love. And that was written September 12, 1992. And the next letter is written Spark on December 24, 1993. Dear Nadine, I love you. I love you very very. much. This Christmas has brought me many gifts that I never knew existed before. I am learning about humility, patience, and trust, and most of all I am learning about unconditional love. This year I can't give you the material Christmas that I'd  to that you deserve. I can't even give you the card I bought for you because I lost it. Instead, I can give you some others. up now and see materials jump will. First one, good for one really good body such. Second one, good for one really good putt massage. The both two items may be redeemed anytime and not really gifts because you can have those anytime one.
