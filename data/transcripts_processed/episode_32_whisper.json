Last, each week in our program of course, we choose a theme. And as we remember, writers have had a theme, and this week we bring you a look at the Republican Party and its convention. So that is not it, you can say more. Hack 1, everyday life. with the convention, what do those people actually do all day long? Act 2, a Walter Mondale voting, gay rights, boarding, and liberal. Signs up to the Republican Party member and ends up a delegate to the convention. Act 3, we have the newest installment of Michael Ruse's teen diaries.

And so we had peace be. which is going to be fine by pro-tri-smotorics and co-owned Susan Longman. In addition to all that, the leadership told right-wing advocates National Rifle Association, right-wing weapon stations, but they would not be about to set up foods inside the convention hall.

My father's switch, , as a Republican, I was the President. My father was the National Chairman of the Irish Democratic Committee for year. Now, he's dead now, and I know he voted for Reagan before he died. It used to be that the Irish Catholicism, particularly, but Irish American period, or far more democratic. Now, the most recent poll is 47% of Irish. Americans say they're going to vote in the product 43% that are going to vote in common. So that's good. It's a sign of the changes in American politics and the vitality of the public and party. That many of the people who need to add the convention switch over from Democratic and Western schools. But we're both in navigation. We've had the gun owners of America and arrived from national rightful assistance. Even if you're still reporters, it's funny why they're not supporting the country to make the seat in the state inside. I know right now. But the ticket right now is going to go down unless they bring gunners and you fall. I mean, organized gunners in the country is bigger than the Jewish boat. It's bigger than a lot of other dudes around. At some point during the Slares, someone introduced me to Russian, Chuck Boyz. He's retired in the festival at Ponyxon, here running in the city, and then practically he's going to decide something to do. For 10 years ago, he was a good man. Now he stands among the public and stands for Athens. Going red wedding date, please. He spent his time of convention in Semnas. And the go-top, that's a little bit of a question. And the Seminars are on how to be in effect candidate in the last two months. And the fundraiser, the manager, time, people in the last two months, had a respond to the Democratic Party propaganda that Medicare and that had reached the gender gap. One of the pieces of advice was that Republicans tend to do very well in terms of talking about strategy and economy. concepts and principles and data. And when you talk to a woman, she is more rather than she's more qualitative, rather than quantitative. And she wants to hear things about what you will do or what the party will do or what the platform is that relates to her everyday life. So you have to do it more anecdotal and more related to everybody's life. It really makes a lot of sense. But don't think that. that one of the reasons why this gender gap isn't because of the way the Republicans talk about the issues, because on the specific issues, women as a group don't tend to agree as often with the Republican position. To some degree, maybe  I might be asking a couple of two or three percent. Check why so I was never run from the public office for this and talking to it, you can talk. He's so much more emotionally present than any normal political candidate in a new future in the eye. asking questions, you actually answered the question. And he has none of that robotic not quite human hot people after that that It's I retired the tenure to Christ's ship to run for up so I could have been secure in academia All right The pieces why are you doing I love my country Well, I come from a really humble background and my country as well. It has given me dynamite B rocket I opportunity that all I have to do is think of manager. I'm the son of a whole minor. Are you somebody who's always wanted to run Prophecy Village to write within the backing line? No. When did the idea come into your head? Well, I had a family meeting. My daughter in this son, their girl, college educated off on their own. My wife and I got together. And I just, my kid, I just, I look  I might want to take an early retirement. And so my, and God says why don't you run for office? I see him. that it'd be kidding. I said,  what is involved with running for office, , the mudslowing and the long hours, then all of a sudden I got it,  what the, this is, this is the permanent mine. He says, this is our pointy, we love it. Yes, not you, we're doing it. But we're doing it and that's when you decided, we're spending 60,000 dollars per hour. You are. And  many people I met it. What was most striking about Chuck Boyce saw was the sightings. The scene completely ceasing. We talked for a while and later as I was climbing off the boat, past and as the boat I was talking to. But what's important over here is time to say sorry about his daughter. The same words. The same fact about time. You all know that I believe in a woman's right to choose and I strongly support the firm of action. I was invited. And I was in the United, I think I'm already sad in the convention problem, which never happened to be watching. You could clearly hear a mixed blues and cheers that joke out. It is big plea for inclusiveness and conflict. It is unclear how inclusive a really realist world wants to be. One persistent and widespread rumor all week long, except gay. a republic for the Aspera Block, Tolerance, for the organization of the Lugat. And at party-todom, no hotel room seems to be available in San Diego or in the surrounding counties and booked in rooms over the border until on. That is the only acceptable place for actually outsized the borders of the United States in America. This cannot be false, not true at all. The parties attitude that included the centers, the so-called youth. that every time it was said, it had the sound of something that actually might be true. I made way, everybody knew that inclusion was the word of the way everyone's community. Even if you were urging people not to do that, you did it in language inclusion, goodness of said it. Happy canon, Texas delegation breakfast, give you the setting here. Okay, picture and news reset, descending in front of its 25th hallboy, made entirely red and... back and do the things. Man, close your eyes up. It's all being tolerant and close. Now, let me say this. You do want an inclusive party abroad party. Think back over the last one years. When will we at our most broadest close? In 1984, we stood up and said, no pale past girls, party can't be all things open. Here's where we stand. And here's what we believe. We are conservative part. We are strong on the dance strong on life. What's it mean to you? Yes, we're certainly. These questions even extended to the dance points in the album. Early in the week, one of the conservative magazines published in the special convention issue, an article that questions the kinds of music, later, public and studies. It is of course a moral pop music that does not mean to be a language. Some of it by musicians  Village People. the live style, the Republican delegates do not prove up. Well, when they night, the Iowa delegation ended up in Bar, called the Dix, last resort, this is the place with bras, strung up over the guard,  spoils, dors, big gains for it. And when ACDC picked onto the San Francisco, a sensible Republican delegate named Rory Weepong, an essential skirt, senseless shoes, senseless haircut, why couldn't these officers at home? wearing a young sticker that's it, life of the party, life and big red red lipstick. Many of the right to life delegates were, they were, she jumped onto the stage, executed what I have to say is the most incredible display of arrogant artwork I have seen in my life. Literally people were cheering, she hurled herself to her knees and power cords, and she just generally rocked out. When I walked up to her afterwards, the contemporary quarter and asked me to shoot from, she replied very quickly, friends. But, I'm gonna be a demon. I get fall. This is just a band that drove all the way out here. My little red convertible is popped down all the way. Everyone in Reno and Continental divide. It's great. It's a country that's just beautiful and wonderful. And I know, we all know how to compare and do on their best to help people wonder more and more and more. Even if that's kind of music for most family values. Oh. Probably not, I guess. I guess I'll get really excited about a lot of them. I mean if I said, we do a different amount of things. I don't want to get scared. I mean I wouldn't morally ground it. I mean, alright, yes, I have a nice feet, I can dance through it, but I don't necessarily believe everything that it might prove. ? In a sense, this is a nice statement of how many Republicans we have. That many issues. morally grounded enough inside themselves with it. And not caring. But the fellow Republicans think about it. Unless it's unreasonable. I mean, I think I'll be able to do this. Let me go. Some in past me, inclusiveness and fun. Not to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna let you in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come with me, too. Send me a go. Yeah. He will find our kind of youth. Yeah. I am the Republican Pre-Sit Committee Officer, PCO, for a precinct 1846 in the 43rd district in Seattle, If you have any questions about the Republican Party or platform for any of our candidates, feel free to give me a call. Now, should Quynet here that Dan Savage is not just a Republican precinct from the officer. He's also a gay sex commons, a drag game, and some of them will agree with none of the principles of the Republican Party. Now, you're probably wondering how a common pinko drag bag sex advice columnists found a home in the hate-mongering gay-bash and neo-fascist Republican Party. Let me tell you something, pal. The Republican Party is big. 10. The huge 10. Don't know, I'd Elijah Littonists tests in Republican Party caucuses or conventions that I attended . I didn't have to produce a voter registration reporter a picture ID even to my very first caucus. A measure, I believe in the respect the Republican party has for the rights of the individual. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line, Dan Savage, certified some D sheet considers himself herself in Republican and that was it. Who knew I'm going over to the dark side to be so simple? Okay, here's the story. Back on Papua. here. This posting first and second question was really Republican primary system. The answer of it's got it in just head that the only way to change a political party that Natalie disagreed with, but also hated and feared was to sign up and change it from the inside. So he showed up at his local Republican caucus which in the 43rd is a small group of Republican members in the big Green memberhood. And at this point his story took pressingucken. Once he arrived he found out that because he was the only person from a little precinct that he was in which caucuses ran into the non-eutiful precinct. He was that he was automatically made, precinct community officer, and then automatically want to see at the county with the public intervention. We wrote up the experience that he had at the caucus, the innermost damning, partisan term, humanly possible, and published it in the meeting. But, is it done? a couple of weeks after I traveled over to the dark side, Daniel made Smith chairman of the 40-perfect public and party wrote me a letter. I think you'll be surprised that the eight-mongering gay bashing Neo-Fascist Republican Party does not exist in the 43rd Smith route. I invite you to come to one of our meetings and see for yourself. So I went to one of Smith's meetings to see for myself and 43rd district Republican I arrived at the Montenegro Community Center from 1996, Forty-Fair District and Public Encoccasers in 8am. I paid my $5 signed in, grabbed a seat, and waited for the work to begin. We were there to elect delegates to the State Republican Convention coming up Memorial Day weekend, and vote on non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with a prayer we asked God to guide us in selecting delegates, and then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. The only trouble was no one brought a flag. The party may be safer. of agents to the bag, hey that's me, but I didn't want to be described now. Someone found some red white and blue bunting in the back room, posted over an easel and we pledged the agents to that. The easel was needed post-clad, so the red white and blue bunting to which we had just pledged our agents just passed on the floor. We had to elect delegates before we could get the resolutions, I won't bore you with the Robert Mool's vort Theatre program. often being positive in the country and the process, in which the 80 of us in that cramped, steeple roof fluorescent that room elected 17 delegates to the state were coming from the commision. Suffice to say it was crushingly dull. To entertain us while we waited in the balance to be counted four times, Republican Party acted as some candidates gave with the speeches. Some of these speeches were a pure fantasy. One woman read a prepared speech about the United Nations working in concert with abortionists to take the other recurring fantasy had to do with us, 43rd death. Republicans, retaking the 43rd Republican Party. One man reminisced about the time not too long ago, when the 40th is a solidly Republican district. We can make this district Republican again just  it was when I joined the party 25 years ago. All we have to do is get out there and doorbell and identify the voters in this district where sympathetic to our issues. Heart pounding is stuck on the mirror. And any of you have been out of the house and walked down Broadway and lasted 25 years or, I asked him. looking around at the top of Sprout Act from the Everglade. The 40-fer district I pointed out had gone all gay all of this sudden. So long as the Republican Party was identified with homophilics and anti-gave-bigged activists, the Republican Party could kiss the 43rd district goodbye. When I sat down a little low ladies sitting behind me pointed out that she knew very many snakeheads in the middle of the minority. In other words, she and by extension the party was not homophobic and I say a step forward and this whole time the race is set as. Particularly Jeff Muzeur gave her some of the projects whichoded with anti-gave-been as she and by Ishikawa. Skelling video Switching to Oz constituency. I have been thinking that個人opole cults haveained thanks for this helpful post at Curse Ct Kinoshita. If you are interested, gost projectors will subscribe our YouTube show. He said to me, the party isn't against gay people, that's just a false impression. G, I wonder where I could have picked up that false impression. Maybe from Jesse Helms, from Dornin' Bob, $1,000 in goal, anti-gay rights rallies and Iowa during primarys attended by all Republican presidential hopefuls, even moderate in Mario and Zander. Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, New Gagers, Ludesmith, and Crosswells, Bob Cancounty Corner, Dexter, Emin, Washington State Legislature, State Legislature, the State Legislature, was essentially successful on Thanksgiving. During a break, an attractive middle-aged man approached me. He was a little angry. I was offended by you forcing me to take responsibility for Jesse Helms. Is solution going to be nobody? What can party isn't responsible for just some moments. One woman wanted to know why she should support gay people, so some gay people didn't support her when her home was burned down by our services. The arsonists weren't gay or anything, but where were gay people when she needed? Another pointed out that some gays had broken the windows of the Republican Party headquarters, so who's a pressing boog? Another man took me aside during break to let me know that the gay bashing within the Republican Party wasn't for real. It was only to get out the vote and motivate the front lines. Well then I guess that makes you okay. I'm happy to be vilified and scapegoated and denied my civil rights, so long as it motivates people to go to the polls. This in French, Highsmen is a small price to pay to the police for their attention. To a surprise at this meeting, Dan Savage talked the caucus into approving a resolution that affirmed the rights of gazing as bands. And rejected elements of the party who would exploit fear and hatred of homosexuals for the end. He could not wait after this victory to get to the counter-contention. As an official delegate, Dan Savage would be able to vote there to the enlightenment amendments to really the right to play a role. He planned about in the straw polls that have a decent, for the most conservative Republican candidates in this case, happy kind of president and for the governor of Washington State who has been brought to Elm Praswell, who poses gun control and gay rights, moral decay, and who he votes. It's ever just thinking is that, the more extreme. with Republican ticket that ended up being. The more likely they would lose in general election. And the more likely that the party would eventually abandon this more conservative wing. A few weeks later, the big day arrived. The King County Republican Convention. My first major party function. Hats, speeches, and amendments. I founded out a bed at 7am. Ran to meet my new friend Steve at the QFC on Broadway. Steve attended his precinct cocks his way back in March and the intention of getting into. in a delegate in county and state and from conventions. me, he joined the Republican Party out of the sincere desire to move the GOP to the center. Kindred spirits we decided to attend the county convention together. The doors opened at 7.30am. After the crowd settled down a preacher read an alarming opening location which pretty much sat in town from what was to come. Please forgive me. our leaders for endorsing perversion and God deliver us from Spineless Compromise. Then we bellowed in Pledge of Allegiance to the Black of the United States of America. I slipped up to the merchandise tables in the second floor where I bought myself in red, white and blue, cross-well for governor and I. It must have been faked, in my way back down from the merchandise tables. I ran smack dab into Ellen, cross-well, who snowed. I said hello and looking very serious in my little red-white and black ass, what are we going to do about the homosexuality? problems for us as well. What is the final solution on this homosexual nonsense? So long as they stay inside, we can let them alone while in class open-minded in me. When they organize in demand special rights, we must oppose them. We can't give special rights to something that is in a bombination and eyes of God. Now Ellen didn't seem interested in elaborating on just what it is we're supposed to stay inside. The closet, apartments, and priesthood. So I said goodbye, promising to vote for her primary. You see the better Ellen does in the primary, the better the Democratic candidate for Governor will do in the fall. I made it back to the convention floor just in time for the opening of debate on the party platform. The King County Republican platform is a document run up by a committee that lays out what the King County Republican party stands for. And here's the beautiful part. The delegates allowed to propose men. Once an amendment is composed, the amendment sponsor is allowed to speak, followed by a few people in favor, a few opposed, after that the sponsor gets another minute or so to address the floor. I was a delegate, I had amendments, and so I would get to address the convention, over and over and over again. And as amendments are time consuming, determined delegates can grind the convention to a home. The first section we were to vote on was the preamble in which we acknowledge God. our creator and the family is the foundation of our culture. We embraced free markets, recognized that tax and regulatory burdens are a threat to our freedoms, not a yanyana. Before we could vote on the preamble and it hadn't occurred to me to amend the preamble, to delegate the pose that align the added. The stating that the party was open to all who accept its basic principles, regardless of race, religion, sex, or national origin. After debate, the first resolution of the day passed by a distressing narrow emerging. Race, Creed, Sex, National Origin, something was missing. Steven approached the microphone and proposed that the just past amendment also be amended to include the word section on the nation. Well, Steve's amendment was soundly defeated by a voiceboat that no untabulated sounded to me  1,589 to 11. Then the liberty section was up for me. I dashed to a microphone during my own household hat and proposed this amendment. As respect and rights of the individual,  a bedrock of Republican values, the King County Republican Party, hereby recognizes the fundamental human rights of gay and lesbian American citizens. You reject elements on the fringe of the Republican Party that would exploit fear and hatred of gay and lesbian American citizens, for short-term, poor and poor and gay. Through the shouting I pointed out that we... King County Republicans can't have it both ways. We can't say in one breath that we oppose discrimination, with our next breath support discrimination against gay and lesbian American citizens. So let's vote on it. Do we, the Republicans of King County, recognize the fundamental rights of gay and lesbian Americans citizens, or do we not? Well, we do not. After some heated debate, the names I was called, perfect, sign of my, damn it, my amendment was voted down. After my amendment failed, the woman in a class will have approached me. Why? wearing that hat she grisely implied because I'm from Craswell.  where she stands on gay things, don't you? Having recently had a conversation with Ellen herself, I'm lo certainly did. But I'm not, I smile on the important my new friend and fellow Craswell supporter of Singelish Uvonger. Try to imagine now that you are a homophobic Republican jerk. which might be a triple redundancy at your county convention. You came for the speeches, Nantai Klit and T-shirt, New Collection, and a hot non. This is what you do for fun, Woohoo. But these three guys keep introducing pro gay rights amendments, moving to have anti-gay amendments struck and generally messing with their afternoon. You didn't come to the convention to defend your party's homophobia, and you certainly didn't come expecting to listen to gay men giving speeches all day long. Woohoo are these guys, and why is that one wearing a crossbow hat? Okay, you're this person, what do you do? You get man, very, very man. One delegate decided to get even. In what can only be described as a dated lynched moment, a pausing deliant staggered up with a microphone and proposed to change in the rules. No further discussion of homosexuality allowed, his resolution needed to two thirds majority of you pass because it was a rules change, not a simple moment. Pass it, didn't, to hoots and powers and cheers. But we had yet to vote on the Education section which contained a pint about the homosexuality. When we got to education, all hell broke loose. Roberts' rules of order fetishists led to their feed insisting that the anti-gay pint in the education section would have to be struck. If we can't discuss homosexuality, we can't vote on it. The voting is a discussion. -oh, we were talking about homosexuality again. People were booing, shouting, all the humanity. The chair bringing the room to work. a calmly ruled that the no-forger discussion resolution applied only to pro-game discussions. We could discuss homosexuality, but only if we weren't saying anything nice and learned. And the convention limped to a planet, most of the day having been wasted debating gay rights, gay marriage, what makes people gay and my hand. I learned. Here's what I learned about with publicans that we can. They don't  homos very much. They certainly don't  having to talk about us, and they certainly  listening to us even less. But they do  beating up on us in their platforms. So King County Republicans, I'll make you a deal. Leave us out of your platform in 98 in the next convention cycle, and I'll stay away from your convention. But if we're in the platform, I intend to return. The Ancestral Dacinicated Sex Advice column called Savage Love, who's writer and editor at a weekly Seattle newspaper called The Stranger. Coming up, Michael Lewis and more unusual stories of Republican Party politics. That's in a minute. When I program, he can use. It's American life. I'm a red glass. It's written up in a program of course, which is in the name. being with the writer, writers and stories and storytelling styles. I'll program today. It's about the Republican Convention Act 3 campaign diaries. Throughout this year, we've been bringing you the reportage of Michael Lewis. He's publishing his campaign diaries in the new report. And I say this pretty much every time we have him on the show. He's writing about corners of the election process that nobody else is. He just had this. I also play the telling with going a little moment and detail. Regular listeners to a program or regular readers, please know that at some point during this election year, Michael Lewis became mesmerized with a presidential candidate by the name of Mori Taylor. Mori Taylor ran into the Republican primaries. He shows up in this installment of our year. He is out spoken and he is the founder and CEO of Titan Tyrant Heal and he goes by the nickname, The Grids. These campaign diaries meant for us not in the Tindu-Din public mention convention, he also flew to Recipes of Pundits, top-dose boys and homies. August 7th I don't really expect anyone to answer the door of Bob Bowles, House and Russell Kansas, but I stop by anyway just to see what might happen. When you travel with Doll, you see the world as it is constructed by the Doll of the In-thing. Until you almost forget, there is a world outside it, where people do the unexpected. And V has our reach for the screen. door I have wondered if some squat being will leave out of the bushes and home you back and bob dolls can contain quiet citizenship for questions. The doll is a few days behind me and the neighborhood remains undisturbed by holidays. The only sign that I'm in the right place is a faded paint mat beneath my feet. Welcome to the home of the dolls. It reads, after a single ring, front door swings open and an elderly woman steps outside. Just clean it up before Bob gets here, she says. It's Bob Dull's sister, Gloria, and she's a matter of fact as Dull himself. She then disappears inside, leaving the door open for me to follow. I did. Bob Dull's boyhood home is official residency fair. It's instantly recognizable to anyone who had grandparents in the 1960s. No. 1960s old person's furniture, low-backed lounge chairs, 1960s old person colors, a natural shades of green. In 1960s old person smells 1940s perfume. Over the roar of the 1960s vacuum cleaner, Gloria opened various doors and tosses on the various powers items for me to inspect. The doors contain hundreds of loose photographs of dull music. That neither Gloria nor anyone else has looked at in the years. One shot depicts dull modeling clothes in a fashion show, staged by a local department's store, another shows in shirtless with his muscles slightly flat. As a collection, they capture both dolls' natural obedience, he always poses us, and his intense physical vanity. How many 18-year-olds in 1940 lifted weights? He looks  a movie star, I say, a gorilla. He wasn't movie star, she says quickly. the movie star. The whole thing happened so fast as Seize Only Natural that I'm ransacking the home where the Republican presidential nominee. After a thorough search for the premises we move on to the garage, passing the side-dolls bed, a strange pair of little black sandbow rag belts, the sort they don't even allow in the South and me. The inside of the garage is a welcome of ancient possessions that long-sense. to serve any useful purpose. 5 pound cameras, medicine balls, that's what I'm doing. The outside of equally on the mark, says the jury rig system of sausage shake weights, the dull use to rebuild is on after the war. According to glory, the captain is simply hung out at the past 50 years. Unpouching by time or fate. Though the flies have me the way. As I watched the white rope school for the eye of the silver pulley, I realized I am also watching Bob Dull's campaign in microcosm. Somewhere in America, Dull would be the getting a speech of preparing to get a speech, in which he invokes the place where I now stand and the things he once did here. Now let's just take Bob Dull, they'll say, and nothing special about me, roughness small town. Dad wears overalls, work every day, 42 years. It was proud of him. Grup in a base in the park. Six of us. They make ends meet. And Russell, Kansas. Didn't have any money. But we had lots of bags. Then he will allude arcically. Two is whirling in the roller recovery pump. The insistence on the importance of events would have occurred. 50 years ago, in a place where he hasn't lived for 35 years, is more than a little strange. It's as if Dould has made a bargain with himself, when with those who were judging, which enables him to cease all serious self-examination after the age of 25. The deal is something  this. Dould agrees to believe that it was worth it to have his arm and his vanity shattered from the sake of his country. In return, the country agrees not to question what lurks inside you. to a single decision he made 15 years ago is forever the war hero. It's a strangely standard view, 73 years on planet. And the planet. And the planet. And the planet. And the planet. And the planet. And the planet. Mori Taylor asked me to meet him in the parking lot by the San Diego Convention Center. But the Convention Center is closed, and the police is surrounded, have no idea where to find the parking lot. And after a half hour search, I asked him. top and be seen 5,000 people in Hollywood games and motorcycles. The number more it promised to deliver to the adult man. The police officer looks at me as if I am man. How many? F.S. incredulously? 5,000, you say? There is no way you get 5,000 motorcycles anywhere near. For the first time since I met him seven months ago, I doubt more visibility before our part. How do you find? 5000 bikeers anyway. Soon enough I find the parking lot. It lies directly behind a small cluster of protesters. Half mile or so from the conventions. It consists of maybe four acres of concrete back in which is a stage. Over the stage is an American flag and front of the flag is a few fans. It reads. Hi, America's newest pirate. That's Maurice. On the stage, a five-large black-flying loudest, teacher poonger is a vain danna that says, The grids, that's more. At the front of the stage, with a cigar-jettling straight out from his mouth, Jai-Riddy, slightly to the fog, is more. The roar of a coaching motorcycle soon grounds out everything. Not 5,000, but 7,000 motorcycles are streaming across the bridge. They are ridden by 7,000 republicans, and led by Happy United States Congress in various local bigings. Newt Engage in Trent Lot, then Nighthorse Camp on Dick Armour. But from the moment the bikers arrive at the gates, the goal campaign ensures that pretty much everything goes wrong. The goal is promised to attend, causes a police. to keep 68-100 biker down on the highway, letting the men look too much of the security of this, they say. The thick line beautifully comes to a halt from the biker's weight, restlessness. The dull can't think goes back and forth until everyone involved is thoroughly unhappened. Now or so later, the dull can't paint finally it, and it's the dull won't be coming. The effect is immediate. The senators and congressman is the politicians exit out of that gate. The 3,000 or so bikers who were made on the highway enter through the front. More claims that most of the bikers are actually doctors and lawyers, but these are doctors and lawyers with wild big bellies and long facial pair. To a man they are covered in patches that identify them as ardent champion in the American way. They are most popular cause by far as they will be in a more. Everyone is either a veteran or a friend of a veteran. by choice, coming by injection, reads a tip of farm ban. The event quickly degenerates into an enjoyable experience. The Glee or Maurice face is the bikers, who's already calling him midebikers, roaring to the lot, calls to mind a small child on Christmas morning. The bikers for their part seem frill, especially when more immune walks across the stage. The girls grids t-shirts into the rock as crap. As he does, the band strikes up the new song. It's your thing. Do what we gotta do. I can't tell you. What not? Five hours later I sit behind, all in North Spam, we watch him happy and take the stage at a rally in Nespa and Bita. He can't afford to remain inside the Republican Party. That much we know. The band's copies of the speech distributed by his staff. We don't. that was having as far away from the takement. One moment at the start of the ceremony speaks volumes about what you can in the following the ruptment, as opposed to what you can in claims he's up in. After the pledge of allegiance, a plaque at the back of the room acts on a polyph appendice, born and unborn and shout, when I express astonishment that they have dared to amend the pledge of allegiance. Fellow Germans, give me a word you've been, look. You're experienced. they've also rewritten the star-spangled Banner to incorporate some co-life language. Nothing illustrates so well how anti-conservant you can as movement truly is. Its goal is not to conserve the past, but to advance the rattle of gender. The constant invocation of the past, the founding fathers, the declaration, etc. is more of a smoke-screen in the house. The feminist will be difficult to be out these people to know fashion and serve the cause the dog man. It's  trying to transform a white info in the usable car. That's still a real problem. Pemper mentally, he's a conservative. Every fiber in his body can't run in any kind of reaction from ever again changing his lines. Pylate afternoon, I finally find Moriang and wandering the convention floor. He looks surprised never anyone recognized him. One thought. television crew even stopped the interview. Mr. Taylor in a work, he even with his Mr. Taylor asking me, Marie said the reporter uncertainly, the grids boom, Marie. I tell him it's just a few hours earlier and then named Ed Harrison took the podium and started his speech with the immortal words. Now I'm not a politician and I'm not a lawyer. I'm a businessman. He'd stolen Marie's precise words. This two worried people quite believe. He hasn't entirely grasped the power of the modern meat. I have decided it's finally turned to lead him, and I'm wondering how to break the news. The terror campaign has come to an end, at least for the moment. I have forgotten the general rule of American politics. If you hang with more Hitler, the action will follow. The rule continues to happen. We're sitting in the section reserved for the primary planet that's been tapped to be cannon appears from the first time on the convention floor. He's already got, maybe, 50 journals with him who quickly accumulates another 100, plus several hundred delegates keen to shake his hand. The result is a human tsunami that breaks across about a third of the convention hall lays waste to anything that's packed. People are being trampled, and enormous security guards shouting to his wrist mic. ام me 50. People, the crowd at the convention has its own logic, however. People merely attract more people. For every added security man, free curiosity seekers join in. So as we can in circles, the hall, the tension rises. He's  a ball of varying in a roulette wheel behind the sideways saddle. At length, he comes to rest in the seat directly behind the line. For the one third of the convention, ignoring George W. Bush to speak. Highestly from the podium. Open up the child, bear here, center, your church, or synagogue. That's me. I need more help here. Where's the garden who is risked? Send help. Send help. Then you can and notice his more. More trailers, the problem here. He shouts, mockingly. He's ruined the convention. Do they do this to you when you got here, mori? Shouts, baby, can, and joining her brother and ganging up on mori. It seems, baby. listening to the crew. Maurice stands alone, watching. It's you, Pat, says, Maurice, leave Shelley with me and take these people out in the street. The two former rival, Videa Condesend, and one another. Buchanan is winning on points until he pushes it one inch too far. Whereas the Kag, Maurice, he shouts, go get the K. Maurice looks up, Lix's lip and says, hey, Pat, you're on a... employed now, then he turns to the cameras. He needs a job! More ace claims to the world's news media. Or else, he'll have to take on employment. Gerald Ford and George Bush's big no one around the Canada lessons. All eyes focus on the trouble, he was giving serial interviews to the netwants. At last Nancy Reagan appears to rule a giant rhyme, which is strange. The public in the hate is if he's already done. Whereas Nixon, who is action time, is treated as if he was still alive. She is followed by Colin Powell. Then comes what I am sure will be the defining moment of the convention. How raises his voice above the crowd and proclaims his belief in abortion rights. The convention rises to its feet to a bond. I turn around meet between his games. Any reaction I am idiotic when meeting certain citizens. It is as if… possible to be some point. What he said, any reaction I shout, but the noise from the crowd is too loud. Just in front of me, oddly enough, there was a man dressed in a monk's robe. From the back of the robe, he's a son, it reads, the oxygen he went through the streets carrying a lamp. He held it up to start. and said he was looking for honest man. Dolves has invited Mori to join him on the stage Thursday night, but Mori has, for the second time in his many days, declined Dolves in the tension. He figures that would merely be another meaningless street for all with everyone who ever thought of running for office planned on the stage. Although Mori's age pleaded me to try to change his mind, I can't honestly tell him he's long. Nothing personal, though he's still irritated to Dolves' lack of sense to dress seven and writing for it was on motorcycle. It's just that convention life is less than this prank up to date, it's deciding. In the morning, he's playing with taking, and his friends, to Las Vegas. ah yeah my Lewis and I dreamt I only learnt how to go through the mismatch I can't tell you who's talking to you and the whole middle of you maybe I'll be happy to be alive and it ain't no big deal I don't even know just the main is I do make me know the universe now you're gonna blame you I'm so sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry A suitable convention, of course, would basically be glorified TV shows, but they're also the stuff of memory, photocenapping and autographs seeking was everywhere in San Diego. While Cassandra smiths, father and grandpa were both the publicans, black Republicans, because of the epic of San Fariance and the conservative Lincoln, and they were trying to change the Republican Party from the inside. And she has this memory of one convention? I can't swear that I was the only 10-year-old Negro girl with the 1960s Republican For the scarcity of black Republicans, especially as enthusiasm goes my father. I think I can make the claim. You'll see democracy and action, then, promised. Yes, this is three in the making. You'll be the only kid in school to see Dick Nixon and person. I wasn't impressed. I just seen Seaky Sails in the State Fair, and Nixon was only a vice president. Besides, I've seen his face every morning when I came downstairs for breakfast. Above the fireplace, and the kind of republican shrine surrounded by a great china elephant in the stack of i--pike buttons. Above the photo of my father, John Smith, and Richard Nixon shaking hands. It was taken in 1958 when Nixon was vice president, and daddy was one of nine young republican vice chairman. They are standing total to a wingtip to wingtip. Their hands clashed in a no nonsense handshake. They even look a little  Sam Hightenville, the same oversized wear head, shiny gray suit, and tent unwavering stare. I understand now that these bottles were staged in a party faith, but in 1960 I thought the Dick Nixon and my father were best friends. Blood brothers would cut their palms, blasted them together in a sacred ceremony, preserved on film. was proud of that photo. Framed it, bragged on it, and made sure his daughter's kept it dusted. As far as he was concerned, he and Dick were conrads from the front lines. His old friend was about to be promoted from Vice President's President's President, and we were traveling to Chicago to cheer him on. We'd been in Chicago a couple of days, and mother and I still couldn't get into the convention. Every morning, Daddy at left his waiting while he searched the spec. when we finally got inside the seats were in the nose blade section. I was troubled. It makes an idea to hear such good friends, why are we sitting up here? The next day we were in law. The Republican women had planned to wear yellow dresses to a demonstration. Mother wore hers and we slipped onto the convention floor. What kind tell you about a convention from the eyes of a 10-year-old? Mostly I saw it. Belfuckles, grass and bells. Red white and blue balloons, the crush of bodies, funny hats, popcorn, the smell of old spice and aqua velva. Growing up shouting and pushing my compunch of kids, crushed toes, Texans and tin gallon hats, and gold water delegates never gave up trying to make me wear their buttons. We joined the parade of Republican women, marching round and round with floor, demonstrating four or again something. Somehow we were spotted as frauds and led through the exit doors and into the midday sun. The International Ampitheater was in the middle of the stockyards and although most of the slaughterhouses it closed, the smell of death was everywhere. nearby, darling and company, the last of the rendering firms was boiling down hides, hooves, heads, tails and the blue. When the win was right, you could smell it as far as... high park four miles away. But on a winless august day we couldn't breathe. We covered our eyes and mouths. We begged the guards to let us back in, for send a message to the father. We were stranded, alone, and a vacant lot overgrown by weeds. I now, I had it with the feats, and decided the photo was a fraud. The convention nothing but a stage circus. We had been abandoned, locked out. I still haven't found a political home. This year, the Republican talk about included makes me nervous. They repeat it too often and with two little evidence. But this week, for the first time since 1960, I had a calm political discussion with my father. I was surprised, although he's proud of Colin Paul, and still likes to be public and economics, he feels his left-out as I did. The party hasn't changed yet, Mitted. They don't want us, not less you do with a Italian. That's my problem. I never did with a TOLD. And for the first time, he explained to me the reason we didn't get tickets to the convention floor in 1960. The State Party leaders wanted him to run for the one office usually reserved for blacks. If study ran for a mainstream position, and one, and that's how we ended up in a bacon line. smell the death, how they know the doors to get in.
