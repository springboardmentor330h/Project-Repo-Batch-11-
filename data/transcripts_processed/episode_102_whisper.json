What I  most about Greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on bus. Airline passengers left complaining about the five, excruciating me long hours and takes to fly from coast to coast. But on the bus, that same distance takes three full days to go, which is what I think is about the perfect amount of time to be there. And unlike airplane flights, no movie. are shown on Greyhound, no headsets handed out, no free magazines available, no waitresses force bags and peanuts on your every five minutes. On the bus, passengers are largely left alone with your thoughts. I have this theory about people who ride Greyhound, about how as we sit on the bus for hours and days waiting to reach our destination, we travel on what I call the transitional state, thinking about where we're coming from and where we're. going to. I know I do and for my talking to other people on the bus, I know many others do as well. For example, this one route I've written in life goes up from Custom City, California, home with a Pelican Bay, Max Moons, Security Prison. I wrote next to this guy who'd been locked away for 14 years and I just got no. Across the aisle from me was a teenager with a buzz cut on his way to usan. We talk for a while, we listen. we just sat and thought about what places we were headed. For a long time I've been wanting to tape record the stories I've heard on the bus, the document is phenomenon that I've been trying to figure out. So I was pretty excited when this American life offered to send me on a greyhound trip, the fancy tape recorder at a seven day Amirapass. For a week I could want to any greyhound route to chose and test my theory about the bus. So I packed up a loaf of peanut butter and... and a bunch of bananas and stepped on a greyhound. It spent the first 10 hours traveling down the coast of Oregon. I saw eager to talk with the other passengers, the state of wake all night, even though everyone else was sleeping. It wasn't until we stopped for breakfast, in the present city, as finally able to strike up a conversation. Steve was about 50 years old, supported a bushy beard and worn all of green army jacket, a large wooden crucifix tangled from his neck. The city was an itinerant creature, and that greyhound was his chapel. theволous birds interaction coming with the Well, I just preach in my own time, , not in specific times.

But Steve took offense and pulled out a bottle of ambassau, which he described at 60% grain alcohol plus pens of cane, which is a chemical similar to the natural recurring cocaine. And so, what's it for? Well, it's just a little topical anesthetic, which is  a local nummer. And so they talk about two thick things in that nature, just something, certainly not a central. nervous system relaxens  the open pop which I consider more of a value. It's just a little nip. Just a little nip now. Was that numbing your whole mouth now? Well it takes a, takes about 10, 15 seconds. It's not actually there isn't a meeting but, yes, this is actually Leave your thoughts. Coming. And very pleasant. Steve continued talking, but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurred. By the end of our 15 minute talk, he told me it was the longest conversation he had in the last 3 and 1 half years. And Steve got on the northbound bus, bound for Portland, and I continued on to San Francisco. I wrote 10 hours to Los Angeles, sitting next to an 11-year-old kid. that didn't want to talk to me. The Hollywood bus station I saw a bus head of Perseirantisco and figured what the heck maybe I had to get lucky on that bus. So I spent the next 10 hours retraced my route back north, sitting beside a guy and slept the whole way. I had to wonder where were all the talkers? All those chatty passengers that usually sit next to me and share their story about where the coming from were going to. In Reno, I switched to a bus route I've always been curious. about. The one that headed south in gold mining towns down to Las Vegas. My attempts to find out who wrote that particular bus led nowhere. I approached the other half dozen pastures one by one, no one would talk to me. When the bus from Las Vegas to Flag Staff Arizona, I asked the woman sitting next to me to record our conversation for the radio. She acted  I was nuts. You want to talk to me about Greyhound for the radio? What station is that? Well explained. It's a show that's on different... stations in different cities. What station is it on in Los Angeles, and she has? Los Angeles? I'm not sure. You want to record me for the radio? You even know what station it is? Yeah, right, she's got. Give me a break. She alerted the other passengers around us that was trying to post up an overrun. Soon as verbally assaulted from all sides, but of everyone's jokes, I put the tape recorder away and stare at us. the window. When enthusiasm for this trip is rapidly equivalent, at a rest stop, distinct away from the pack of passengers who are smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing, stood off time to some. Maybe I'd been wrong. Maybe there wasn't anything significant on the mind to bring up as news after all. I'm a small break-ended, I reluctantly got back on the bus. And any bus is really some sort of podcast. the drunk guy smells  urine for the woman's babbling for some. And a down dump. But these dorky headphones on my head just put along microphone in here. Trying to get people to let me interview them about where they're going. It was me. I was the weird one on this bus. Hello. Well. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. in this bus, we made a couple people in this bus and with that. That's nine more hours to go in the bus, we're getting on the bus to the right middle of the tether. So, then is my cell. We are somewhere in the dether. See what's happening in the house. Clear blue sky, and you can see it out. 30 miles in the whole lot of dirt rocks. I guess I didn't have much more to say than anybody else in the past. All these years I've posted a thing some sort of party greyhound passage. You probably have told us, thank you. that many people can play about, the seemingly never-ending rides, the annoying passengers, the faster phobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and there's no big deal. I sat across the aisle for people having noisy sex that it did bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me. And past the Phoenix, and I saw a wedge between the window and a guy who got way too much of my seat. I tried to sleep for the first time in days, but found that I couldn't. My whole body was sore, had shooting pains in the back of my thighs, my back ached, I had a headache, the baby in front of me cried all the way. The toddler behind me got smack ground for not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy as becoming increasingly claustrophobic as beginning to lose it. Normally I survive long bus ride by concentrating on my destination, but now I didn't have a destination. I wasn't really going anywhere. How could I expect to find anyone in the transitional state when I wasn't even in transition myself? Maybe this was the problem with prohibition. And it ceased being a regular grey-hand passenger. I was an outsider. I stood in line for the bust of last cruisest he mixed, crying to come in. I thought I was in control to my watch to murder drag or kidney-prime-tubber, perhaps the bust-ation. I couldn't take it. I couldn't handle being constantly surrounded by so many people anymore. It sure wasn't feeling at home I usually did. Step that aligned for their last boosted space. I had to get home. Sadly, Portland was still at 36 hour ride away. At Arizona in California, border, newpfastos. that down across the aisle. Not needing any more abusive strangers. I resisted my initial temptation to talk with her. A couple miles down the road, I watched her pull a Polaroid photo from her purse, stare at it for a half minute, and then took it back on her purse. Min later, she had the photo out again, and this time I snuck a peek, saw that of the photo of her sitting in the lap of a guy wearing a present part. Since she had boarded the bus in the prison town, I realized she had probably just visited a jailed boyfriend or husband. Now she had to sit. on the bus for Uno's how many hours, and dwell upon the person she had just left. At last I thought, the one person I've been looking for in this whole trip, someone in transition, someone who could help me prove my theory about the bus. Her name was Lisa, and she was just as suspicious with me as any other passenger. But she did consent a lot to our conversation before. Arizona. Yeah. Here's another one. Nothing great. I mean, no. Conversation didn't get very far. She gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions. Eventually she ended up asking me the majority of the questions. After a couple of awkward minutes, I put the microphone in a tape recorder away. She stared at her photographs a more while I watched the desert in the fading sun. So, are you ready? 2! 4! I'm a day off! After the bus had darkened, people closed up. Lisa tapped me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandma. Powers with which she could grant me any wish I desired. For this service, she'd only charged me $5. At my shop, she said, usually I charge $10, $20 for a wish. She said it's just  that, $10, $20. Well, $5 for a wish seemed  a bargain. So I started counting out the hundreds of nickels I had won in a Las Vegas slot machine. but she said it only worked with a five-dollar bill. I didn't have any files. I did have a 10. A 10-year-old worked, she said. I followed her instructions, holding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her. She squeaks it in her fist and said, now make a wish, but you can't tell anyone what it is. So I made a wish. Then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes. That these wishes were important too, but not as important as the super important first wish. Well, in my state I only had one wish that I needed to fill in. So I just made stuff up for the merely important second of third wishes. Wishing for better health and the new romance. In the dark bus, she whispered across the aisle, ensuring me that I was now in better health, and then I could expect a new love in my life. Then she asked me to tell her my super important wish, my number one wish. But you told me not to tell me one, I said, you can tell me she said, but don't tell anyone else. So I told her I wish I wasn't writing the lesson. Oh, she said, you're tired of writing the bus and see it in your face that you're very tired. You have a time face. Just whispered about my face and described how tired I am in five minutes. I mentioned three times that while I might be laughing on the outside, I was really crying but I wasn't laughing. I did. on the outside. Once you're done, I watch her sit my 10 in her pocket. Meanwhile, I was still on the bus. This question of people would be putting out a new issue of his scene, dishwasher and a few weeks grab a pan, send him a dollar, you can get it. A K-O box eat 2-1-3. Putlandorigam 97-2-0-7. I can , great health and real writing style, where I go from close to close to these comfy seats all the time. This is my heart, love to treat you for all the love and peace of mind. We're at the orange seat, right now, we're living down, feeling  we're in a thrill when I'm going crazy. Back to, mercy. A road trip can be a profound test of any relationship. After our expectations are high, everybody's looking for a good time, and at the same time, you're in circumstances that can make anybody irritable. Probably because you're together all the time. All the time. Because of this, a road trip can save a marriage or destroy it. We bring you this case example, toyed by Carmen Rivera and Candido Terrado and Emerique. Thank you so much for this. A couple years ago, a friend of Carmen started to get married in Italy. The friend was already married, but the friend had not pulled in parents. So she decided to get married again on her anniversary in Italy with a parents person. So we think it's a good idea, but when I really show her people want to go with she. invited to the wedding. We're not really sure because we had gone to Italy the year before and we're kind of not getting along. We were not communicating and we're kind of angry at each other and it was  this atmosphere of a general malaise in the house. Malais. That's who it was. Lord, you want to call it. Fighting. I changed the TV channel. I mean we forgot about everything. I'm a lace. Okay. Okay. So we're in this malaise. And so we haven't decided yet. And we get a phone call from Paris, from a friend of ours, Malica, who invites us to stay in her house in Paris. And we tell her about the wedding in Italy. And she goes, why don't you come stay with me and then we'll all go together to Italy. So I think that's a great idea where we can kind of be with friends. We'll meet you in the next video. when she says Paris, so you don't get the idea. This is an obsession. Every since I know her, she says, I want to go to Paris. Every movie that has Paris in the background, we see every magazine on our look and the old Paris. So I decided to point this first. Okay, that's kind of true. Okay. So I'm really psyched and I'm thinking, okay, maybe we got a Paris, we can work on our, So, , next thing we know, we're in Paris, and it's better than I ever thought it could be. The light was amazing. The architectures amazing. The blue and the blue. It was, it was wonderful. We're in America. The person that was going to give us the apartment to stay. There's nowhere to be found. And we call her apartment and they say the numbers disconnect. So we get it. We get a hotel room in the left. bank and I'm just really overly excited and one day in our way to the I-Col Tower we go through the Jardine and Luxembourg, which is a beautiful park and at the corner of my eye I see chest tables and  I said before he's a chestmaster, he's a national mastery ranks the reason the top 1% of the United States so the last thing I want to see is the chest table. Since I told that is one Look, Andy, look at the puppet show over there. It's not really great, all these little kids look. 10 is courts. Wow, there's so many things to do with this. Chest table, so over here. So we're in this great romantic city, city of love. Most of us are trying to reconnect and suck your arm a lazy. And he spent all his time in Paris, clean chest, nice spent my time. Gone to me, see you, stop  that. OK. That's right. That's right. Good. So then start to go to the wedding. the week passes and you take a train overnight to Paris. Now, excuse me. But we get to Marlena and her friend recall her and she said, yeah, I'll be then 25 minutes comes to pick us up in three hours. And I saw that as a sign that we shouldn't be there. We should be in Paris. Why could we play chess? And comedy when I go back. Because I knew that as soon as we got back to Paris. So it's  no way I want to vacation. I'm going to be here in Italy. We're going to support my friend. I don't want to hear the word. So her friend lives  we thought she lived in the city, but she really lives  in Arkansas. , cow country. So now we get stuck in this house in Arkansas. For the region. For me, Janine. And she drops us there with her non-English Spanish speaking parents. And she leads to the country house and leaves us there and then she can't so's the way And she decides not even to tell her parents that she's married So So we spend that week along with her parents We wasn't that bad They were pretty nice and got drunk a couple of times But we're made of chestnuts and they were very nice to us, but he's complaining again Indies are white Yes, everything's old and it's  a two mom upset those little chess players here. I want to lean I get close to Paul so You start fighting more so we start fighting more and more my friend asked me if I support her decision about the sweat I don't know I mean you're you're 35 years old. You should tell your parents your married And so she's mad at me so she stops talking to me. He's him and I have the one of the hugeest fights that we break up and he says  what I'm going back to power No! So I'm , oh, but I have all the passport. I take care of the tickets. I'm the one that made all the phone calls and French and Italian. So I tell him, okay, if you can figure out on your own how to get back to Paris, you can go. So he couldn't figure out how to get back. So he stayed with me. So I knew how to go back. I just didn't know how to speak. The language to get back. Okay, all right. So the next stage of this whole trip is to go to Portugal. Have it. So we all go so my friend is back there they're fighting and we're fighting and we wind up in course now course It's been there but it's  the ugly place I've ever been to and This ugly rocks coming out from the ground and So I'm not really happy here and I feel more more close to public is now. I'm in another country So we write down and we turn the mountain and we go to the south of Trust course it got me to the fact that you were the most serious and they turned and we come up with a beautiful town and the other people they weren't camping so we were going to go camping with them because I'm camping in New York I'm not traveling across the world to go camping so they get very angry at us of course another thing to be angry about and we get to run the patches  the most one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. It's built into the rock and it looks  Monica, this is gonna be white, very romantic. Our friend drops us off in a hotel and she goes, well see you next week and she just dries off. Now, we don't have work, we don't have chairs, we don't have our friend, I know we have left, we know that since our general maleids are okay. So we start first when I really talk into each other and he's really upset. He's  . we saw, secondly, that it is to me, , I could have been in Paris. But then we started taking mobs, we have really not much else to do. So, it's a beautiful pre-store town and we start kind of connecting and talking about the history, one morning meeting in a really great place, beautiful restaurant that's built into the rock. And it's a very clear day and we're in the patio and you can see on this morning view. And in the dawn it was wow, two Puerto Rican from the Bronx and here and then we just started me in the spirit of today. And I look over to Gandhi doing , wow, we're glad I'm sharing this with you. I was feeling the same way. So Sunday morning was in 7th and she calls and she says, okay, we done series in 20 minutes. We go down there, it's 20 minutes, she comes, we get back in the car and it took 12 hours to get back to for a vegan. There's a lot. ride this very little while riding Italy and in those 12 hours of me said we're and she was really upset and we're kind of feeling good but we just reading the vibe and we're  a cave she'd say. The next morning we packed and we supposed to be leaving about four to pass the five to five train and she was she comes somewhere about 12 o'clock to go to Parminol. She was to talk to me private and she brings me into this office and she has a really big house and she says me I'm really mad at you because you didn't talk to me in the way back from course. And , I don't know what's up with you and you didn't go camping with me. You went to Paris first and you said you were going to come here earlier. But you were here too long in my house and you used up to use the washing machine and , Oh my god, make up your mind while you, , if you're upset and you just pick some things. I was so confused and then it dawned on me kind of notice this. This is not the French you by thought it was and I'm , well,  what? I can't I'm not going to deal with this I'm out here. She's , fine get out of my house right now So I get go go go go go go go go go go go go go The back your chest I carry my chest folks with me Yes, chest book and my chest board, , we're happy so I don't feel  a chest We don't anymore so it's okay. So I got time we have to be so we packed and now it's with packing And I know something's going to happen. We have to have that blow up, We go outside black cloud rain top of the house I started to reign on top of the house. It wasn't raining any other place. There was sun all over the place I slept in top of the house. So I said okay, this is the universe. , playing the trick on the house. God laughing at us and my mother says take them to the train station. I'm not sure there's no anything. So I know we're not gonna make it to a train station. Because in the car we're gonna come to vlogs. So she takes the back roads down the tomato fields and she begins to build. Rado. She just rehashes the whole argument all over again and how that we couldn't make it on our own to the train station. We had done it. We had done it. One, two, one. We had to stun it in the forest. All right. That's right. That's true. So she says, if you don't let me speak, I'm going to throw you out of the car. So we said throw ourselves out. We should do it. She gets out of the car. She takes all her bags now. She's , yeah. I never want to see you again. It starts to traffic. I mean, there's  50 cars. Now looking at other people's cars. And it's us. We're bags walking down this this this road. We have a car. We go the bags in the car. And suddenly we feel free. It's our laughing. We start laughing. And we never feel so free in these three weeks. And as we walk down this, , it's  five miles away from the train station. And as we walk down this gray narrow road, I started thinking about the the soldiers and what were two and what was so and they were going home and they have won the war and Carmen and I walked out of the gym we talked about that this war that we just spent through and it just felt so peaceful and so bright I fell in love again it's really beautiful thank you thank you very much Coming to the very end, can deal with a lot of trouble during the evening traveling, stories, how about math, playwrights, and age friends. It's very pretty. Coming up, Martinez everyday, El Productor's scars, no fresh fruit of vegetables, four high school cheerleaders to get them to job, this one long road trip, and worth 90 to your own marriage plans. I will miss a town. It's a minute. I'm a great international. We're not problem-tons. American life from our class.

There's nothing wrong with a book in our students. fact it's liberating. You can say whatever you want to them they will not remember. 10 years ago, Porter Marguerak from St. Petersburg magazine School of George Bond, for 92 years of his been a lot of time. 25 shows a year of conventions and other one-night gigs, plus week on St. Degas in�sidden. This is a story of road trip business, not question. St. Degas on to Raj in its entirety at that time included Irving Fine, and then 77 year-round manager. Morty Jacobs is a piano player for that time, 23 years. In the start it was queer monthly. There were kind men, the white men, the coder kid, the way they caught everybody kid. They reminded her a lot of some of her older jewels relatives. This is blip screen. 9 o'clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho, University. We sit around in the common living room that connects George and Irving's bedrooms. George and Irving. serving always get connected bedrooms with a living room in between if they can. In the late afternoon when it's quiet, this is where George and Irving  to sit. They watch television, they read the trades. Right now, Morty's here. The sun is set and it's early evening. In general, they have three main topics of conversation. The act, the schedule, and where they want to eat. Here's some typical dialogue. Morty will say, where should we eat? And Irving will say, the broiler room. It's the hotel stay camp. And then George will say, John will know John's a hand for who could set up at the airport and drove us to the hotel. And then Irving will say, I think we should do the Brewerer. And then George will say, John will know, ask John. And then Irving will say, I'm making a reservation at the Brewerer room, but not move towards the telephone and on and on and on. It's  dialogue that David Mamma would write. If David Mamma wrote scenes were absolutely nothing was the stick. We head down to the board. All through dinner there's this constant craft of math, including at one point four cheerleaders. They're wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the row. Go George, go! They scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their creepyper pom-pawks. And then, plorish over, they run out in a single file as if everything they did. was part of a routine. Then income's the shaft to ask for George's autograph. But George Burns likes his intrusions, he's nourished by them. When it's finally quiet he says to me, aren't people nice? Because I'm a reporter, I'm a blip. But the public gets his full attention. He establishes eye contact with each approaching fan and his smiles at them and he asks how they're doing. And when he leaves the boiler room he'll choose the most complicated route. Slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room, touching people on the shoulder lightly and saying things , don't pay the check. While we're on the road, I probably see him do his act five times. It sounds totally spontaneous. he's making it. right there just ripping for the crowd even though give it take a gag or two it's the exact same act as we do in 15 years I'm glad you put that standing position. She has a rule in the way you get to standing position. What's amazing about all this is that on the served by the people who are not in the same position. What's amazing about all this is that on the served by the people who are not in the same position. The act doesn't seem to vary from city to city, but to George it's an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he'll decide to sing young and heart before old bones. When he does this he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he's been able to be on the roads for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself. Sometimes he'll change it punch once. He has a gagness act about people having to retire when they're saying. He says, when I was 70, I had pamphles, but one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, when I was 70, I had cupidzagema. I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I'm going to be the one to tell him. In fact, I have tape of this of myself lying to the nicest man on earth. Well, all you think that is cute. Is that , I don't know, young, , , , soft-dating this? Yeah. But, okay. Is that? No, not supposed to be. No, it's not theory. A cube when I was 7, I had two. It's the one. It is  writing it. You're making it right. If you're doing all the cubes of the same rules, you'll be everything. For a team I was doing. A rat. A rat. A two-piece. A rat. A good one. A rat. What's that? A rat. A rat. A rat. A rat. A two-piece. A rat. A two-piece. Virgin Irving can go on  this for hours, so they go back and forth and back and forth. And that night, George tries out the cupasix of my line. It doesn't get laughs. On the way home in the car, we're silent. George had driver in the front, me and the back squeezed the hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George is rumbling voice cuts to the darkness. I'll never do that again. He says. It's quiet for a while more. Marty, he says, tomorrow night, let's. And then the conversation starts all over again. Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour. I've not had to be anywhere at a certain time. You want a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There's no accountability. But that's a civilians' launcher. Their RAGON is being so I am on a very different kind of road. The road trip I'm on is not about adventure and unpredictability. The road trip I'm on is about making sure that everything is the same. This is a secret to George Burns' longevity of how he's been able to stay on the road for so long without going crazy. He wakes up at a certain time, goes to sleep at a certain time. When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a park. he stipulated his contract that he'll be provided with a back and still to sit on, a lightly re-re-historical strung, an asterate of what his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis, chased by a couple of black coffee. He will only smoke Elperton terms. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh root vegetables. By the end of our time together I could order for him in a restaurant of necessary. He likes Bay Shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn't care what brand of liquor they're made with. You just want him to come one after the other. He is 92, and no one can tell what is good or bad for him to put his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it. As a Jennifer Muth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night, he recites to me a particularly memorable lemric that involves emails, the phrase, Hickory Dickory Dog, and a reference to his own private parts. Morning, Irving, Laugh, but I don't know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I'm scared they're gonna think I'm some sort of slack girl. And if I don't, then I'm a pill. No fun at all. I feel as if I'm in another country with different customs and more of it. And so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other. Laugh, they ain't grown in, shaking my head. Waiting for something that works. The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning during coffee, wait for Irving's call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shared carbon hotel rooms and stare up at the sea line. One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George C.E.E.s breakfast. What's on the grid? Yeah. I was in it. Yeah, I could have got one of something for you. OK, I already have breakfast. Good. Yes, I did. Yep. George is wearing a thick beige Terry cloth bathrobe beige pajamas and slippers. His stiff gray to pay somewhere in the other room. It's startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heel shoes, the crisp pexator. He looks vulnerable. have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by this man. My view then comes to change as we spend more time together. The 11am Reno Nevada, Bally's hotel. I'm trying to keep my focus, but I'm tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Oving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answer to my machine picks up. Finally, I take the elevator to the hotel casino. I play the slot machines, mindlessly pulling down the human goal. Somehow, Oving tries. I'm playing the quarter slots. I'm risking a grand total of $10, but he's positive that I will return home, having handed over the title to my car. He goes away, then comes back and tells me it's time to quit. He goes away, then comes back 15 minutes later, and tells me again. I'm annoyed it is nagging, and touched. To save me from financial ruin, he asked me to take a walk with him. Irving takes my hand, and loops it past his bent elbow. I'm an arm, we strove past places with me. names  the MAPES hotel and the Liberty Bell Salon. The way Irving is almost balancing down the street lets me know he's enjoying that we come off  a mismatch couple that I am his babe and he is my Silverhaired energetic sugar daddy. Most of the time Irving does a talking and tells me about his paths. It's a history of 20th century show business, big jobs, CBS radio and the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It's a long story. every once in a while though, Irving asked him to personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend, and then we hit back to the hotel. And when we get to my room, he drops me out with this thought, he says, leave your boyfriend, he's no good, find someone else. He walks away and I stand there feeling conflicted. I think I'm no longer a blipder, but who does he think he is? He doesn't know me, he's never met my boyfriend. A couple of years later, I followed his voice. And every once in a while, I think back, trying to remember what it was that I said to him. What allowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk? How come he knew something that took so long for me to figure out? All I could come up with was how transparent I must have saved his name. Transparent  teenagers are the main. I mean, how many different human stories are there? Minnesota, darling. Finally, we're on the road for so long that George is treating me  old-ness, which is where you want to be with George.

The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one-true talent when he met Gracie Allen and he stayed married to him for 38 years. He was the brains of the act, the one who wrote almost every word she said, that she was the one who the public loved. He tells me that since her death in 1996. before he visited her once a month at Forestland Cemetery so he can tell her what's been going on in his line. But at first he's needed to see her with so great that he'd go every day. Tonight he shows me the range. Well, Gracey died. He was so terrible to cry. And finally I started sleeping at Gracey's bed. When I would Gracey died that night while we announced at the Week of a distance going to the This content 이러vs will come. Is you want to sleep in? It's always a normal sleep in.

I have to make good decisions. That I... Sure. What do you get? So, you started to do this? I wanted to take this right, get back to work. Oh, I started to work right now. Yeah, that's the business. That's your doing your act, make your lessons, sir. But at that time you were financially solved. That's a me good plenty of money. Wasn't it more interesting to take your mind off the day? -huh. But you enjoy it. That's right. Okay, so at that time was it more to sort of, , to not wait until you do it around. How long would you do to celebrate that? You sit on the car. How long did you grow? Grab two hours? You grow! You grow! You grow! You're feeling bad! Have we tried to become home? You're just there. One night years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in West Los Angeles when I saw George. I'm going to sit at George. with a couple of men and a younger woman. They all hovered around to meet each other. He moved slowly and was so tiny that he seemed to be lost inside the dark suit he was wearing. They all slipped into a red booth in order dinner. I think the waiter tried to origin my team. When it was time to go I walked right by and but I didn't say well. The George I was always at work just another friend of mine. What you are going to do is make is in right and in the same to us. Act 4. Prophecy Jesus. So what we want on the road, many of us, is adventure. And what is adventure for the moment? Or series of moments. You never could have predicted before you left your home. We have this story about one such moment, for sure, we're trying to wanting to listen to us with a children in the car. The story. It's 1990 and she's wearing a 1977 bleach blonde fairer faucet feathered-dough and electric blue mebbling mascara which, contrast nicely with the line green polyester, manager's pantsuit she's got on. And she's telling me now, not for under $50 a night. Not for under $50 a night, will she let me leave my car in the parking lot of her. Oh, Michigan Speedway Convenience store gas station. this after an hour and a half of my going in and out, buying chips and juice and cigarettes. wondering what I'm going to do with the four links I've borrowed from my friend, which is now that I split valve or something and it's busted all the hell, and I'm in the middle of goddamn nowhere on the other side of Dujia. I got my way to Calamazoo for a getaway weekend. I wanted to see American. I ask her why I can't leave my car in the parking room. She says it's the rule. I ask her to make a decision about that rule. She says she does. She says, company, policy. Well, who's company is it? She tells me a term company and she doesn't break the rules. Why, you little. Hey, I can't you be a friend. I'm thinking to myself. I'm a friend. say, the point I'd  to. Instead, I remind her very softly about American hospitality, and how Americans are known the world over for their friendly, peaceful, helping nature. I tell her that I noticed on my way in through her charming little town, a sweet and simple church with a banner out front that red bull yet humble, pop off for Jesus. There are a few customers in the store, so I say it again. Loud her. Pop off for Jesus. POP OFF FOR JESUS! An older gentleman with an Abraham Lincoln beard and an Elvis Presley cloth, stairs at me blankly. The manager tells me to cut the crap and get out of the store. Okay, I said, I look at her name badge, Mary Ann, oh, get out of your store. But I ain't never coming back to POP OFF, and I turn and walk away. As I walk away, I accidentally shove my body against a candy bar to split case, knocking over hundreds and thousands of people. Three musketeers, Reese's special dark and snickers, sweet tarts fly and spill, a grand gesture of public nuisance. That's it, Mrs. Maryann says from behind the counter, your big city ass is cut. I'm calling the police. You, idiot. I think to myself, am I way out the door? Do I look married to you? I make it to the highway, no. time flat, speedwarp backwards with my thumb near calling out to passing cars, pop off her jeezes, pop off her jeezes! A few cars honking away, but nobody stops. I can't imagine it might be what I'm wearing, same jet black carc child dress I wore the night before. Maybe my lips took a blue-bride red for broad daylight in small town  pop off. Maybe I just don't seem I belong near. Only event pulls over. It's a Chevy van, one with a mural painted on the side setting up the circuit by bed and video it is. Ficting what King Arthur and one of your might look  in the year 2500. King Arthur wears a gold, mesh, nuclear cleanup suit. There is a sword in one hand, and a laser gun in the other. One of his new, and amply bucksome, where her pubic hair might be, she holds the holy grey-el. The driver leans over and opens the door. It's man! What a surprise! I get in. The asktower is he's never seen me before. Maybe because I don't pose nude for playboy. I've mentioned up playboy, he steps on the gas, speeds it to 105. I've never gotten 105 and he's Chevy van before, it feels pretty good. Faster I say and we both start laughing. I will down my windows to climb my head out and yell pop off of Jesus to the wind. I feel  taking up my top, but I don't. I step back down to the passenger seat. It's barely vinyl, light a cigarette, and enjoys best-eye candy, REO's speedwagon tapies pop blasting. He asked me why I'm here, Chikin' and just as he does, the Sheriff's car speeds past his own way back into town, that's why I said, cops! What have I got against cops? He wants to know, nothing. It's just that I'm allergic to poor. It occurs to me at this point to shut up. I really don't know this man, and... health. we heard he is, brother of Mary Ann, manager of the Speedway. He was daughter of the sheriff of Pop-Hop, and that I am headed for a trip. And in one great whirling moment of brilliance it becomes very clear to me what I must do, and that is sham, this bit. It is not that difficult. I've seen it in movies. Before Treet Williams gets his hair shaved in the woods, barely dang, and those tells a four-door fort from an army office, by seducing him down to his underwear. She takes off with his car, his money and his clothes, which is exactly what I mean to do. To prepare myself at this role of a lifetime, I changed the tape to Hotel California. The next neck is nasty with sweat, which I ordinarily wouldn't mind, but it has the stale sweet taste of a flat mountain do. I forced myself to enjoy it. By the end of the last resort, New Kid in town wasted time and wasted time reprise. He is down to his food of a loom, and I am wearing dark blue, portable Levi's, Queen concert T-shirt, and a feed cap with an American flag that reached dry burning this one mother F***er. Shortly, I create in him the most urgent desire to pull over to the side of the road. And while I'm straddling his lap, I sum him out, open the door with my foot, and with my very strong legs, kick him out. of the van down onto the asphalt , his stunned sorry eyes looking up at me in surprise. Did you lose something? 30 miles or so up the road I spotted your chakon. Hmm, somebody needs a ride. I pull over. She's a frosty little lousy bell with a shaped head in a backpack.
