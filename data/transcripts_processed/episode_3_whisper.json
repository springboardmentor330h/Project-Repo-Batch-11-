Yes indeed in the late 1960s the winged warrior Chicken Man struck terror in the hearts of people do is everywhere when Chicago radio first and then across the nation. Tonight we're going to bring you a historic first first new episode since 1969. Wait, that would be late. Later, see if this word is savvy broadcasters here. Even though it's public broadcasting, we're gonna make you wait to later in the show for that in a minute. You're turning in for that and make you wait Okay, to return to our store Danielle's family the power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve Chicken or turkey they call it that's right and they call it this for a reason And the reason has to do with this stuff, hand puppet. Call duck. A little background. Danielle is 28 years old. Editor at details magazine in New York City, fashionable magazine. Her sister Ashley two years younger. Now a graduate student at the University of Michigan. And Duckie has been in the family since they were children. Well, here's a Christmas present when I was at eight. Introduction Sirias And when he first tried, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful fluffy white duck. And he had a cape on and black kind of villains, black hero goggles. I guess we call it hero goggles. And I think he was, because there's an ass on his cape, I'm sure he was supposed to be  super duck or something. He's a puppet. He lost. He lost. He's a duck. The outfit. pretty quickly, anyone can make it. And then he became actually real call for a true name. No, it is not unusual for older siblings to dominate your friends and as children, 10, yeah, pretty much the dominate Ash and always got her way except. When talking about and basically what would happen is actually channel. Let's go to the minute. and the macronistic things that were in the sun. So it was actually with channel. That's what she would speak as duck. She would produce the ducky- voice. And , ducky was super-tastic and selfish. And boss, ducky would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks. Whenever Ashley brought ducky to the equation, she'd be completely seductive or ecologist. Howdy, that's him. You may as well compare his personality with Ashley's personality. Ashley's very kind of considerate. She's very considerate and kind and thoughtful. And very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very sensitive to that,  what happened? And then someone else built the yogurt. And that he is probably a total , , what's for lunch attitude? What's in it for me? and you're saying totally out for itself, of simultaneously a braggard and a total whim. He's both, and day. He's just just indomitable. Yeah, indomitable spirit. Wait, , he said, he measured my sister. Right. And he, he, he, he had up to the football team. , he got up to the football team. National race. And he said, and make it, but he said, it was because the authority would be more valuable than that. And they got a good dance too. It's a good, apparently, he does dance, he's got a play in his choice. Oh, he's playing the triangle in the band. Yeah. And you can come over to give him, because we had to be a practice. 18 years after that he arrived in the town. I think probably actually the fluffy whiteness is long. Fluffy is not a word you'd never use that word. No, it's too wide, actually, for a little bit. Physical, what he looks  physical is kind of, he's always slightly pathetic looking gray, odd or saying. Very nice. Very nice. Very sadder. But then the fact that his gray,   what's coming out of his mouth, completely isn't... a quick denial about who he actually is. I don't know, there's something really, really great about that. And really, you have to love the love of love. Okay, I had been at Danielle's house and witnessed the following scene. And he should have seen Danielle is not spoken with her sister in the age. He's a phone. Haulsor's sister Ashley and Michigan. That's what you answer. Daniel, as immediately, in productive your moron, as she essentially, you're becomes Dutch. Put stuck your moron, Daniel talks to that age for 15-20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both go satisfied. I thought that I really loved that. I think if he disappeared, it was. I was really feeling  I'm with that. I looked at him and he was so old and rattied and really makes me sad. I feel , I mean, I mean, I really make me sad to think about the girl's about that piano. It would be a big, empty hole in the world. He kind of takes up as much room in my heart. It's just a lot of people individually. And I would, if he, if something happened to him, . if you would lost an airport or run over by a car, I would be really, really hard-break. So I hope that it's becoming clear why when you eat dinner in the home of Daniel's family, if they are serving some kind of pot chicken, turkey. You ask anyone in the family? What's for dinner? Don't tell you. And vanish. There's ratinox in there. for that it is was what? It's a he out. It freaks him out though because you don't  him to know that that perhaps some friends are hurt. I think he knows I think he's a denial about it. So even denial about most things isn't denial about the fact that he's totally  a weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good looking and soft. And it's really smart and flat of France. Right. So he's a denial of that. that the fact is actually stopped. To you. I'm going to tell him I think that he's breaking his stuff. No way. No, I thought I would try to book that come on the radio. There this show. So a few weeks ago, I contacted Danielle Sister Ash. Hey, I asked her if that came on the air. And I think they'll call back. I got an answer back by electronic mail that product he took here. I would have to call someone named Yona Blue. Who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mom. And when I talk with Danielle, I ask her about this. I've been informed that the Emily that I've reached by calling her mom and speaking to Yona Blue, that name her. Yona Blue, yeah. I think that she's acting as a agent. Yona Blue is. She's a head top. Anything special about it. I should say to you, , dude. I mean, I don't know. She's a pretty, she drives a pretty high bar again. So? Hey, Mrs. Matin. Yes. I'm tired of her class. Mrs. Matin, here's where I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio or that stuff. And I contacted your daughter Ashlyn. And she said that we need to look duckie onto my video show. She's not my video show. I was going to personally be content, you don't know real. Yeah, you wouldn't need to do that. And that I need to do that to you. Yeah. You don't know real. You don't know real. You don't know real. She's kind of up. She's a hedgehog, she's basically taking charge of Debbie's financial business. I presume that's the time she's doing his money. Well, I don't know actually. I mean, that's me. That's probably why it's perfect. Well, so what do I do now? I'm calling you shit. I was called the contact you and if I want to get in touch with you on over You noted folks that What do I do next? You're gonna book that's that's why I don't book that So I'll just Talk to you a little about it. It's okay. Okay I mean we're gonna real one of this does turn something Good talk So with what's all right should I call you back you could call me back or I just go go in and chat you'll just go in and chat yeah should I wait yeah all right away yeah radio yeah not TV it's just radio is up Nobody's gonna get beyond TV. No, no one's gonna be on TV, not strictly radio. Okay,  what does care, what happens to them? What if it were TV? I think she'd want to be on TV. I mean radio does do much for her, just fine. Okay. In Daniel's family. I guess she's thinking this out. There's Duffy, there's Yona Lewis. And then they're ... 4.5 button characters to reads, I can never keep up with the news here. To live in this world that's fleshed out with a lot of vivid detail and drama, they have a club called The Smart Sin. And people are forever following in and out of favor with the smarts. Anyway, their jellacies, their arrival reads, people fight for favors and treats and invitations to ice cream socials. And each of the characters corresponds to some stuffed doll that Danielle and Ashley as children. Though a few months ago, then Daniel and Ashley were talking and they realized that one of the characters died for it. Didn't seem to correspond to any particular doll that they could remember. Were you the two? They attempted to recall this. And then one of them did. Guy Friend is Duckings! Imaginary Pharaoh, Ducky is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend. As you might imagine, nine of you running the family takes all this. So , ten year old father takes it, but he's never too cool. He was quite actually bothered by the whole. He thought we maybe had a problem with the family. Really? I mean, for a while though, we had two daughters only communicating. through a doctor? Yeah, that period you're describing what Wendy means. I would say maybe for 10 and 12 or 9 and 11. And they would only communicate through the doctor? Well, Danielle did pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley's but she paid quite a lot of attention to the doctor. So, we've actually wanted to get Danielle's attention. All we have to do is wrap up the job. Then you'll have to study very fine, but remember, ask? In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, we have to teach real-set, but I have so much kind of genuine affection and love for dockey that is very easy to demonstrate that's beyond. It's not a easy to understand and straightforward, my sister, because you never have to What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship? Well, a really fun part of it based on my relationship with Ducky. But I think I think kind of a big top. I mean, a death on what kind of gives me this vision into a brain that I would have on the life. Well, I did finally snad. And it would be with Ducky. Yes, he just got back from a party though. He just got back from a party though. Yeah, he was at a happy hour thing. Wait, I don't know what it is. Didn't I encourage making the dance so I'll have to just go this half hour. Okay, all right, it would, could you get him? Ah, shit. Hey, Ducky. Hey, Ducky. I'm just fine. Long time no see back at you and work well, and we're going to have a radio program. Hey, let's go on out here. So what's that? Can somebody talk tonight? Well, we actually have a number of different people. What about that's , come through? They're just  conference. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ducky, I was talking to a Danielle. for a radio program at her phone and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn't , you could be much control her with something called nose squeaks. Yeah! She has this kind. It's a prominent note. No, I mean, it has to cut and just want to wait it. , I've been all the things together who are watching her mother child. Yeah. And this video is on. And she reminded me a lot of me. Okay, yeah. And comment problem is taking more of the clock and so it's for me I can look at her And what she moved? Yes she went! Now it's actually a tower which it actually extended the captioned it down down Move the port, but with the effect of that day. Ah! Kind of   me I,  how she loves that you when she doesn't approve of something I or do. Mm-hmm. She gets this half. I've called there and she gives you the sidewalk lamps that make you feel  you're about such a thing. Yeah. That's what she said. She must prep all of me. Is there anything about the life of a doctor that perhaps could tell already audience that we might not know? I'm sure that they need much more of that. Please. No, no. No. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm not really in touch with her. Thank you. You're not a teacher, we'll see you. When I had time, I used to migrate once in a while, because I had some time to adapt. And the trial is to be touched with them, but right now, I have to start trying more time with people, doing my own thing, and I just don't have time to do a kind of stuff thing. I just want to know my life for that. If you're able then down to New Orleans, if you can understand just what I mean.

Be listening to our old brother, exciting episode in the light of the most. Fantastic crime fighter of the world has ever known. The all new chicken man coming up at the end of our show. But next, a real-life story of real-pulturing and real-pulturing farm. Stay with us. We're the end dude. We're the no one hungry. We don't know this train of Marcus big enough sure rest rate. Oh I love the end of it. I love the load of something filled with something My no my next way is the end name. And you run it late. And you're gonna tell me, I don't know where he's eating. Oh I love the end of it. I love the load of something filled with something My no my next room comes here. And I don't think he loves me too. It's a joke. I'm Julie Show Walter, I grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. The night 3000 turkey star. The day before the night that three peck. in Turkey's dime, we moved 13,000 Turkish to the range. This requires some explanation. Turkey spent their first 16 weeks in a heated brood or house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in thinst and closures. Daddy decided we would herd them to the range. It looked simple enough. We made a temperoratious shoot of wire fencing that ran from the double end doors with brood or house, 50 yards to the pan. We would get behind the turkeys in the brood. her house, shut, wave-hole shirts and guinea sat-set them, and they would run out the doors to the shoot into the pen. And that's the way it worked in the first boothouse. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out poshously, then moved to the shoot and dispersed, the rest of her. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. Let's work straight through he said, we'll be done by ten. By the time the turkeys had been in a brood or house for six. weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather part also and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the breeder house, your lungs hurt for a day. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in cold thin house. Tiny barbed pieces feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let out. But we didn't know that then. We moved the temporary fence to the door's the second boothouse. When we threw open the doors, at the end of the second house, it was nine in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight. The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I've seen turkeys clamber against pants trying to get into a range fire. I've seen them rushed toward a streaming child trying to kill it and I've seen them run from a streaming child, scoop and terrifying. These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was  an old adventure movie for the walls are closing in, but there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight whose turkeys were not touched. The yellow louder, waved their cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, daddy walked through the solid, perfect turkeys to break the log jam. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at the time with his feet, stirring them his legs, forcing them into the sun. Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran into panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the two-parer events. By the time Daddy can get the doors closed, at least a thousand turkeys in a skate, and we're running free on the farm, onto our neighbor's farm, into the road. We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery. the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. With a thousand turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this block. 16 weeks of daddy working 14 hours days. Of my sisters and me working alongside in any time we were in school. All for no paying. And if we weren't paid for this block, we would have no cash coming in until the next. block was raised. It took us eight hours to round up the escape turkeys. Poor Abbas trying to track down a thousand birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down and the air was thick and humid. He stopped once for water and my sister billy, the youngest of us, just 11. Bombarded with cold water hitting her stomach after hours, the sun, heat, and dehydration. As she lay on the ground shaking. holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one to sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on. Who may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls or you may think that I'm exaggerating, the self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or that any choice he had was so far in the past, but there was no unwrap when he'd. Years later, when we were grown, we potted lamps to his guilt, his bitterness over what he'd done to us. I couldn't afford niggers until my sister was awake, so I hand dogs. At six o'clock, we read. built the shoot. We opened the doors in the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low in the sky behind them, walked through to the pan. We cleaned up, we ate supper, and we went to bed. That's the day we had, before the night 3,000 turkeys time. At midnight, mother woke us up. We had to get to the pan, and that he needs us. We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out. in the driving rain, flashes of lightning showed daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them one after the other. When people learn I grew up on a turkeys farm, they invariably ask, is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain? Look up at the sky and brown. The answer is yes. Some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that's not how 3000 died in one night. They die because they are scared, and they head all together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close to find protection in the mass of bodies, and they suffocate. We called it piling. It wasn't unusual for a loud noise to pause the piling the brood or house. If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed the door. This was worse. than any pile would soon. Turfies who've never spent a night outdoors, panic, I thunder, lightning, and rain in sheets. All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soap turkeys, throwing them, grabbing more, you don't know if the ones you're throwing or dead are alive. You don't care. Maybe we save some. The next day the sky was cloudless and the sun board down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a plant dead truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days. Well Julie Show Walker, there's in Burrige Illinois and says that she still does eat turkey. Well, twice a year she eats it. And this is the special Poetry Slam Edition of your radio playhouse coming from WBE Transossip the cat of. Say with the sonshu. This is Luis Rodriguez and I'm going to read my poem, the rooster who got into the world. Echo Park Mornings came on the wings of the roosters nine squawk. There's noise unfortunately, also brought in the afternoon, evening, and most hours of the day. The rooster had no sense of time. nor any desire to commit to one. The cock of duty whenever he had the notion. For late-sleepless days sleepers or your pain, ordinary run of the most night sleepers, annoyance, had this wish to see. It was enough to drive one crazy. After now, open my back window that pasty alley just to cross from the backyard with a rooster maid as home. Shut up or I'll blow you a stinky brains out, I guarantee. Great communication, taking. It worked on the Bratsnik store, but the rooster never came with calm, calm, continued a squawk. For one thing, the rooster never gave out a bonafide cockoduro. It sort of shouted out. It happened that rooster lived with three dogs, German Shepherd. The dogs bark through their existence. They barked at everything inside. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow I didn't mind the dogs but when he roost to barks, that's murder. In fact, after Sardronia alongside the dogs as they raised the cross to do it, York barking at passing cars to people. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They'd go right and dang if the rooster didn't go right as well. Now, I don't know this, the redric fish, the fish. I thought I had to story weekly, will need. I could see it now, the rooster who thinks it's a dog. Who knows what booster dementia we had here? And whether the booster chase cats or trees or piston fire hydrants, this wasn't clear. But once I grabbed the heart of the matter, I began to see the booster in another life. I felt sorry for this foul within the identity problem. And I wondered how it must be act when it's owners to chicken bones to the dog, with a nibble on the remainder of its paper hand, but he shared it in the dog. Yet despite the revelation of the Bruce's bark, the problem of sleep in men, then one day a new neighbor, a young lady who often drank herself bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero. I must say though, it was an unfitting in the bird. But I suppose one can totally bark and dog, but barking roosters, that's another matter all to you. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Hey, everyone stop you part of chicken. Chicken is a popular word. I put in the way you go. You bounce too far. Chickenet, milk, butter, some people call it a power. That's the story I heard. But let's call this a, let's call that chickenet, milk, butter. You can boil it roast it, boil it, you can get in the pan or a pot. Eat it with the data, spice on the data, take to watch you got by. It was a dish for us. See you soon. So, in hand with us the... What the lamas was smart, since you get movie, I think it ain't nothing but the... Now, another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crime fighter, the world, has ever known. The opposite of the police commissioner of Midland Sin. Hello, this is the police. Yes, what is it? Please inform the commissioner that I know all set for test secrets. What? It's all private, right? What are you talking about? The chicken missile is over. The chicken missile? Yes. So tell the commissioner I've ready for test secrets. Yes, Miss Elf.

Very nice, yes. Hello, we warrior. Right here, but it's over here. The commissioner said that's very nice. Oh, I'm in that case with someone who have the English name line with the chicken missile. What? Listen. See what 40 you're following. You're all wet. Yes, we're still thing up. Commissioner. Yes. If I would say to you prepare the chicken missile receiver, would  I would think you would. Commissioner. Yes. I would suggest your crouch under your desk. Scrouch under my desk. Yes. It should provide some protection. What? And then chicken is all. Well, say that chicken is all really worth it. Will the middle of Zinnie Fire Department recommend that a chicken vessel receive her be installed? What's left of Midlands Zinnie Horn? Be listening to our old brother exciting episode in the light of the most fantastic crime fighter of the world. as everyone all. More chicken man, that I'll do that to the south. I'm not aiming for him. My friend, Bertah tells me story. Bertah, Bertah makes love for her. Fashion public theater. Posted in the art show called Season X. Anyway, back in 1970, she probably. and she was interviewed about her life, Barbara Wong. And as Verde tells the story, she's on TV, and she writes she's Barbara Wong. And at some point, Barbara Wong is answered, how do you tell the truth it's got? Verde tells, he's held by the sound. This is what the user, this is what we say, basically he knew great and quickly cuts to a commercial. And Verde says, that's always. People's reaction. They say you're crazy, brother. That's not it. They said, , tell me something real , was it 15 minutes, 20 minutes or whatever? I said, you've got to listen to the sound of the grease, listen to the music. So so you have been climbing for years. Yeah. You can tell if the chicken's done purely by the sound. And so to determine if that's true, we've decided to conduct a little radio experiment here with your permission, the other night we fried a chicken. And we recorded it. different stages of its frying. And we are going to play you now for different moments in the frying of the chicken that we've changed the order of. I'm sure you did, I will. Well, I'm telling you up front. And we want you to listen to the four of. And identify which one is the one with the chicken is done. In other words, can you tell that the chicken is done without any visual cues without the help of smelling what chicken is smelling . and it be done purely on the base of sound. Let's roll and our listeners at home can play along with this here. Let's roll the first little sample sound. I would say, yeah. I'd say that's something  the middle. Okay, but that definitely isn't towards the end. Yeah, it's in the middle going toward the end. It's in the three fourth. Okay, let's hear it sound number two, please. Okay, let's hear it sound number two, please. Number two is toward the end, too. Okay, number three. I think that should begin again, at the beginning. That is more difficult, beginning. Number four. It's an ender. It's a good toward the end. Okay. When all those little balls are forming on top, nice crusty. Now, a verdict if you would have to hazard a guess as to which one would be the very last one. So, that's still a nice water tube that's toward the end. And the answer is number two, which means that. Using only the sound of the chick is veritimate grab their kinket close to telling when she can is done. But can't be totally sure of. In short, this was hard. Yes, it was hard. You have to see it. Do  what I mean? Yeah. Oh, it's humanistic series. Yes, you are. We were intensive today and you gotta stay on it. You just can't be talking on the phone Watch TV you gotta stay on that chicken I was asking your daughters today and they were saying how they can also tell of rice It's not that's oh, yeah, that's true Yeah, I talked to that this is a kind of family Listen to the sound a chicken Listen to the sound of the rice You talk to both of them I thought both of them.
