Happy that's a lot of views, Jackson Sharp, Steve, Adacin and Maddie Case were moonlighting, Scully and Motor, Anna Crenan,   the story. They didn't let Susan Erson text the persons. He was a prisoner, sports service in May, first day of the New Simon working in New From New. The calling is ASA's, which is a janitor service there. And they were formally once came in that day, and I'm taking a wee bath in there. through the hall and started to the back of the infirmary and I asked him just where they thought they were going. And he said, how did you take my head off the time or two that day? So, , that was the first time I did your thing. I mean, what is this kind of thing where it was the first time you were there? What do you think of it? No. She seemed around, mopping, crying out trash. And then as always happens in this kind of story. Fate ridden together. together. In this situation where it was the two of them, against the world. We worked together for a couple of months and then got into a situation that involves some real sticky stuff that I'd really rather not get real specific about. But he told me some information that had taken about some stuff that had taken place long I was out of the infirmary one evening. Which brought? But the time I got through facing off people, it brought a lot of heat on both of us. It ended the two of you, actually, brought the whistle and somebody in a way that people got disappointed on the officers. We blew the whistle, yes, the officer got a promotion instead of getting disciplined. They basically had told me I was  a joke. Because I took the word of an innate over that of an office and they didn't  that. And nobody's talking to me. And said, that means again that little brother's time alone, isn't it? Well, I didn't mean that we wouldn't be able to talk to you. Who'd he talk to each other? And I really got to know what kind of a person that he was. And that he will stand up for truth. When no one, , when, after people. will kind of start around it and that he will face what's coming down just so that the truth comes out. That great personal risk to him. Still, his crime? Then, for murder, he killed the man that right Disney's. And he's been given 25 years to life. Umar… Unreal… real in our head all the time, anyone that works there is in the real in your head that these people are out to con you, they're going to pull something on you, they're going to get some blackmailing you to doing something in the heart. This is the prison system's way of looking at things. But not everyone inside the prison system is that way. And that was one of my major problems is I could not understand and I could not treat them word, animals, I just couldn't do it. Welcome to WD's Chicago in Public Radio International, it's a American life, America has. Today on our program, for Valentine's Day, stories that we're bitten about,  one, eat, ball and chain. What happens when you pull along up with somebody who's supposed to treat  an animal? Let's do. neutral person. What happens when you follow somebody that you're country, you're an entire country. It does not want you to live with. That degree. Story of impossible left and also waste impossible out of 1,000 in one of them anyway. Stay with us. Back one. Deep ball and chain. When N-Stack started to call for an immediate insurance and the Texas prison system. She was up. The game starts, who's daunting, is they ever get for chickenful. It was against rules, costly, dangerous. Certainly, they put her job on the line, they were never alone, they could never say anything in front of other people and he was, not to put you find a point on this. I think they did murder her. No, they didn't even relationship. There's some moment of worry, somebody says to the other person, , I'm having the experience. When was that moment of going to, as you had to be? In the infirmary, I had been putting my medications on the computer. you're a chariou and he came in. We've been talking quite a bit that day anyway he came in and said something to me and I turned around looking and I said I love you and he looked right, he's just no you don't and I told him I said don't you ever, ever tell me I don't love you. I said I didn't say I didn't love with you I said I'd love to and it took him a while to accept that because he was of the opinion that that time that I don't he... He didn't think he was really being left. And about two days later, he came back and told me that he's left me too. I was sending him a nurse's station with my head now, I'm sharding when he walked in there. And I walked up and said, hi, he's in hell. When back to charging, he said, I love you. I said, thank you. Right, how? Have you read business life? Well, under the circumstances with other people all around, It comes here to be. How much time was it between him saying that he loved you? And you actually kiss him? About a Mac. And if you're willing to try to imagine if you don't want to talk about this, but what were the circumstances of you actually kiss him first? It's fine. call every day we do we give the incident to the diabetes. I remember. No, that's not romantic. And someone here in Stuck there was a 14 foot riding middle of the sheet on the gurney. And I mean there was a big footprint right there and I followed that and asked him to come change the sheet I'm going to and walking with change in the ceiling for me. is only I took the opportunity to get in. And I was the one who didn't stick in it. Was this a part? Yes. It seemed very surprised. So how did it go? Wonderful. Very, very, very sweet. I would love to be able to put my arms around in my ear. It progressed when they were never in the other other than the Hugs and Kisses. There was never any other sexual activity period. There just couldn't be. That's just absolutely my mother. She couldn't be. They said the given situation was there's no possibility of pregnancy. If we got a minute to talk about the virus, that first... unusual. What was the next turn you come and he's going to understand the concept? We call it another one. It was about the first February. We were standing in the exam room. I was talking about something he was calling you and I was doing something else. And this long guard walked in and it had never been in the exam room. where she had to be, coming and spook up a costume. And he always kept a big pot of coffee going back. And when he left the room with her to get her a cup of coffee, I could just easily pull her head off and talk to her. She died. And that's when I realized I was in way over my head, and there was no denying the fact that I was in love with you. It had gotten to the point that I knew that when we were eventually being discovered simply because I really had a problem staying away from them. And the security staff watches you knock off. So, , it was inevitable. These all makes it for instance the nap. that you feel is with a bit more. Oh, you can talk to anyone or any inmate that has developed a relationship under the circumstances that Amherst was developed and they will tell you beyond belief that the intensity of the relationship and the intensity of the feelings is R beyond anything. that way they've experienced before. I know several of them in that armary to end and then tell you the same thing. You've been married before too. Yes, I was married to two or two or two or two years. And this is more intense than you. Oh yes. I have discovered that I'm never knew what being in love was. Do you worry that your feelings are still idealized because you just... and have them had the times and the show that were wrong. To the point is, there's going to be a lot of adjustments to be done in one of the way, find it to be together. And so what happened there? I'm February the 20th, third. , a guard came in, he and I was standing back by the refrigerator. Fus and he was getting ready to go back to his cell and it was a few minutes until I got off work. And we were talking, cutting up and she reported that she had called us kissing. And what she did not. , that don't hit the kiss. That at that point she did not catch us kissing. Okay. And a little hog light with night. after he went to his cell. The Lieutenant brought him back to the infirmary to do his PhD physical which was a pre-herry detention physical which is meant to be in big trouble. And I asked him what they were bringing down their fort and they said he was under investigation and I did his physical and I kept telling I'm sorry I knew whenever she came and looked at us the way she did. that she was going to be going to be going to the cinema was very sorry that but it was coming there because I knew that it was going to be bad on here. Wait a second. We'll be sure that this right. So he's about to get punished for kissing you and being close to you and the first part of the punishment is that he said to you to be physically examined. Yes. This is not striking. This thing kind of an art. This thing that he's about to be punished. or essentially for the two of you touching. And the first moment of the punishment is, he sent to you along for you to . Now, he wasn't along the legion. It was within the same snow on the whole time. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Okay. I understood. I was around the leaves, the green red that night. Then I was called back on to the green red about 10 o'clock in the next morning. It's kind of, I spent a couple hours in interrogation with the internal fairs people. What they ask me. They, there was a lot of questions they asked about the sexual activity which there was none. They asked if I had been very in-contraming into here which there was none. They wanted me to tell them every sorted detail and I was not real cooperative in that area. Do they have to ask you about your feelings for him? And that's the situation. Yes, they did. They do. How exactly did they ask? They actually asked the question. do you have? Yes. Did you do a meta-vile? Yes. Yes. And then I insist to deny my resignation. Did you guys chat to say the bottom? No. are there on William Castedoo. And they put him in the fields to work. Now when they were talking to him and then in Terrigaine, you internal affairs at Tauri that after it was all over with and after everything calm down, that he would be able to put me on this business to see him. He put me on his visiting list in September. And I brought those in October, so he wrote me, I could come see him me with a week after my birthday. When I went in to sing him, they would not let you sing him at all. One of the officers there recognized me and Tom that I could not visit with him, they stopped him Gagerman major case and he started to his career over again in casting. So he was actually meeting cast to do for 19 months. So he didn't even see me. They never left him out of the building to come to the visitation area. What rule was he violating at that point? You were no longer a prison monument. One of the officers lied and said that they had given him a direct order for him not to put him in a physical team list. I don't know if they've owned the major case on disillusionment right door. And my husband had never gotten the case before. Had never been a really problem swan. No disbonate. problems before. And the steel hurts my pride. The next letter that I got from him of course he was nearly upset because I had stopped the visit and in the very next letter he told me he asked me to marry him. He said he wanted to do that in visitation since they were not really well-respected. He wanted me to marry him. And we, you, we used to cry. , yes. That is one of, I was reading the letter which I, , I was very very happy at that point. And the girlfriend of mine who's already married to the woman was there with me. She kind of got upset because she thought there was something else that there is, but we were all. And she went there and told her that he had to ask me to marry him. She says, well, are you coming? I said, well, of course. So... Hence it worked. Do you... do you... do you... do you basically design simple or use science and quote in the band? No. He sent me what is called a proxy paper out. ... saying that he wants... that he intentionally asked me to marry him that he wants to marry me. And there's some other stuff on. You're not have to take. that in his identification papers in obtaining the marriage license and they got me,  that we got married right here on radio station so that my and my deal about doing it that way is I wanted my husband present at our wedding and that was the only way to do it that that was going to happen put and so then the narrative and present emotional insignia And the host of the show, we have seen these toxic child systems. My name is Vermo Darten. I've had the role of Sarah that was heard. I am glad to be on this program to do this wedding. I go to the end that this is the right thing to do. It was fantastic. It was , at that point in my... I  you could not have told me that this was not the most beautiful cathedral in the city of Houston. Well, now let us start the ceremony. Brother Theg, this is for you. We hope thou have this woman, so that I waited way to live together after God's Holy or in the Holy State of Matthew, with our love. computer, all of a, and deeper, in treatments and in meal. So as long as we both feel real, for Charles, but possibly I do, in man. And what did he hear from us? He heard the word he said. He repeated his house a, a, a, a long, right. And that's what that's what he did to us. This is all. And then he's out. He's, he was, as thrilled with it as I was. To end, we hope thou have this name to thy where it is of the Holy of the State of Mathematical. So as long as we both fill this name, we will ask my brothers to hope they're we all t n imen and from the new to teach them. And to play it as bread and in talking of these files and in talking of these files between us and me, which will never unite. It's such a strange sense of distance to be taken to the power and cross. Yeah, it was. Amen. Amen. Those who guard have joined the giver let no man go to the front. Amen. It's also street street here, a wedding ceremony where there's nobody there. That's our turn to got me, but I'm gonna make it for it when you can't sound. I just have a message for Charles. Sweetheart, I love you very much. I can't promise you that I'll be around through the rest of your life, but I can't promise you that I will love you through this life. And I just thank God that he promised to do it now. Thank you, Eric. I love you. Are you worried that it's going to be different on his house? and we actually get the chance to be there. Sometimes that  the kind of fear of the moment. It's just strange it's a fear that you're the normal somebody who might be married quite a long time. It was in the year now. That's right you had that verse right. The fifth of this year we were married here. That's the happiest years of my life. Even though they're married, when the child's still not  to see each other or are sleeping for them, it's nothing  to put a still on his position for his time to find interviews to let the circle between one and five years of sentence. This world provides us to different sounds. This wall is not free. I can't believe it. I only made a concrete, more quiet. 3. 4. We're in Barware, the soul in May of laundry, and Barware. It's getting up, the story is to hopefully break your heart for this Valentine's Day, in a minute, for Public Radio International, we're in our program for two years. This American light from our glass, each week in a program course which is a theme that is really awesome in bright and warmness, track that and it is more of ground tournament that can import some while께. stories people kept part of the communication together. We have left it at two of our program, back to Mr. Carson. In any love story, there always has to be some things, some moments and ties to bring the two people together. And this next story begins with a man in Amsterdam, lay on the parallel and a woman in Cuba, name of the lady's so soft. And we're brings together from such different worlds isn't it? Music or instrument? That's how it takes my fun. Instrument in this particular case is street working. An antique street working. The egg and meat wood doesn't have a keyboard in it. Crank a handle and it works  a player piano. Growing air through holes in these on cardboard sheets. Well, you own a small workshop in Amsterdam and stores, since I'm next to one. As we punch them with holes, they should better. When the hole is the fastest of a one of the key people jump up in the hole and help in the organ which is connected with this particular key, we'll start the shaft and the shaft. We'll start the organ. In Europe today, these hand crank organs are ancient history. But as it turns out, century ago, these European machines crossed the Atlantic and these days in Cuba, the speed of the factory is still in operation, factory caught in a bubble and fine, still turning out these engines. Naturally, they don't have to see it from itself. Excuse me. So, I'm brothers and sisters at Kuehrlawa Kymish. White sense, ethnicity, rusty people inasse pennies, employers, women. And there she made a proper near tent and there she Morgan with a veterinary precautions next to it. Five people went kung-ga, bungalow, in valleys. It's not very first time because it was just  a real orchestra which was playing gшиеs, stafters. My uncle, one was more than factory, so I made it. He was a cool, calm column. He was going to be a factory that were interested in the audience. And they were going to talk about those versions. In that invited to the other one. I was a little great. I didn't deserve to have been a foreigner. I think he said I could help translate it. This is the idea that we were not allowed. arghhh aghhh aghhh I am seated noteing tonight by Matthew. From transportation community. and on the sudden I see the bleep man who I speak, ah, let me move in this space  a shot. I thought my heart starts to be fasting. Your favourite breath, Dwayds and Blake master's verses note to begin the conversation. It's incomparable, it's been through the absence of a jesteality that you left at the age of 11, 15 times while you spoke about these female And first of all, she took her from the verses and so far, coming home. Everything is always place, and so was complete. You just just love the verse. I just knew that was it was it. We were talking in the song, right? So, I  him. I was forced to move there because we were not there. So I tried to extend, technically, fingers are impossible. So we have to go to every place right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Coming. Come on now, we have to go. so they carted in and into things. Good back. I don't think I'm back here. I'm still expecting. I don't think I'm going to be honest. I'm going to help the fastener adjust. Soon. and this last one. This is the first time I think this is a very bad market. And I'm going to go see my favorite clip to the show. I'm not a person. Cool, August 31st, 1999. Dear Berlin, first of all, my most sincere greetings for you and my wishes are prosperity. For Beginners Let's. I will tell you that I've missed you, I've seen for a week, but you've seen much out for me. You've earned the lead, and 21 year old, instead of finding teachers college. So, I will get teachers soon. I enjoyed your time reading, great story. We'll be very nice to hear about you. You're country. I know that despite the things more country, it's nice. So instead, two teachers produced a deliciousbuddling. My friend, you are not going to leave the house. I'm really grateful for my son. I care of yourself, write some pieces to your ladies. So, I'll start. If it's so famous, you can touch and read again. I'm going to start. to be strong as a mother. Dear Minanis, thanks for the nice letter. I visit you later the 10th of October. There is something on its way for you. How to  it. Love increases the air. And when he said there is something on its way for you, he makes much better song. This is music book here range for love for me. first page can see how he telekated or for me that is from Leon with love. The verses are tender, 95s, nams. The rest is just a cardboard full of poems. He can read it  games. And I do love what to do with it. I don't have no game. I have to go to the culture. This is the day. So Episode Words Such кра Joe Correct Manace Seeti Chris Thank you very much. I don't know why some people are so big. I think September 20th is 1935. There we are. It was so nice to learn that you have not forgotten me. The fact I was afraid about. I am second. September 1935. There we are. Dear me, I am second. And for the earlier I had to come down myself, which was really  crazy. And I said, ready to give me a very warm and good thing to solve. To be sincere, I've read it more than six times today. And now I decided to write a new cue. We can get you think of you too, but I've always been sensitive to your faculty. Dear, dear me, how do you believe me? I said, sorry that if not, you've write a good statement. And in the mornings, when I... I have a prize, I can see my hand on the moon. So you have to write that way soon because it's really hard. Hey, that's it. Can you imagine how I was doing if you came here again? Please, if possible, do it as soon as you can. We're great. It was just... It was just... It was just a time-awaiting morning, was just... 995. Or... Spirit. Because I didn't know much respect from the man. He lives in developed country. I didn't know what to say. Spectrumicure from small city, full country. Hmm? Come from the new vision. There isn't no anything about this show. There was just some letters. Sounds stupid, but sounds really nervous. to meet her again. I want to be here. I saw her. I walked to last time. And we  this shelter and we go. And I've been here social care to meet up and I've been laughing and I can do that and because I have quite a big hands, , hands on and on a small. The eagle looked  a massive, there was a baby, has laying my hands. He was taking, oh, it's bad, he was taking a big peanut, took me, so I was. No, I tried to give her a kiss and he texted that he's not taking her here. She was just  a shark boat, so it's... I was just  a shark boat. I was boys and I said I couldn't say it were. It tried. That you go or something, never say. They took me to my house and I told them all about me. I'm dying, I don't know what's happening. I was so happy. I was feeling. Since I met him, I couldn't explain it. I couldn't sleep. And I was afraid of some of the famous many girls who were going out with foreigners from only. That was a good place. And I was afraid he and rest for people could think of it. I think we went out together, I think some drinks, some bars. We were going hand-to-hand talking to each other last night. There was a call from the house and you say, you are not with me. You say, you are talking to me, you are a compro.
