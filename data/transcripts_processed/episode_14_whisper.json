And after the prime I tagged along with two couples for tempo. So you drove around, joined parties, talking and joking, singing along with radio. What am I? Who? Who? Who'd you have to pick up a friend of theirs that are house? But all the lights that are house were off, and nobody simply did home. Who's he? He's he's house. He's shh. He's shh. I think we've members of the speaker, how? You guys have been first for so long time doing the old girl. This is her new house, all right? All right. But we're now about doing documentary stories. When you're doing this kind of story, this is pretty much exactly the kind of moment that everybody's acting the way they act when there's no tape of putting them in. Tint of it. It's  hearing these people as they're really gone. Even though there is tape of quarter and a blue microphone. A cute... and a strange. And you get to this point and have to spend hours with you. Get me to you. Get the point where you actually bored. And I tell you all this, really only is a prairie to tell you this story. While back, you can just ask about small real-real tapes. Savish and I'm a first. And he took them on. And one of these tapes. exactly this quality, ,   you really do that. That is people spoke with they really talked to them, it was intimate. And it completely revealed what the people spoke about. And hearing that tape gives the idea for taste book that we're going to devote the whole show to three stories, we've got a found tape book. Excellent. Thanks. Excellent. Let's go. Back one, let's play 3dus gauge. Back two, let's 40dus gauge, both one. And back three, have this one, but here it's time. Back one. Here in Springs, just go. The tape that just lost found from 1907 came out when there was a box that was left just boxes that were to rotate the tape. In the early 60s, 70s and 80s, and it fits two hours of tape. It's not that big. It's  nine inch real tape, two hours of tape, and the box had stamp, saw over it, and it dresses written across that of it. But what it was was a letter on tape between this family and mission, the data spent. And the sign are through June. He was medical school and went on the telephone yet. And the tape is interesting because it documents pretty thoroughly by in this one, Mary. 10. Hello, sir. There's much news. Grace Bell was over one day. She was feeding Sylvan about her male situation. So I gave a Israeli therapy book. And by the way, I stamped you on, so I'm gonna be getting it in the mail soon. I had it sent right direct to you. It isn't that I think it needed, it's just a new insight on mental health. Mental illness that I think is good. I probably told you about that. The chapter I read, the jammy when I was going, we were writing to Mrs. Lester's voice and it was a chapter on, make smart-wise don't hit. and it was so interesting as I got through it. I realized halfway through it, I realized that this was written for me because I do not quite admit. And here it brought out that sometimes person may because they want to feel superior in this time they am. I mean, well here I'll read it. If you start to think about it, , perfectly well. that this sort of nagging that means nagging to that thing's darn thing isn't correct in the evil of which you can pray. It's only making you feel important, virtuous and superior. So for goodness sake, find some more constructive way in enhancing your feeling of virtue. If it's so badly needed in hand, inhale. And that is in very, very busy working in the basement, one of the machines is broken down and true to form it taking a long, long time to fix it. We're behind as usual on straps. Jack didn't goof that guess in his order of the extrusions and we are out of extrusions and won't be having them until Friday. I made $50 and won't be gonna have that when I bought a watch for soup written feed my size. I'll say goodbye. But thank you for your words. The advice is far from my resting and thank you for being concerned about my welfare. I really got along quite well recently. I did feel too bad at depression last month. Well here I go. We'll see each other again in the hot summer. I'll talk in the next slide. Oh, Joe. I  this big tape. This pretty neat arrow.

We just got back. We just got back. We suffered. , it was a couple of, we were getting a quite a show to say. It was a little pretty kissing. I was said, , oh, I think I got your gum. I got a bad cold. So, I'll be with that little pot.

You'll have a few cars or just  good things though. You got one thing. You'll have to be  the car for this. You get it. But it's probably for this. You can see anywhere that way goes. It was interesting as we visited at Nantan on Kowen, this weekend. We just had a real nice time, but I felt a little odd about going and kind of suggest to be in a very small way that I would  to call Nantan. Sometimes he gets real negative thought, and I think yes, , realize that it's because many times I pre-apped sports myself on it. I'm sitting until about 15 miles before we got there. I really felt it so, maybe should know we were coming. I should have written a code, but I left the communication, this file, and it's very, well, we got a little bit back, and jumped out of the car, not to the telephone, saying, I hope you say it as far and now. But when it came back, and then came great ice, we were coming, and we were all grateful. We made a telephone call, even though I didn't want to be. Right and say I told you so because it wouldn't have been nice to have walked in on another quarter to ten night It was Interesting how gen normally they Accepted it I don't know if I could be that gracious or not although They live such different lives. They had no plans for the weekend You mean this was fine What they had this was yet But I think of if the situation will reverse and then to when they'll drop on us. How many times we have company over the weekend, we have to go to functions and we have music lessons and things  this and our lives are so completely different. It's interesting that we just spend all day sitting without doing anything at all. And this is so unusual for us. And though I don't suppose I could do it every week. It did seem good for one week. Just to start looking at each other. (*image sounds*) When the last week, people really, very difficult for not to judge a person's Christian experience. Darling was voicing her experience last night. I was a little bit protrured because her skirt was too short. Darling was telling me, really, she was in a way, reasoned that I didn't even know it seemed to be so void of actual. feeling involved in their, I felt random. They had the smoy and they got up to run. Half my worship, I make friends with it only a weekend. And I got up half my worship. And as I did, I did a dead-eating man and sat down beside him. And I felt random funny because I really feel he does this as a dude, more than he does. And when I am my worship. But I feel communication with God and I enjoy what I'm reading. And when Daddy came in and was just, I don't know. I suppose you'd call it in the Resetman. I didn't know quite what to do. I was right in the middle of reading the chapter. So for the first time in my life, I was in the tridoo ampest of eight. What more? And his oldest, oldest, oldest, oldest, oldest, and I thought he was in the tridoo. Do you understand what you are doing? I was fine, but he didn't. So I just couldn't agree and didn't train anything. No, he sat in front of the wall and then left. I do, it was sure nice to hear from you together, right? good advice please I'm going to tell you about our feed. We got the power feed that I made. Got that. Don't know. So, I get it. I always don't live with. Put that on here, put my foot on. And we'll go to full chain of our spot. What? I think it is very beautiful, spiritual, black. And you can see the other spot to feed it. So that's the problem here. So we're going to go in and pull the chains. We're going to pull the up. Push the old out. I would love to begin to have one thing together. It has one right. We're going to get the other way. Switch for a back. Back and jump. Wait for the other side. for the trade and other direction. We said, and you have begun to enjoy many relationships. There are very, very often, I'm very, but as far as this worship is concerned, it seems as though I'm obviously one of the rest. Maybe you should get one, you say, welcome, have worship with me. Select things that are inspiring, and I think this is wrong. This new compressor works  the green, green. Yeah, of course. And history is very real happy for results for different so far. I was reading harder comments week where we so many times try to get people and do our own Panthers and do understand their background and let them stay in their, and appreciate their own pattern. Right? And we are two from clear history and we need to use our own way. Yeah, there's going to come over. We're kind of shalt get on who  him enough. He does real good at really linked all the things or things are really tough. I'm gonna strip you big old horse. So, well, I think you're a production yet, right? We're very... Because I don't really know the depth of his spirituality. It is... ...pricy. ...meets. This is a practically fool-proof flow. We don't put too much effort on it. Or so. because I have no way of not I'm going to stop worrying. It's really stupid. It's stupid. It's a pretty good. Daddy's calm. So bye bye son. I just had to tell you son daddy screamed and how are you never heard him over the tape. I was right in middle of a sentence to you. So I didn't go. But when I ran down here he has his power. He's on  that. He's very, very. He's very. So what he does and everyone has got lost if he had granted because they tried so hard to be patient. They, by day they hope they can get to a fixed piece. So now I find this morning that he takes the arm that is working every state here and the working this. And this is the disease that he is to be in the course of the most usual. And that he was so tickled. He was just tickled with a little boy. So, son, we love you. We'll sing you. I want to say you some more fear for your leg now. Good night. Hello, son. How do you want to start? So, son, we love you. We'll sing you. I want to say you some more fear for your leg now. Good night. Good night. If I had the money I would have called you tonight, it's funny when you have an emotional problem, you don't quite know where to turn. They can say to you and they're in the Lord and I think this is true. And yet we're so human, we want him to help. I just come back from taking you walk. They saved me thinking you might just talk with someone. And of course, you don't talk to problems out with community people. And so I decided I'd run deep. recorder on. You can hear negative 20 years cold. You did hear in the negative side of the Davis household. She's been hit for the last few years. Here's the, now 90s going on now. But I are, this week is really dinner week. Tell you, but with my face, I'm waiting for this tears off her face. I told you that I would  to. Yes, because I'm not. David, how would you find some knowledge? That was the study that you see at all that I did. You all can fit me. There's no excuse for this. Really, I didn't think of the first time she came on my own. It's a little thing that she's bought. It seems great to just have one in spirit. And at the first of the years, you'd probably been worked by as much as you should have. Regardless of what's going over the VM, she's left at 500.0 now. Well, naturally we've got the problem bebany. Just to talk to the staff about it, said he's able to do a lot of things. Anything. Just to be no understand at all. That's the truth. That's it. Thank you. But when going home this out from Mrs. Here she came over crying now and while I was teaching music lessons I went up and found out What the problem was naturally she realizes her mistakes and she could see that she didn't know which way to turn And I explained this to her by a snipe and she realized that she made mistakes but goodness knows how many mistakes we've made in life And this parent simply just helped me pick up the pieces and somehow put them together again so she wouldn't feel defeated this would be. Also, much more rewarding. But I also told them that I felt that we had really helped you to open too much with your school and that it seemed to me and I'm sure you children felt the same way that there were hundreds of dollars that caused this basement and I did believe you think it right? She was in a very much I love said she probably helped her and we all know that I don't know where I am and we all know the situation is not but I feel in the way that she sort of had this coming because she has wanted a full time with this last month she has picked up to her parents she's 2 plus 4 lead and then it's easier for him. Ah, oh, that five six hours. What course was accomplished? And then what he should ask is, he's been spent with his medals. And then we can talk, talk, and he's been much better. I sort of feel it's better, probably the way for children who are in their education or who needs to actually give money and decide we go have money. So we're working on the base back. work. There would be any money in more of theirs right now. The fact there would be as much, so I don't... I just  it makes up my philosophy, my thinking, so I know Dari's representative to connect it, needle, give it more money. She sees all these other folks getting money and she does. I don't know exactly what to do about the situation. Of course we knew right, which one. But yeah, right now I'm pretty strapped in all the packs I've spent, and they bought her a dollar bill. But at the moment, now I'll go from here again. Okay, number one, stay at all the two hundred. Just a minute. Back in, Dad just keeps talking for a few minutes. I didn't know if I was going to work for him this number or not. I'm a little late here, but I guess I'm going to work at the school. The afternoon's there because I have the other dad just to sit and thank you. Well, anyway, be that way, rich talk story. No, blah, blah. Well, there's things running downstairs, they're , they're cooking. , totally look at my little grill mouth with it. One side of the oven. Kind of same side in corn field, maybe. Little boy mouth with it. The other side of the oven, one day it's a little grill mouth. They ought to make a trip across the oven. And once you got little boys, how's she said? Hell, hell, why have been read? They're reading the corn. that the older part is wrapped with wood, which cut the wire what's you got here motion cut the worst gotchie cut the cord cut to the 短ADA actually open The ... Let's click Anyway That, , it really made it quite funny. And I even spent it funny as ever. And I'm gonna click your notes again. It's a big hole, drill. Downstairs. Nice music, man. I have more music for so many months. I don't know where to be, still. I'm gonna go back. So, , well anyway. So, what? that it's really been nice to talk to you and I want to leave you with one really profound statement. What are you drawing these cats right over there yet? I want you to be sure if you don't feel great. You're with them for that. So all of a sudden we love you, Lucy. This is a man! This is a man! But it would be the same!

We'll see you in the next one. Well, we speak of our video staff, did a few days of detective work and tracked down the dates now. Now, this takes the son medical school in the late 1960s. And we reached the former medical student, Arthur Davis Jr. is home in India, California, not far from Palm Springs. The practice is family business. He actually makes house calls to sit and has... six kids' visit. And he told us that these letters on tape went back and forth between me and his parents for a period of that four years. He said no, he hadn't heard once since the 19th. He said no, he had no idea how one could end up in a thrift storage saga. No, he said his parents were not still alive. He's not a doctor, he's a father that could. We said no, but uncut tape said no, so it said it's fine. he said the tapes captured the analysis. The trauma of a lot of American families, emotional distance of father's death, where family orbit, father and aunt, father, and father's heart. And, after the day of the funeral, he said, his father is  a lot of men. And wasn't pretty good. He came up to this rare event before. and there was a lot of bitterness and so it was pretty tough for him. He even considered getting married and then when I was born, my mom said that he just broke his ears. , thinking that he might have to deal with those issues, that the parent never did what he wanted to be. She really helped him through that part. what was very fascinating, I was. after my mom died, my dad changed her business. And he came to work with me and quite a bit of time with Mr. Lee and he was very connected with us in the trip. That all seems right. The private dates, Jr. coming up, tomorrow tapes, tomorrow that pops. In a minute, I'm pretty interested. But it's American life, my regards. YouTube and program course which is theme. And many variety of writers from this to tackle that theme. With radio monologues, reaching work pudding, memoirs, short fiction, anything they can think of. Today's program. Accidental documentaries. Stories made from old tapes that have been sitting in basements and addicts and thrift stores for decades. We have arrived at two of our program.

Three years before I was born, he's 23 years old. And coming up right now, a musical, a wonderful. the quietness of Norman On the Choke, just for the home because as we said before.

Right now they are featuring the new 1957 frigid air, Phil Prumat electric drive, at an unbelievable low price. And my father started in radio when he was 19. The same age I was one. started. He began at the College Station for the University of Maryland and after graduation, cut a job spinning records at a commercial station called Tumon. Then he was drafted and at time of this particular recording my thought was actually an army station to Virginia. But he wanted to career in radio so badly that every Sunday morning at the break of dawn, he would leave his wife and his five-month-old baby all of a sudden.

I was thinking that on campus. You're a good announcer. I didn't really know that. I've been listening to the way that you do the lesson.

Not long after he got out of the army, my dad decided that radio was no way to make living. And after a series of jobs he decided to become the certified public accountant. He was a typical workaholic suburban dad, , after the office of the seven morning, back at six thirty dinner, exhausted after that, he was the yellow kind of front to be with the assembly. started to have business, struggled to establish it, worked out some nights at weekends. During tax season, from January to April 15th, we would go with... You see, it's been a radio, radio. In our house when I was growing up, there was an old real-der-reout temper quarter, little consumer unit. That my mother and my sisters and I would do for a while, at the time, in the time, in the court of singing and the stories. appears in these tapes a lot. My father does not hear him once. He simply was not there to record it. The only time he's mentioned all of these tapes this is my mother is feeling to my older sister. Where's the arms? Very smart dad. Daddy goodbye. Did you go at home? Go back home? In the car? Go back home? Oh, man. These days, my dad experiences decision to leave radio and become accountant this way. By that time, I realized that radio was not for me. What happened? The end of the program. The ramp director would come in, the apple of that guy's eye, then he would be around the job. I was going to start with job again, even though that never happens to me. And I could say it would happen to another peep. I wanted to be in full of my own destiny. I decided that it was not me. And that was not me. And that was 19. Yeah, the year I was born. There are those two things related. Not it off. It says  they are. No, no, no. Well, all the stars were unmetted and all the record stars. There's a Sunday morning carousel coming up for you right now, our featured top team of the day. Number one in the record store is revisit this week in Baltimore, and definitely buy your guys and letters you have read. It ranks very high. The Prince of Wales and self-worn John Wale is just walking in the rain. At the Waste Street  this usually ends. is that I reveal that this is why I'm in radio to make little much others  to see, to live the dream that he never got to wave. But I have to say the fact is, I never knew him as a radio DJ. I did not know that he had ever done radio, the entire time I grew up, it was never discussed. The recordings of him doing this stuff were packed away in the basement, nobody talked about it. I never thought of him as somebody who did anything. But certified public counting. If my mom ever mentioned this, I do not remember it. And I certainly didn't grow up with any special feeling about radio. I could care less about radio. most Americans, my medium of choice was television. I come my first job with national public radio in Washington. When I was a 19 years old. And I thought when I simply wanted a job in the need. idea. If an ad agency, I was a flick freshman in college. If an ad agency had hired me that summer right now, I would probably be doing burglary commercials. , I can just see the whole thing laying out that way. And in 1978, when I started working at NPR, my parents absolutely did not want me to do it. They wasn't even  a judgment call. They were completely against it for the next. I want to say 10 years. maybe it was 15 years. I mean they simply saw it,  the most parents were, they saw this practical, they worried that I would never make any money, never be able to support a family. Essentially the reasons that my father put great. When I first dug out these tapes of my father about a year ago, I asked my dad, , if he ever wish it's still due radio. And he was completely unintesistive about the idea. In all my life, I had only seen his desire to be on the radio once. And this was actually a couple years ago. I was filling in as guest host of Talk of Nation. This is a daily college show and here does have Washington as soon as we're here. And my father had never seen me host a radio show. And here my mom drove. to watch me do the show and before the show, he asked me if he could read the news. And the first thing he was joking, I don't remember exactly what I said about his joke, something  that. And then later he got closer to going on the air. He asked him, , that he would  to read the newscast, the MPR newscast, top of the hour getting the show. And I agree with you serious. and I had to respond to him that I didn't have any authority at that. That the MQR newscasts, they broke the rotten newspaper to live with themselves. Anyway, finally, less fought. You got a chance to announce on the air again. I had him tell how the star father's day. The addition of the smart guy. Then a few months after that, can I were talking about what he's going to do after he tires still work. still works long long hours. And he told me he's been thinking about how I do the little reader work again. After he retires, that is if you can find some radio station or some radio program that uses some wine. and then predict big things for a new record. Our feature top tune of tomorrow. Here's a guy we feel pretty safe in predicting big things for his name is Nat King Cole. Our feature top tune of tomorrow? My personal possession. You are my personal possession.

Obsession You're my first new conception That's what you love Act 3 Chicago Norma Reina now joins us This is some records and tapes I'm sorry This is an old 40 pie It's my father He was a pioneer in Spanish language Broadcast in Chicago A radio mouse in the 1950s and successes. My dad's not playing the guitar or singing of the song. He's deciding poetry. This is what he sounded  when I was a little. I knew that. Were you good, Marshall? It is very beautiful. For what we? For me? Yes. be born and last. I need honest reach. Or be, recognise, what isogn, what is beyond it? Be, only shown, no. Get to me. Yes, you mustn't. Lighten your thoughts, light down our content to the right mind, both over and over an oppressed mind, scatter goodbyewards This is the truth, this may my mother fall in love with him. it was upon called his brim these grinding about. He his turscene the nerberryer. Yeah There This is really This is very It's pretty It's fine it's nice 超 It's nice Important here and fascists and others and turn into an genre within the world. Poisoning, deeds, insects, there was a soldier who was there, they were a me and and there is another guy. They were doing this toast. The best one, the best part was when he's poemio. The toast is for the mother. The one who carried him nine months. The one who arrived within two In a few minutes Gloving dead. I know what my mother was thinking when she heard this. And in man who didn't get so worked up about his mother had to be a special meaning. So she called the radio station. They talked on the telephone, went out, until months later. Now, calling in love with the voice on the radio may sound extreme but in... consider this. My mother was 16 and Chicago for only a few months after having lived in Puerto Rico. In this first time in the States, she barely spoke English and mostly stayed home. She was sleeping with the girls often and windows and kept hearing. I want to learn more. Let's learn. So. To learn. To find. To find. To find. To find. To find. To find. I'm more than an athlete. and is , let's just say it's very romantic about the perfection of a woman's eyes. And this man, the one here, never knew him. Sure, I heard stories about his way of vision. How do you produce talent shares and have life performance and bring in clouds more of the city? People would come to the part of live radio when he wanted to hear him. In this part, the time I was old enough to hear me radio. who was reading the news in that pouch. But what I remember, it suffice to me and not me father, about how he was never home always lived to visit the house. His life on the radio was all consumed in there and in the part my parents did have a drug-been part. And I had fights with him too, while I was on a 16-year-old dad feed home after being away, in ten days. My answer wasn't this working. He wasn't as if he was out of town. He just didn't come home. Well, he didn't push that very intent to be. Partly, he was defensive because he was saying an up woman, partly because he did this cult class. I was talking to him  an American girl, but he was Mexican. I mean, Spanish families, you never questioned your father. You never questioned me. And his mind. There is nothing more disrespect for the entire questioning of the word you can talk. When my mother found out about the other woman she couldn't believe it, and didn't, he would tell her in that same uniformness and he still got to persuade it, that she was mad in the past ten months ago, that there was no one else, and could never be any of this I wouldn't apologize, but I would shout, talk to God! He wouldn't scold, and go to sleep? I made after another one of them in fights after months of continuous movement, my mother took a minute in the shop, my father. Me. My dance survived the gunshot, and me's pain. He lied to them about what had happened, so they didn't take my mother in jail. He told them that. He was teaching her to shoot when he gunned off. The cops didn't even leave me. But he didn't want to face charges in basically the news you can do. The strange thing in the front-while at whole experience part includes the gift. From life. He's the person who's a better person. Oh, what do you do? That's the only thing I've ever seen. A couple of years ago, I decided to meet my son over in Mexico. We were going to celebrate Father's Day. We don't know why we picked Father's Day and both understood that being a father wasn't something he did very well. I want to think about it now, I keep remembering the time in my life when I was he was empty. The point is, they didn't show up. I think it's going to be sad because what I ended up doing is so much fun tonight. and he got a new joy to say too. I went to visit my ongoing cousins in Mexico City and told stories beside poetry we talked a lot about my dad. My cousin even brought out his guitar and tried to recite some of the poems and their dad used to read. Svah! Svah! Svah! Svah! Svah! Svah! Svah! Svah! He's a friend who's a sister of the point of the show. It was typical for my dad not to seem looked up to use that included the family. Now that he's not really hard, he's losing one of it. No, he's losing his taxes. Oh, yeah. He's been out of radio for almost two years. When I talk to him on Monday, next I'm Badly Spock. I have a picture of my dad on the stage, in the back of the Spanish dance from Big Dance Rounding. There's a woman sharing the stage with me. She elegant and stunning. She has this long, slowing evening. She captures me from the bowing of the waves. She holds out a hand to hand in the class of the stage and kisses me. A little bit else, there is a moment when silently I touch a certain console. You don't want to leave? Or   amusos. Or   . He also put a little bit of a normal arena works for the park district here in Chicago. No, at the end of the story, but you're dead and you're just especially to get this one deco or song called L-Ray. The key. Explain this to the evidence of the song. Well, it's my dad's favorite song. And he's trying to sort of took it on his theme for his life. Oh, you can't tell us why this would be his book. Well, it talks about a man who has no place and regardless of where he finds himself, he continues to be the key. I know very well that I'm outside, but the day that I die, I know you will have to cry. Cry cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry. You will say that you never loved me, but you will be very sad. and we'll be that way forever. With money or without money, I always do what I want. And my word is the one that I don't know the right. I have no throne or queen for anyone who understands me. You'll see what's in the right. But I continue. to be the king. Hey, Siddharth! Why are you going to go so fast? Call the coconut, and then I'll stop this place on. Hey, hey! Have you actually heard him sing this song? Oh, yes. Really? He's sang this at parties. Family gatherings. He's warning me. He's sang this song. No, that's not it. No, that's not it. No, that's not it. No, that's not it. This was a beautiful, better, it is the guy. The song is clearly, . He knows it's not really the king knows he's not Well actually I rather it's not really true. I think that what what's true or is that you really thinks He's king no, yes, he's a tribute to the way he lived his life His way , Frank Sinatra He's funny you said that I was just about to say this is the Spanish my way our program was produced today by at least people in myself with Nancy Updack Peter Crown 8 for us while we're in Joey Snider, the center of the Paul Tufts and Henry's Jack-Hate Parky Rock on a close series so how?
