  "text": "When I picked up the phone, it was a man and it had been met a month. It was the three-tonked, which is not unusual. And certainly my fault. Anyway, my mom said that she had been invited to speak with a group of women at the local Gossal. My mom said that there were tests in the Jewish suburbs. That's why I bought one. And these are Gossal women. Group, the Matt Bringer. Other women in the red corner. early 60s. And when the group first started meeting, they apparently discussed all sorts. It was wide range. But as time progressed, they realized there was only one talk they wanted to talk about. If I  the needed to talk about, laughter. They thought traumatized up. And that was there. relationships with adult children. And at some point this became the only thing that the group talked about. It's official reason for being. And they invited my mother to be the discussion about how to get along with your adult children. So my mom is a big, per-per-per-per, which is invited to talk on various psychological topics. She looks at particles, experts, talks to people. And it's part of her. preparation my mom decided to call her own three adult children to see what advice they would give to the group about communicating with your adult children, about having a good relationship with your adult children. So my mom had already talked to my older sister Randy out in California by the time she called me, your Chicago. In the explained Randy is saying that communicating with your adult children and because your adult children. She asked Mr. Guadalupe what if I she would give to the crib? Pain is advice was direct and to the clip. She said, tell them to get a different leader. I doubt children, supposedly adult children. And there's supposedly adult pants in the... this edition of this American life from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International of our GOS back for another week documenting everyday stories in the United States. Today, act one, me and my mom, act two, sentencing law in their father, back to me, sentencing law, father, and his maelder Chinese wives. See you with us. So in this conversation with my mom, that was in the unusual position of being able to look  a good child in the family for a change. My older sister for a change was  the bad kid. And I was able to sit in my mom, , even if Randy thought that you weren't handling your relationship with us in the very best way, surely there was a way that we expressed that it was up. a little as cruel. And my mommy asked me, okay, so what advice would it have for this group? And I suggested that in the families of a lot of my friends, and I think in my family, I thought that one cause of a lot of tension is the fact that as a family, you don't have a story that we agree on about the past. Kids, my sisters and I, we have one version of what happened when we were children. Never. it doesn't become a dark actually. Not completely, but there's a lot of dark instead of. And our parents have put it in a different story. And  I don't even think we need to come to a consensus. I don't think families need to agree about this stuff. I'm not even sure if they can agree. But I think there has to be some kind of mutual understanding that each side sees the past, the way that they see it. Today's part. will not be in attempt to find this common story. But it will be an attempt to define that gap, as it exists in a few families. How a day-season is just ending and for so many people, the drama of holidays is the drama of parents and grown children struggling to get along without disappointing each other, forgetting each other's nerves. So, do you begin our program right now? I am pleased to welcome to our show, telephonicly spot more. My mom. Can I say something? I was just going to say, feel free to amend or correct. Yes, I, when I, when I told your sister what he said, she said, oh, I was just kidding. I didn't need to be mean. Oh, so I don't want to hurt her. I started being less than the... All right, then you're a professional psychologist. Now don't you think often? Don't you think there was a note of hostility and what she said? Oh, absolutely. Okay, there you see. And you and I can agree. And frankly, she's not on the phone. And... And somehow, the thing I wanted to ask you about is, okay, so you had this seminar with all these... What's in a seminar with the discussion group? The discussion group. And I was the facilitator. And how many women was it? Ram 30, so. Oh, so, huh? Mm-hmm. Now if you had to characterize and phrase people's relationships with your children, when you describe them as being very good, somewhat okay, generally kind of yucky, and then how would you describe? I would say that there were a lot of... people who's dreams haven't been realized, his expectations haven't been met, and so there's a sense of disappointment, although there were some people there who were pleased with all aspects, and then of course the question was, why are you here? To go out was that the answer to go out and show you pictures of grandchildren? A little bit. A little bit. Okay. But we're taking that with the other women I suppose. But these are the criteria for satisfaction doing. here though. Quickly. Whether they're children were married. Yes. So that having single children was a disappointment. I'm just going to go to checklist here. Whether they're children was closed by or far away. And I'm shooting zero-produce of our key guy. All right. Whether their children appreciated them. Okay. Whether they had grandchildren. Whether they had grandchildren somebody now. So there were one of their children was pregnant with the first grandchild. Okay. Let me start your prayer and let me begin, alright? Over there. Sure. Hold your hand. Now. Go. Five. Seven. Three? Five? Four? They're nine. And then on. Six? From now on. Count. when they collapsed, , so that's the epitome. Whether their children were successful in their lives, how much they liked their child spouse, and got along with them? You tell me on the phone earlier, it's a big interesting one. Yes, I told you that there were several people there who did not  their child's choice of a partner at the time they got married but had grown to love them. very much and in some cases even  the better than the ranch child. See, now I wonder if that is because there is an inherent tension between children and their adult parents that the child sometimes wants to be treated as the child and sometimes wants to be treated as an end in the dog and for the parent it's pretty much hellish guessing. And then yeah. Yeah, a lot of people talked about walking on eggshells and how can I several people say, well, how? What's the right way to give advice? And, of course the answer is, you don't give advice unless somebody asks you for it. Do you think that this relationship is harder than relationship between adult children and their parents? Is harder on the parents than on the children? Yes, because the parents have a dream of how they thought it was going to be and it felt a match is the dream. , one person said that the her children are all single all this far away and she's a cheat. The channel husband is very lonely. What's happened is that they've got much closer to each other because they realize that they're all that they have. Right. Well, Dr. Glass, I'm afraid that this would be about all the time you have this particular segment of our radio show. Welcome, Glia, for any time. I can get with my children. Alright, T-Shade.

I insist that this be the last radio commentary about my father. Okay. Maybe I've never talked about him on the radio before. I just don't want this to become a habit. Sanctuary Singles is a writer, composer, he and his dad. columnist, the Buzz magazine, Los Angeles, and why are you going to bring your two stories from her about her father today about how the adult children and her family deal with her father? This story began as a column in Buzz magazine. It also appears in Sandra's book, depth takes a holiday. At one point, she and I adapted it for radio and a shortened version of this story, ran an empire's morning edition. Here's the whole story. Understand that for years stories about my father and a goat. that I thought were throwaways were the only thing anyone would ever remember about me. The right-standard parties, one hip jutted out, trying to tell amusing, hit compelling stories about myself. At which point the dark-eyed man I was speaking with with Lean Forward, best to hand lightly on my arm and murmur. , I've been wondering for years. Yes, my dream. A flame would leave into his eyes. How is your dad? Does he still wear his underwear? backwards and do the Chinese snake dance on Pacifico's highway? I close my eyes and pain. No. Of course not. Well, yes. First, let's take a step backwards. Forget my dad. Immigrant parents in general tend towards eccentricity, don't they? They arrive from the old country. Now they have VCRs and queues and arts. Their children are going up to be monsters and worse. The local Ralph stops carrying pig knuckles. For the record my father does not wear his under. where backwards, only his sweater. When the elbows were through, you just turn them around and keep going. And yes, for the record, he did perform the Chinese snake dance for us kids, naked, armed only with a fluttering beach towel as he leapt and twirled, imparting his ancient Chinese folks on with a mournful how. I know this may sound strange, but I've brought my father into the studio today to sing it. Papa? This is called Chinese. means snakes are actually involved from old Chinese shepherds. It sounds  this. Tiansam desu wa shamo ren  I, Dishati wang hau shamo ren  I. Dad's lived in Malibu for some 30 years now threatening to cause property values to tumble along with him. I'm going to tell the story now and the way I tell it so I hope you're not embarrassed. Okay. Oh, dear, what do I have? What? What? What's the name of her called the police to complain? My father was hanging out his old underpants to dry Shanghai style, unclosed line and strung out in front of the garage. The end. pants had holes in them. The complaint calls eventually stopped. But question for me. Does my father or retired aerospace engineer with science degrees from Stanford, Purdue and Cal Tech have to wear old underpants with holes in them? Is this a person who can afford say new underpants and a make tag dryer perhaps? Why yes, would have to be the answer. My father is one of those people. who have untold stocks, bonds, mutual funds, iris, whatever that they are continually shifting from one account to the net. For all his money though, my father has always transported himself in and out of Malibu via hitchhiking. Yes, he owns his own car, he even bought me one, a Hyundai, he had a shelter income. But he doesn't  to drive. Say why. Or because the pollution also the petromer is there, only 50 years. So... We have to save this for the next next generation. But you particularly  hitchhiking. But you try to meet our speed force. Mm-hmm, especially in Los Angeles. Now, beloved listeners, this is my commentary. So I'm going to try and give you my point of view, what I see. Usually I'm driving through Santa Monica, and I'll come by, , let's say the corner will sure and forth. And there, my father will be standing, clutching his lucky grocery bag, the scientific papers. trying to flag down a ride. I'll never not pick him up. That would be a little too how sharp the serpents tooth. But I have been tempted to just put my foot on the gas pedal and race towards the Pacific happy and free. somebody who's 75-year-old dead is not still copying rides from the public. Okay, this is your section. Okay. Let's talk about the day you got the really good ride and where were you standing? This I always get good ride. But that was the sp- special girl right. I just come from dentists office late after the new at on Wishibara New Western and the first class stopped a very gracious lady looked Rory Ta-Yam she told her look  who? Rory Ta-Yam you don't know because very old movie star very gracious lady. Rory Ta-Yam oh  a Chinese movie star. knows am I can get noises the sonrwatya Yeah, I'm sorry. Lori, tie, yeah, okay. Loreta, yeah, I'm sorry. Loreta, yeah, okay. I see very gracious. I mean, we don't know hesitation. Let me in the back seat of her photo Mercedes-Benz because in the front seat, the passenger seat will be occupied by a young man. So then we talk about different things. I say, what kind of business do you people eat? Is there a movie business? Mercedes-Benz, that's exciting. Did you you said she had known a lot about Chinese opera and film? Oh yes, we discussed many Chinese movies so she knows that I love And then somehow we talked about printed and the lady said yeah, I  the boys Hillary and the bear we were in the White House recently. Then I said what's your name? She said, can she be a guest? I said, wow, I don't go movies, I don't know much movie stuff. But I do know Houston family because your father John Houston past few years away I have a kept the track on your family story. No that's a important point for my father because unlike Ms Houston I didn't go into my father's business science and it's been a little disappointing. But she gave you a letter right? I asked her can you give me your autograph? For finally she turned it emerald a bag If you're saying  this 2 Mr. Low, it was a pleasure to have you in my car. They're hot with two wings. They love and you let their Houston. They don't their XXXX. Being Chinese, I don't know what the XXX name, they later asked my friend, they say, that's kissing kissing. No. Okay, so there's a story. Here's the way I remember my dad first telling me and ending this. I remember you said this. While Angelica Houston was a good ride, she was in the dream ride. Because she had a friend, this friend to drop off in Beverly Hills, which took you a lot of your way. And that point would have been quicker for you to take the cross town bus because you had a transfer. But by then, I remember you lowered your voice. You're an expert in such delicate matters of decorum. And you said that you thought at that point getting out might be a little rude. Ka-pa. Why don't you just take us out with a song? Another song? Yeah. This song you , I see me, whatever my wife says today, Sandra didn't invite my wife, I have to strain the kids, stay in the kitchen, the home. This song describes them a young woman, longing for her love. Something  this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok, alright. Sanjutsenglo and her father in Los Angeles. His music by the way is also by Sandra, which is her closest and her closest of her album, piano vision. They played this music sometimes a morning edition. You can hear this after the little news breaks. Sometimes you can hear this little piano riffs. This record. Anyway, we're parents and adult children come up.

Coming up, Sandra Tsingo, her father, and his new man, you may have a... and the Chinese Tribes, its in a minute, Public Radio International we not require a p/. This American life of my regardless, each week of course on our program we invite a variety of writers and performers to tackle something that we choose our theme today. Our theme today is families in which the parents and the children see the story of their family in radically different ways. And rather than have a hobby bunch of different kinds of forms. actually we only have one performer in the show today, Sandra low. And we arrived at Act 3 of our program. This is a story called My Father's Chinese Wives. San Juan has performed this a lot around Los Angeles and most recently in New York City. In a show called Amelians in America. My father has decided at age 70 to take a Chinese wife. He has written his family in Shanghai, seeking their help in locating likely candidates. His good confidence in this project, he's hoping to be married in six months. Let's and peel this news one layer at a time. Question. Is my father even what one would consider marriageable at this point? At age 70, my father, a retired Chinese aerospace engineer, is starting to look more and more  somebody's gardener. His feet shuffle along the patio and their broken sandals. He's still so polite one or two stray weeds. coughing fligmatically. Later, he sits in a pretend chair and eats leathery green vegetables and brown sauce, his old eyes slitted weirling. It times he almost seems to be overacting this lizard-y old part. He milks it. I am old now, I'll say with a certain studied pointy-in. I am just your crazy old Chinese fond. If he's at all, why does he still do the same vigorous daily exercise regime he's done for the past 10 years? 45 minutes of pull-ups, something that looks  the twist and much unfocused bellowing. This always performed on the most public beaches possible in his favorite speedo when he found in a dumpster. No, crazy old Chinese father is in truth, a code word, a rationalization for the fact that my father has always had a hard time spending money. My biological briefcase to take to work when an empty frosted flakes cereal box will just as well. Paper slipped on neatly inside, pens can be clipped conveniently on either end. Why by bounty paper towels, when at work you can just walk down the hall to the washer, open the dispenser, and lift out a stack. They're free. You can bring home as many as we want. If you've worn the same sweater for so many years at the elbows, wear out, turn it around, get another decade out of it, wear it backwards. Which is why to this day, my father wears only crew neck. Vneck sweaters. Terrific is my older sister, Caitlyn's response when I fell in her with the news. Bear in mind that Caitlyn is not seen my father since the mid-80s, preferring to nurse her bad memories of him independently via a therapist. She allows herself a laugh, laying a cider-custymary dull hostility, for a moment of more Dracula hostility. So who does he think would want to marry him? someone Chinese I answer. Oh good, she exclaims, that narrows down the field to what? Half a billion? No, as usual, he's doing this to punish us. Think about it. She continues with her usual, chilling logic. He marries a German woman the first time around. It's a disaster. You and I symbolize that because he's passive aggressive and he's cheap. But no, to him, it's that rebellious. that's the problem. You take an Asian immigrant just off the boat, for example. Here is a woman fleeing a life of oppression under a communist government to know public sanitation and working in a bicycle factory for ten cents an hour and repeated floggies every hour on the hour, every day of every week of every month of every year. After that, living with our father might seem  just another bizarre incident of some kind. It could happen. Caitlin scores some comp... points, but nonetheless, I'm bothered for a different reason. Because in describing the potential new wife, he has used only that one adjective. Chinese. He has not said, I'm looking for a smart wife, or even a fat wife. He has picked Chinese. That word is meant to stand for so much. Asian. Asian women. Young Asian ladies. It is a month later and, as if in a dream, I sit at the warn for my family dining on table with my father, photos and letters spread out before us. Since my father has written to Shanghai, the mail has come pouring in. I have to face the fact. that my father is well hot. You see, he says, seven women have written, ha! He beams his gold, Mueller glinting. He drinks steaming green tea from a chip laboratory beaker, which he handles with a beauty in the beast pot holder. Remarkably, my father doesn't make the least effort to mask his delight, no matter how inappropriate. He is old now. He can do whatever the alley wants is how I now understand it. With a sigh I turn to the f- and in spite of myself, I am loud. Sao Pa, Ling Ling, Siu Pa, 28th Administrative Assistant, 47th Owner of a Seen Stress Business, 39th, freelance beautician, the words jump off the pages both in English and Chinese translations. These women are dynamos, achievers, with curly black hair, in turtle necks, jointly writing bicycles, seated squarely on cannons before military museums. Standing proudly with three. full-grown daughters. One thing unites them, they're already to leap off the mainland at the drop of a hat. And don't think their careers in hobbies are going to keep them from being terrific wives. Quite the opposite. Several already have excellent experience, including one who's been married twice already. The seamstress has sent him shorts and several pairs of socks. There's much talk of seven course meals and ironing and terrific expertise in gardening. Super achievement is a major theme that applies to all. But the biggest star of all, of course, is my father. He clears his throat and gleefully reads from a letter by one Lue Sun. It reads, Dr. Lowe, your family has told me of your excellent scientific genius in your many awards. I respect academic scholarship very highly and would be honored to meet you on your next visit. You see my father Chuckles. They have a lot of respect. me in China, when I go there, they treat me  President Bush, free drinks, free meals. I do not pay for anything.\" He had his chance. He got married once for 25 years. He was a terrible husband and a worse father. Itlin is weighing in. All jokes are off. Her fury blazes away. further aggravated by the fact that she is going through a divorce and hates her $50,000 a year job. Her monthly Nordstrom bills are astronomical. MCI is positively crackling. He's a single man, I say. Mom's been gone for 12 years now. And now he gets a second try, just  that, Caitlin exclaims, Clean slate, start right over, by a wife, it makes me sick. He's totally unqualified to sustain a marriage. A family. structure of any kind collapses around him. Do you even remember one happy Christmas? Twinkling lights in tin saw suddenly swirl before me and looking deeper through green foliage. I see my mother looking beautiful and crisp and lipstick in pearls. Her wavy, Auburn hair done. Except for the fact that she is hysterical and my father, his face a mask of disgust, so extreme it is almost parodic, his holding his overpriced new V-neck tennis sweater gamelvia pearls rarely don't share her hair in fast bar, but they do feel unannuckled in style�히筷 got Starts too shy, Oh yeah, simple but just kinda im Starbucks, it's actually the opposite look is completely alright though. I really really didn't have that much left out to learn about these, and sex out in front of him he was a dead animal. I try to block it out, is what I say. Well, I was six years older than you, so I can't. Caitlin's pain is wrong. Why does he deserve to be happy now? He made mama miserable all her lifetime. He was so cheap. I think she was almost glad to go as soon as she did. A $70 dress leaving the heater on overnight, too much spent on a nice steak dinner. He could never let anything go. He could never just let it go. He just could not let things go. Meanwhile, on its own gentle time clock, unsullied by the raging deaths of his two daughters, I found this project burst into flower. And 47-year-old Lou, the writer of the Magic Letter, is the lucky winner. Within three months, she's flown to Los Angeles. And my father are married a week later. I do not get to meet her right away, but my father fills me in on the stats. And I have to confess, I'm surprised at how urban she is. How modern. Lou is a divorcee with, well, ambitions in the entertainment business. Although she speaks no English, she seems to be an expert on American culture. In fact, that Los Angeles's near Hollywood has not escaped her. This is made clear to me once Sunday evening, three weeks later, via telephone. I know you have friends in the entertainment business, my father declares, he has never fully grasped the fact that I am a typist, and that swans in his films clients include such Oscar contenders as craft foods and motorola. Aside from having knitted me a sweater and playing the piano, my father continues, you should know that Lou is an excellent singer. Turning away from the film, he is new wife exchange a series of staccata reports in Mandarin, which means nothing to me. I'm sure Lewis quite accomplished, I reply. It's just that, oh, she is terrific! My father exclaims, shocked that I could be calling Lewis Musical Talent into question. You want to hear her sing? Here, here, I will put her on the phone right now! Creeping into my father's voice is a tremulous tone that's sickeningly familiar. How many times had I heard it during my childhood as I was pushed towards the piano, kicking in the screen, how many times? But that was 20 years ago. I gulp a tear or back down. I live my own apartment now full of directors, chairs, poted fikuses, and Matisse posters. I will be fine. My father has moved on to a totally new pushy. He picks up the phone. There's a throat. Then burst out triumphantly. You are just aYeah me... Give a No. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I have left you, Dr. Low, and taken the Toyota. So there. Five weeks later, Luges packs or suitcase. And which is, and takes off in the family toy. Yoda. She leaves her note on the same for Micah, family dining room table, which she'd first won my father's heart. My father is in shock. Then again, he's spiela softened. That loop, she was bad on what? She says I do not  to give her gifts. She says I do not  to go out and I and it is true. I do not, but I say go, see your friends to try and tell you it is okay with me. I  it better with me. she leaves the house sometimes it is more quiet. But Luke does not want to take the bus. She wants to drive the car. But  me. I am your crazy old Chinese father. I do not  to pay for her offer insurance. And then he actually said, as with many Asians, he is a very bad driver. Ha! His Caitlin's only comment. Isn't it interesting? how he seems to repel even his own kind. Summer turns to fall in Southern California, causing the palm trees to sway a bit. The divorce is soon final, lose settlement including $10,000 in microwave in the Toyota. For once well, my father has picked out a new bride. Shoo ping. 30. 7. Homemaker from the Kwong Shui Province. I grow. But no, Shu Ping is very good. My father insists he has had several phone conversations with her. And she comes very highly recommended. Not. I have to say  Lou. She was bad that what? Shu Ping is very sensible and hard working. She has had a tough life. Boy. She worked in a coal mine in Manchurian until she was 25. years old. The winters there were every, every bit she had to make her own shoes and clothing. Then she worked on a farming collective where she raised cattle and grew many different kinds of crops by herself. I'm sure she's going to fit in really well and Los Angeles, I said. Creepvingtem Ca Chooping indeed is a different genre. the news to my astonishment comes from Caitlyn. I received her voice trailed off the very word seeming to allude her. A burst tanker from Papa and shoe pink. My sister continues in a kind of trance of matter of factness as if describing some curious archeological artifact. On the cover there is a clown holding balloons. It's from Hallmark. Insan. and gold lettering cursive, it reads, happy birthday. Love. Shoe ping. And your daddy. Your what? I think Shoe ping put him up to this. The envelope is not addressed in his handwriting. Nonetheless, Caitlin thinks it over. Can curse with herself. Yes. Yes. I believe this is the first birthday card I've ever received from him in my life. That's it. First, it's totally bizarre. A week later, Caitlin receives birthday gifts in the mail, a sweater hand knit by shoe pain, a box of mooncakes, a bunch of orchids. She is flipping out. Oh no, she worries. Now I really have to call him Sanker. I mean, the poor woman probably has no friends in America who knows what he's having her due. We may be here only linked to society. Caitlin finally does call, managing. to catch Xu Ping when my father is out on the beach doing his exercises. Although Xu Ping's English is very broken, Xu's somehow convinces Katelyn to fly down for a visit. It will be Katelyn's first trip home since our mother's passing. My first meeting of either of my fathers, too, Chinese wives. I pull up this familiar driveway in my geo, either Katelyn or I say anything. We pair out the windings. The yard doesn't look too bad. There are new sprinklers in a kind of intricate irrigation system made of a network of ingeniously placed rain-cutting soil has been turned and thought and may. Cypresses have been trimmed. Enormous bundles of weeds flanked the driveway, as though for some amentic occasion. We ring the doorbell. Neither of us have had keys to the house and news. The door opens. Short somewhat plump Chinese woman in round. glasses in a perfect bowl haircut beams at us. She was wearing a bright yellow eye-hate housework apron that my mother was once given as a gag gift and I think never wore. Ka-lin! San-wa! She explains what seems  authentic joy embracing us. She is laughing in almost crying with emotion. In spite of myself, Gigol's begin to well-up from inside me as if from a spring. I can't help it. I feel warm and you for it. Authentic joy is contagious. Who cares who this woman is? No one has been this happy to see me in agents. Welcome home, Shuping says, careful emphasis. She turns to Caitlyn, a shadow falling over her face. I am so glad you finally come home to see you, Daddy. She says in a low sorrowful voice. She looks over her shoulder. He old now. Then, as if exhausted by that effort. Chuping collapses into giggles. I sneak a glance over at Caitlyn, whose expression seems to be straining somewhere between joy and nausea. I jump nervously in. It's so nice to finally meet Choo. How do you  Los Angeles? I've heard so much about your cooking! My father goes off to put some music on his new CD player. That bad Lou made me buy it, he explains. But it is nice. Chuping bustles into the kitchen. In a ready, in five minutes, she declares. Caitlin waits a beat, and pulls me aside into the bathroom and slams the door. This is so weird, she has us. We have not stood together in this bathroom for some 15 years. Seems somehow different. I notice that the wallpaper is fading, and towels are new. But no, it's something else. On one wall is my mother's framed reproduction. Up the floor. Brown-Divinci etching called praying hands, which he had always kept in her so-and-row. Right next to it, in shocking juxtaposition, is a green, red, and yellow bank of canton calendar, featuring a zoptic Asian female in a mixing. I can't go through with this Caitlyn continues in stage whisper. It's too weird. There are so many memories here, and not good ones. Unlike debris from her can, the words tumble out. I go by the kitchen and all I can see is me standing before the oven clock at age 5 with tears in my eyes. He is yelling, what time is it? The little hand is most of the way to four and the big hand is on the eight. It was 3 18 22 minutes ago. So what time is it now? What's 18 plus 22? Come on, you can do it in your head. Come on, come on. I go by the dining room and I see him hurling my Nancy Drew books across the floor. They slam against the wall and I huddle against mom screaming. Why do you- waste your time on this when your algebra homework isn't finished. You good for nothing. You're nothing. Nothing. You'll never amount to anything. I go by the bedroof. Please. I have this sickening feeling  I'm going to cry that I'm just going to lose it. I want to just sit down the middle of the floor and roll myself into a ball. But I can't. Caitlyn's rage is  something uncontainable. A dreadful natural force and I am the gatekeeper. I feel if I open the door, it will rush out and destroy the house and everything in it. Please, is what I end up with spring. Please, let's just eat. We'll be done in an hour. Then we can go home. My promise. We won't have to do this again for another 10 years. Or maybe ever. At dinner, endless plates of food twirl their way out of the kitchen, shooting practically dancing underneath. Spinach, karaoke-ish chicken, shrimp, some kind of egg thing with peas, dumplings packed with little pillows and pork. And amazingly, there is no one to conversational material. Photos from Shanghai are being pulled out of envelopes and passed around, of her family, his family. I do recognize three or four Chinese relatives. A cousin. and aunt, a grand uncle. Their names are impossible for me to remember. We had met them in China during our last trip as a family. I was 15. It was right before our mother started to get sick. Shanghai is a distant confused memory for me, a ringing bicycle bells and laundry lines hanging from buildings. What I do remember is how curious my father's family had seen about Caitlyn and me. He's odd American experiment, owing over our height and touching our Auburn here. There were many smiles but no intelligible conversation, at least to art years. We probably won't see any of these people again before we die. But Shuping will have none of her hearty, mentoring and builder that she is. She is determined to use the crew to buy for us for broken English to forge a rickety rope bridge between us. You stand where you. You play the piano, no? Most art, in very night. You were shown me. And you, Catland, you, you are a teacher, no? That is good, Catland, good, Catland! You are very, very good! My father puts his spoon down. He's chewing slow, a frown growing. This meat, he shakes his head, is very, very grease. He turns to shoe pain in the lines of both sides of his mouth deepened. Use Iitclap. He says something to her in Chinese with a certain sharp cadence that makes my spine stiffen. Shuping's face goes blank from him. Her eyes go big. My stomach turns to ice. How will she respond? By throwing her napkin down, bursting into tears, running from the room. Will she knock the table over, play sliding after each other, sauce is spilling, crockery breaking? Will we hear the car engine turn over, she drives up into the night, leaving us here? fear frightened and panic. It is none of these things. Shupin's head tilts back her eyes, crinkle, and the laughter pours out of you. Peel after peel after peel.
