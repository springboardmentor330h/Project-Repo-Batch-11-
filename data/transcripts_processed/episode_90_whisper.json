  "text": "I had the strange experience last night. And these tapes, recorded on my answering machine, 10 years ago, tapes that I had not heard any decade, until last night. And, , I don't think I can play these tapes for you. I don't think that people want them to give the permission. On one tape there's a brief conversation between me and this woman, who lived with for seven years, accidentally recorded by the answering machine, just as we were squatting up. And on this tape she's calling me from the street to say that she's going to remove it and I thought I got to come along. She's got to have it, isn't it? And she indicates that I'm not welcome. And then I tell her why I guess maybe I really do have too much work to do and some laundry that I have to get done. And when you're in the conversation she asks, I mean, do you have to wait and I say no. And she says, well, I thought you said you had all this work to do. she's catching me in a long life. I mean she is. She is catching me in a long life, but . I've been committed her bidding. And then she asked me if I'm absolutely sure that I'm going to get her laundry done that night. And it's a long short. It was hard to listen to. I mean I can hear myself being so scared of her in this tale. And in the same conversation she talks about. this guy who just a few weeks later she got involved with next serious relationship that for me. And I talked about this woman who I was just that just at the end of this serious way after her. And that part of the conversation is very awkward, very  very awkward. And before I heard this tape I could not have remembered much about that summer. That summer where we were splitting up in 1988. After seven years. But hearing the tape, it all came back where we lived, what was in the apartment, what we used to wear, how we talked to each other, and how I thought, oh, talk, when we got it. This way that I don't do anymore. And it wasn't  we're getting it, photos. , pictures are cold, no pictures are. He's tiny little, the tiny, , you can hold them in your hand. They're  three by five, you can crush up your shirt. This was not first, and it was not small. And part of that I think is just the power of four things. And part of it was the fact that we were on, it was something that we, on, power of all. It's just so in, talking to a person on the phone, it's you are right there, you're so calm. It's  you're whispering in each other's ears. Through these tapes of Lyndon Johnson and Telephone, in this audio book called Taking Charge, but story and Michael Best was. And Best was, makes the argument without these recordings Lyndon Johnson on the Telephone. And a quick part of Johnson will be completely lost in the story. These tips are so raw. We hear him operating on people in this way that is so, the best lesson is that it really comes through and transcripts of meetings and public events and just trying to charm people and pride in the plan that we can assist in strong-longing them. And he's more honest than a friend that he wasn't public. In public, Johnson said that people even wanted permission report on the telephony admitted that he didn't believe it. And he didn't believe it. that alone assassin, we Harvey Oswald acted along, killing J.F.K. The public counsel supported the Vietnam War. On the top of the eight-minute is down. I would say the other more I understood the way Clay's night thing, that this thing. The more I think that I don't know what in me, heo, the words that attacked me were getting into another courier. This worries in a lot of mad. I don't see what we can ever hope to get out of there with once we're committed. He's talking to you at Nash's courier. I don't think he's worth it far and I don't think we can get out and it's just a big stamp yesterday so I've no class. I look in this sergeant mine, Smyrne, that's a little kid who's there and he's getting out of my things, bringing me in my migrating and all that kind stuff. I just thought about ordering. Or it was kids in there. What in the hell am I ordering him out there? One thing that I was going to say at the name of the week, what is loud for it to me? What is worth to this country? Now, of course, you start running the company. They may just chase you right in your own kit. That's trouble. And that is what the rest of the world is going to think of this thing comes apart on us. That's the development. That's exactly what I thought. But everybody I talked to has got any sense now that this is all my God. Please give us a word to us. It's gonna be easier to get in water. which when we open our lyrics, it's a very good instrument. Very sensitive to the fact that people who are having trouble with this instrument. When we tell a phone, we are who we truly are. Some of the time in one. Well, from WB Easy Chicago, Public Radio International, it's American Life, I'm on a class. Each week in a program, of course, which is a theme, we move right in different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program. Telephone stories. What we reveal better is something that we do not reveal any other way. Back one, when the wall came tumbling down, story of teenager, the liquid drug use, lying, stealing, and the kids  to quickly change. When you heard how he sounded on the phone. Back two, when your telephone is your medium. Sure,  you can try to get your pop songs and records on the radio on TNTV. But what if your medium of choice? the telephone. We offer a kiss example, but then they might be giants. three, telephone as history, moments from a normal human life saved on answering, some of this. Let's get a telephone number for a moment and let's start with a zip code. 9 0 2 1 That's where the story takes place. Literally. Joshua was a student at Beverly Hills High School. He did a lot of money, he did a lot of drugs. And he started doing it in a pretty serious one. It was a failed PE. I thought it was difficult to do. Unless you're even running off getting snowed, whatever you're supposed to be running around the track. I just... , I just did whatever I wanted to do, whenever I wanted to do it. , I stole money for my parents to get ready to finance my marijuana habit. I did break into my parents' tenets basically house a few times. Mostly steel drugs, not mine. But that's it! I was the only stealing what I did. I never actually stole anything except for drugs and money. And the money I was still for a parent. Well I noticed my dad started to punish me for things that I hadn't done or at least things that he couldn't have possibly known. And  I would have great... weekend planned, for instance, we were going to go out and do whatever. So it's a craziness with, would come up, , maybe we'll go, take some LSD or something  that, and wash your house. And my dad would, would growl me the day before, , for, for no particular reason. It was very strange, timing is uncanny. And one day he was driving me down to school, as he did every morning. And on the way to school he told me that the administration of the Beverly had contacted him and that they were going to, they had knocks in the school that were posing as students and they were going to run a suite of the school and basically bust everyone who was in the school. involved in this. So he told me that the administration had contacted him because they knew that I was involved in this whole faction of bad eggs. And they also knew that I was not a dealer. Basically they were calling him to warn him to basically give me a chance to get out of that. bust. So he told me, , I better get it together because it's gonna happen very soon. And then in the same conversation, he started naming all of the names of the kids that were involved in, and there were names that there was no way to get out. And so the story was very credible. The way it was laid out. I deleted 100% and I would just go to school that day. I remember and I told, of course I told all of my friends, that was going to be this major bus happening in Beverly Hills High School very soon and so everybody very quickly going to cover and people became much more careful. I'm going to let you out. About a month later I was in the backyard. And there had been a windstorm the night before, really big wind and a panel on the side of the house and come off. I was in the backyard with my friend and we were smoking a joint. we always did every day after school, we would come home to look at joint. And my friend noticed this panel down, I have never forget this one actually. Dude, what is this? Come here, dude, and I'm  standing on the other side of the backyard, smoking a joint, looking at the trees, and say, come here, dude, and I said, what do you think? Look at this, and it didn't dawn on me. I looked at it, and I was , what is it? Strange piece of machinery inside of wall. It made no sense to me whatsoever. And he looked at me, said, dude, your parents are taping your halls. And that meant that dad knew everything. And the one that he's proud. It's a true moment, , you might party life. I'm getting late, so I'm going to go over here tonight. Yes, listen, if you guys want to come to school, you'll go. Well, even though we're here, you won't, you won't. Yeah, because I know it's not so hot there. Rodin's but didn't When I saw the tableboard, it was disbelief. I was in a state of disperse. Pure shock. This is what happened. I suddenly was a very good state. All of a sudden, his grades started collapsed. His school thing started collapsing. He started acting  a complete fool. Now he's ready to graduate from Beverly Hills. And his attitude to this becoming a total of f***ed blocks and he's becoming a asshole everywhere. So I thought,  the only way I can see. figure out what's going to happen with you. Is because he comes home every day and he's alone all the long time at home. He's got a lot of time on the phone. Right? So I figured, well, what I'll do is that I'll tape record his phone calls. So I went to a lot of people who were about to scan the stuff and how can I do this? They said, well, what you have to do is get a voice activated tape recorder. Yes, I thought he was taking time into the cam number so he could see the scene. Oh, that's my phone number. And then I got theSc scanneruted photo warrant. So, on him I asked him ... But he heard an alarm beeping, suddenly a quote again. We said, is it sensor 71  yes? Need to have someone and findmumbles? Looking for anything, is level 23 is in only a minute, but inside of our limit. to hook it up to the phone. So I removed and outside wall of my house which was a bunch of boards. Remove it, built it into one situation where I could clamp it back on with magnets. So I could take it off, put it back on. I put this tape recorder inside the wall outside of my kitchen. The wire went down and then it went through the wall into the tape recorder. I figured nobody's is ever going to notice that because it's way down on the bottom way under everything. , who's going to look for the goddamn wire where the phone goes, ? I'm hungry, I can't believe this is going on. multiple emotional cascade because on the one hand, , I'm being incredibly violated by my father. But I would give him whatever we could give him everything you could possibly give him. And then I felt I felt real violated by the fact that he thought that was nothing. What meant something to him was that he wanted to do these things that he wanted to do. He wanted to be with these people. He wanted to be with it. I went home today during this fall. Yeah. You've turned my room upside down, didn't you? All I know is that there was a nose on our front door from Annie. That's right. It's good for someone. It has been in our apartment, they can. Taking certain things. What was this? It was a nose on it. No, no, no. Go on. I didn't get any to get. No. I just, I got that one, but my friend was off. I want to know if you go in her apartment again. Yeah, I feel getting more positive. I want to know if you go in her apartment. Yes. And I took one, my new book, I didn't take drugs. one small one, and I love. Okay, you go to work. Good tonight, I want to have a little discussion with you. Take your time and I have to try to find out where your cover's on. I don't know. I probably just think that you figured out that something else happened. No, dad. No. She never came to my work during today. It was going. school, never. He's start coming my work, he's done gone at lunchtime, he's say, , hey, I just came over to see if you guys needed any help or if anything I could do or whatever and then he'd leave and then it'd be  a hundred, two hundred bucks missing from the drawer. No. Show up quickly. Show up quickly. Show up quickly. Catcher-わか… Erd and creepy noises… wszystko… Star- lighter… It's indeed a sub caterpillar… Something comin' to the side… What... it's a… into theichte… Seriously… . If you're a kid on the phone, they stay on the phone for a long time. Ouch! I would come home and I would have to listen to you  three or four hours. Take him on the phone. Say nothing. I mean, it's ribble. , hey, hey man. , what's up? What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. But the interest part is that things we can around  what are we gonna do tomorrow? Hey, why don't we do some? Hope, why don't we do some? I mean, but what I would what I tried to do was that whenever I heard something on this tape that that was  a direction he was gonna go in, I would say could you help me at my shop? tomorrow at 4 o'clock. I really need you and he goes, oh I'm busy and I say I don't care how busy you are. I really need you. This is important and he would he would shut off the plans. He would help me. So what I tried to do by listening to the tapes was to redirect whatever he was going to do. And I did that and it worked. It worked. He said that anything they do with parents. We're talking serious. Which did what happened, that realization was a true news department. It's very short for them saying problems and no improvements may be around. This is a great rocket set with a very good one. There are so many names to be there. I've never even said it now. I'm sure it's happening to the doctor. It's everything. It's kind of about 50 hundred cover-not-to-the-skill. That was all now. We can't do it this far, but that's what I have. I'm not ignoring the doctor. I have there. I'm just not. There was no way I could possibly confront him and have a truthful situation to come out of it. He would never admit that to me. Never. The tape recorder. It's a tape recorder. realize, well, what am I going to do? What's the way out of this? Because I, , I was going to write rhymes, get it to a best solution to escape. So after some thought, I decided that the best, the best road of action would be to continue my life's down, of course. And while simultaneously becoming perfect on the telephone. In other words, I would just flee to my house. You're quick. Yes, you're quick. That's it. It's causing me to miss trouble. Aren't you going to miss it? No, wait. Fortunately, part of the thing is, you're , I'll grow kind of. Not really , and it's probably been the tool out of it. Get bored of it. You should be careful. Yeah, you should get the apple. Yeah. Well that went on for that a month. It went on for about a month of me being perfect on the telephone. And it worked. He stopped busking me in crucial months. I was able to go out and do everything I wanted to. I alerted everyone at Beverly that in fact there wasn't going to be a sweet that was all part of this scandal perpetrated. by my father and much to their release. So that would not for that month. This is counter-esbian, I mean, you have to call it, and it worked. It had gotten to the point of deception, a plan deception, a plan deception. I mean, multiple lines on both sides. So, that was great. disturbed by the fact that my relationship with my father had so apparently deteriorated. My father means a lot to me and he did that always and I realized the degree to which we had grown apart. So One night I went out with a couple of friends and we took some LSDs for a... strong LSD that we bought down Hollywood for rock, the dealer. He's down there at that time. Guy by the name of our strange. He was his name. He was an albino. I think he's dead now. But anyway, in the throes of my of this LSD realization in light, that I was going through, I realized that situation with my father was completely unacceptable. And it had to be remedy. right away. I had to do something to eat in the morning. So I told my two poor friends who were also right in the middle of their trip getting involved in whatever was going on in their minds. I said, we have to go to my house. So we drove here and Dad was having a party. He was a party going on. I walked into the party, , rather known Shalongi. And I looked at my fucking... The very serious look and I said, I have to talk to you about something. So we walked outside to the yard and I said basically I'm gathering. I know you're taping recalls and I mean, I'm taping recalls. Which was such a strange sort of accusation. I was making it. What's again, because simultaneously I was admitting to him that I knew that he knew everything was going on. So on the one hand, I'm saying, Dad,  how to be so horrible as to invade my privacy this. And I'll simultaneously realize that he knew that I had been stealing money from it, just to support my pot habits. He said, you're right, I'm taking your calls. I've been doing it for quite a while, so perfect. And I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm not going to take your telephone call for one. He said there's something you don't know yet. But I'll tell you now and perhaps you will not understand what I'm saying. But you think that because I'm your father, and I'm in this role of the disciplinary . between you and I, what you haven't realized yet is that your actions have far more impact on your own life than they will online. I've already made my life. You have to make your life and you don't know it yet. He said, I'm going to take the tape recorder out tomorrow. And I was waiting for the punishment. must be some amazing punishment coming down because you knew everything. what Terry's school or what what's he going to do? He said, I'll take the tape recorder out tomorrow and there's only one thing I want to do. The Chris said, what? And he said, I have about 40 tapes, about 40, 90 minute tapes of you. I'm going to give him to you and I want you to listen to them. That's all there is. No punishment. No, we're not. This is over. This chapter is over. But the tapes are now yours. Rewrs. melody My He was embarrassing. I was embarrassing myself listening to myself. I was about to wake up towards him. I couldn't really listen to him. I had a very hard in a way it was kind of surrealistic because I had no idea what I sounded  and I didn't  what I sounded  at all. I thought I sounded really, , kind of untrained self-serving me basic and totally uncaring. I'm not a video. I'm a paper-ass guy. I'm a paper-ass guy. I'm a paper-ass guy. It was very self-centered and existential. And during the mother, people used a belt. I was... I was the star. Stage. Everybody else can face me. Got a hell. As far as I was concerned. I had never realized that aspect was for a person out. It didn't go. How me? It didn't sense any value. Hello? Hello? What's going on? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? And he got this. And I'm going to record that. So, that's what the message says. So long, so, that's what it says. So, he's got. Oh, I see. So, , I see. , you've got this. You have so much. So, we were so much. We were right there. And we got this. And we got this. And we got this. And I would have have listened to that on James, such a part. And again, it was just  God, God, God, God, I'm lost. Is that where it is? Is that you? I don't feel that way, I'm not that person. But at the time, I was very much trying to know it. And now, how little I thought. about what the heart is. To me about five or six years before I managed to listen to all of her, my course of life changed dramatically as a bad man. And I'm watching, I'm so apart. I put it back as far as the importance where it was of higher earnings. Smoking pot ceased to be the one. It lying, seeing she didn't see me. All that I just stopped. Stopped at all. It was amazing. He understood the entire thing that... he was doing that was so that I believe he was stupid because I never had the opportunity to hear him say, it no, it no, what else do ? The tone of voice, quote quote friends, I could hear in their voice, the tapes, pain, this my actions, mine, unsure, that that was in a way, kidding. I've been trying to make sure that I have a good review for a while. This is a bit weird when, last time we talked, I called you. I don't know if you actually tried. So I just remembered that. Really? I became the watcher of myself while I was acting so intensely. And I still do that to this day. Bye. I see I'm intensely aware of my effect on other people. That's one thing that definitely counts. It's  I know what other people are feeling about me. That was an interesting look you gave. No, I know. So what's the problem with you? What are you guys talking to? I don't know. Is it that hard to work again? No. Perfectly. What's wrong? Well, I guess the basic thing is I don't  your fluctuation. It has your sweet. Now, what are you talking about? If I'm not doing someone with my wrong side of set place, then I'm off to and I'm weak. probably usually late. Then I stopped talking. And this would be more fun. Forget it. We got it. It's used valuable, very valuable skills to witness myself. All the pain. I got to see myself. It's a rare gift. It's a great gift. to be able to see yourself from the outside. I'm just joking. I think it's probably always going to be difficult to watch yourself. Given an opportunity, I think most people would probably not want to see themselves that clearly. Joshua & his father have a great book with a psychoist and gives him the doctor. Who turned free? I wonder why I said Ahhh... woke up I text out a 설명 clue is now doin' it resonant waaaaaa out imma out in My boo without imma evil逐你们 key发 WOAH I got a tombo amma Oop Write A Effoo Who watch It's so Y p Coming up, telephone is an artistic medium, telephone is news, what a songwriter can learn from the telephone. It's in a minute, from public radio international, Wayne Arpog. This is American Life from our class which we can have program of course which is theme, write a variety of reporters and writers on earth to tackle that theme. Successor...? If your argument was so bad, we are on to find them from that we cannot find anywhere else. We arrived at Act 2 of our program when the telephone is your medium. Well, the band they might be trying to not have a song on every episode of this man. But, I have to say, most weeks at some point, triggering editor Sarah Vals just a song that there's that might work to show. And that's because they are not only progithic, more than other bands. We write about an astonishing number of things in this... surprising funny way. Also, although there were an actual pop band with actual pop hits, it is hard to think of any man in the last 20 years with more inventive arrangements that just have this sound, the sense of different instruments, go together. They bring pre-rock instruments into the rock universe, and it's completely charming way. Chang'an L of the Muppy Giants, he is the keythritures, the bass harmonette. And at the heart, the artistic practices. That  where it is, it's sharp, you have to do it in the shot. what the theme is,  what I'm going with, and the part of their artistic practice is the telephone. Who was it? Still sort of it. Zero thou, is it? One of Art Costs, a quarter of pop. What if it offered home delivery? What if it was short but sweet? What if Art was just a phone call away? No, that's not coming on, dude. Wait, did you get any ну- The cans, fighting down. Sorry, bringing that one, Khabha at first. If the owner had wanted it, he would've handed it on and boiled it on the menu, but the owner Lemon confirmation caught on a to say, we're calling her now, it's not service. I hope you  it. Hope it sounds good over your phone. Thank you for calling Callback anytime. They call me doctor. They call me doctor. They call me doctor. I'm a just lady. I'm not real. I'm a boy. I'm a baby. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. It's a simple, beautiful idea. Let's say... anyone anywhere anytime can phone a number in Brooklyn listen to one as they might be giants wonderful or wonderfully weird songs and it doesn't cost anything more than any other normal call. Dialoson's motto, free when you call from work. When John Plansberg and John Lonell of they might be giant started their dial-assong service 15 years ago, they didn't have a record contract. All they had was an answering machine and a treat. And that dream was to get people to cite their friends to hear their music. Then, they got a record deal. They were on the radio, on MTE, but they considered dismantling the democratic empire of dial-assong. But they were afraid their fans would accuse them of selling. out, returning their back on the people. And by the people, I mean the people. They can understand that the first year. The first five years even. But it's been 15 years now. This funny little idea that they had back during the early break in administration now it's just who they are. Lady, in gentlemen, they rock the stage, they rock the records, they rock the phone lines. Do you remember the first song? The first time. The first time. and I said it up, I was living in the part of the sun, I'm coming up in the sky, but it was a toddler highway. It recorded really quietly because we had this problem with the moment he worked. The lab's sound with this particular model would actually tell the machine that that was the end of the message. It would take us to the main. It would take us to the main. So almost all our songs had to be connected to the heat. And that particular note was completely off-limits. There are many, many times there is a long note. song, we'd have to break it up. We'd actually  to pop it out of the thing. So just  I've been asking, I've been asking, I've been asking, I've just kind of keep it , from going just from China.
