When you get to the pole, it looks exactly  all the other ice you can stare in your hours. So, first climb out of the plane, don't let you get half an hour to pole. What do I have to do with the time? Take pictures. And then let's move to tr له.ming flexors.gps. And they spend their time working at the device which tells them that yes, this isn't back the North Pole, because I mean, we can't. Getting over to a plane and working around there'd be nothing to tell you that you're at the North Pole. They can use a secret fire by powering up the duty of , I really was actually as we talked, I have no picture in my head of what would be at the North Pole except what you would see in  a kids cartoon which has a barber pole sticking out of the ground, but there's no such a thing right? No, and it seems ridiculous and... I laughed but I had to ask you, where's the barber? Really? Yeah, but we usually with the group, we take up some kind of a fake barber pool and get in the extra more just, sure, say, ? Oh, yeah. There are the people who always want to know where they are in the world. To move through the world, checking your position. And just kind of travel that we all do sometimes. So, about that moment of view are here. , you check where you are, you check the map, snapshot, you move on. But our phone is just an extreme example. Because of course, there's nothing there. what to meet. You're only there for half an hour. It costs 30,000 dollars per person. And for recently, a regular civilian would have no way to confirm that they were at the North Pole. Since normal conferences, we could want on the airplane that they knew you were going to otherwise we could have to go close to the mic. that it's basically tip in the dirt sitting in and is unreliable. It'll be 60 degrees off of how we're having tips as if to say, don't forget it. Yeah, exactly. And then this is sort of person who kind of enjoys the moment when the compass stops working. When there's no way to tell exactly where you are, and no global positioning system will help you figure it out. Good luck, Nick. Now that everyone has GPS because in a way, it's certainly nice to know where you are and takes away a bit of the panic factor, doesn't matter what part of the world's year ends, but there is something lost there and always know it exactly where you are. One of the ways it's the opposite of a bench. Sure, and adventure means it becomes more than art when it comes to finding out or thinking of where you are and where you want to end up. On today's radio program, three stories, three people, three sets of maps, and we're just  the D-W-A-S. And we also struggle in that moment not to give ourselves over to fear. Hopefully, try to enjoy it. From W-B-E-Z-S-S-C-A-G-L, and public radio and international, it's a American life. I'm Arad Baz. Back one of our program today, is Shtar Daze, A-Rabian Knights. A man tries to lose himself completely. Leave the places charted on maps, and what happens to you, and what you find when you try to leave the known world  this, and succeed. Back to. Again, right or David, sit there, or spine, himself in a room full of people on a foreign city. Doesn't speak the language, it doesn't know anyone. There's one simple submission. A mission that you yourself may be capable of. That's great. When you can snatch the trouble for my hand. the grasshopper, then you can leave. One, low paid office worker Christ operated a global positioning apparatus from the map of current higher life. Say, what's my friend? Macwan, it's star days, Ray biennites. Back in the year was 21, John Bowed decided to visit a friend of his, who was in the Peace Corps in Molli. But he chose, I have to say, the most difficult possible route to get there. It's all the hitchhiker cars. this character. And not just Hitchite, but Hitchite using Able Mode, Rude, 1000 miles long that most Hitchite groups would be about no special gear, or it's small bag, but mostly with books, one change of clothes, one of the good places on the map, if you were into those. I don't know, when you travel a lot, when you're when you're traveling and just sort of gripping around, you spend a lot of time looking at the map and you sort of exoticize it and you sort of get the sword relationship to it, , where you start to see the work, this was kind of cool getting to this remote area, video would be kind of cool. get to that area, but there's that much more remote. , you wanna go off the map. You wanna go off the map? You wanna go off the map? When you go off the map, when you go off the area with a brodo turn map. Right, but you wanna go off the map in a more metaphorical sense too, you want to get off the grid of American line. The grid of the modern world, I want to get away from white people. American techno-living is kind of defined world culture. How easy or how hard it was to get off from here. Well that's one of the really interesting things you can hop on a plane from anywhere, to anywhere, hop on another little plane or train or something else, and then walk 20 feet in the middle of nowhere. Just one of the weirdest things I would have wanted to take plane probably from New York to Manouse, Brazil. take a boat immediately be lost in the middle of the rain forest we take you all the day together. So the idea was to hit check across the southern part of the desert and at first I had had the idea because of my cross-deavish from the map. I was hoping they indicated that there's still a camel caravan goes back and forth from southern Morocco and Timbuktu. and I kept asking people around , is there still a camel caravan that does this thing? People were kind of saying, yeah, but people who were trying to sell me stuff. Yeah, well, but you're gonna need a lot of stuff in the journey, you buy 300 bucks for the stuff. It says, it's , well, I'm just making sure that the caravan person is funny. Later I found out about some gear where you can't do it actually for a thousand dollars with a gear. And they said, oh, he had just be here. They sold him a camel and just wait here. That okay. On the second Sunday of every month, the guys all come to the end. You can start your journey then. So that seemed  it wasn't going to happen. So then I went to Algeria down to Cameron's set. I went through to the way I felt. I'm going to take a look there and run. And it's weird flying off the desert because... We used this thing that we're in now, clock, see, just see what it is you're getting into. It's just sand. And maybe 30 miles over the right of the plant. There might be little low aces, this little cluster of trees around it. And maybe 50 miles over to the left. There might be another one. , but on the ground that's 80 miles. Step by step. You can see in this 130 tree's wire. Such fine. But, clearly fine. And it's at that point when you're still on the safe. of airplane you're still on the mount. You're still on the grid. That you definitely got the sense of the play that this is sort of the loudest stop on the grid. So I get to the outskirts of town and of course in the Michelin Mount. They're looking town. Origin. Okay, here we go. Another way. The original map marks roads as arbitrary. Back in the night even sick and pre-chist if your life depended on. Pretty soon, mine was going to. Because they make these things look  roads. But you don't realize until you get to all the art or track in the sand. Will the sand just blow over them and then this is nothing. Right. And there are dust-darm's frequently in this area. The arm-run set is located in this place called the Ogar, which is filmed a lot from... or something, whatever they're doing, as commercials where someone says, and we went to the harshest environment to test whatever die hard bad or whatever. That's where they go. So anyway, so I got to the outer part of town and I'm looking for what appears in the map to be a road. I've got my Michelin map, and I've got this faulty compass that it just sort of would spin around and never be consistent. Really? Yeah, it was really bad thing in a compass, but it's right. Subscribe to the compass, please. , I can't remember much of that. It was a little cheap to a $3 compass. I mean, this was the whole problem with the trip in so many ways. I just deliberately outfitted myself as poorly as possible. So anyway, anyway, so you there. Okay, so I'm there. My compass is spinning around. Not even wildly as a sort of lazily spinning around . I couldn't find any paved roads. It's these pirate trucks. Radiating out. All directions come to doubt. You have no setters. no such thing as science. , Denver this way never will that way. Right. And I, , I don't stop from it. This is kind of stupid. I have a leader of water. No provision to any kind. And I'm talking about heading across 1000 miles. It just didn't enter my head that you clearly have spaghetti. What I was doing. What was it? What were you? Is it just a sort of, yeah, you think you're being... rather than stupid. Yeah. You're just looking at the goal of trying to get lost. Well, this is cool, but there's a sitting here. And you can always go further for their off-bat. Oh, I bet , and never done this. But there's something prideful about it. This is so stupid. No one else would dare to do this. I mean, I bet , and else has ever set off over a couple of miles. And then they're with court waters or pocket. So I start walking. And again, it's 120 degrees. He waves everywhere and he's there walking down the road. Now, for a mile or two, a truck came along. So I often went to this guy who turned out to be named Karumi and we're cruising along. And it's just, it's so incredibly desperate. Everyone's on visit this street, across the road. You got the sense of you were out here in the speed. Long, you would be gone, second. Am I really in the end? I thought that stuff  your car broke down from the heat. You were dead. You were just dead. There were so many days to row with cars didn't go by at all. And then no mad put in that sick comment in your car. You just speak in the spirit. Good morning! Hello, welcome to earth. So anyway, so welcome to the morning we drove the rest of the way and got this town to meet me in the afternoon and I walked over to a border post place in town in the flag behind over it and There was this guy who seemed to be the head official who was just kind of bloated around on a mattress on bed stand in the street outside the border post sitting around in shadows picking his nails It's not high Brian, I get my passport stamp and he said, well, I'm just sit down. So he said, okay, , so he just sort of , talking. And finally after, well, I said, so do you think you could stamp my passport? No, he said, okay, well, I'm ready to stamp your passport now. And I looked around and I could find it. I said, well, I think I must have given it. I'm gonna do you, right? Did I give a two before and he said, yeah, but I gave it back to you. I just looked through my stuff again. I said, no, I must be somewhere. I think you have it because I really don't have it. So are you better check again? Do you mind it down? I can't stand that. You can be stuck here. Can , we ain't... That's so... I check one more time. I'm gonna completely sweaty. And then he just kinda... Good, slightly. And he lifts his leg and it's behinding. He just  the whole pack. He's , I got you. I got you. which is now a unusual border post that shall be heavier. So anyway, so he is such thing that if you are a border guard there is one job that you can enact and never cross-homor. And that is the ancient joke that joke it's back centuries. As long as they were people and borders there could be that joke. Been passed down from a long line of Frank's good border guards. So he tells the joke and then he says, ha ha, I'm moving friends by that. It's a, you joke pickup caught in the rise of the order folks. And it's this quarry, no man. We just six of them. Eight of them. Now it's been a little bit about the quarry. It's, look at the quarry. I really, really, really into the column. Blue, friends, the blue man. Because they have the nails, died of the mega. In the, get to the floor of their skin so either when they take off their veil, their skin is a purple town. Some of the women tattoo their gums with some indigo thing so that they have these weird purple gums. It's actually really cool looking. And maybe in the desert. Yeah, they were controlling the whole salt trade back during the evil ages when Europe was getting salt from the African stuff. It didn't mean to help a lot of money. It did live very well. And they have this very regal barren used to have their very own slave tribe called the Bella and My friend the friendly border post guy Started mumbling to Daven pointing over to me and many came over me and said oh good They're gonna take you to do a favor Get him car Before I knew it I was bounding out of town back to pick up rock The we're sitting back of it. I had to take that big Back there So we go taking off and after about 10 or 15 minutes they stopped the truck and they without these bats and they start to break. These are hangback shut up and they start to start to get out of the truck. They're not going to be in the truck. They're not going to be in the truck. They're not going to be in the truck. They're not going to be in the truck. They said, oh, we have help and I helped. So we've pushed our truck and we get going again. And then after a few minutes they stopped the truck. And I'm thinking I really wish that we would just turn it all last and get in my place And they stopped the truck and they explained to me oh yeah, this truck isn't so good Oh Okay, well, that's no problems. It's not hard as they're you So they get out their tools to fix the truck and what they have is sort of a beaten up screwdriver and a pliers And they get under the truck can get a sort of smashing around and dropping. So one point they ask me to come down and help look under these cars. If I can help fix it. So I get underneath the car with them. And I realize you don't have any more idea than I do, but they're doing. They're just taking the screwdriver and it's going to feel quite awesome. Fossing around with them. So it's there to done it. So I'm really bad place to be kind of path to path to path to path. And I didn't want to be in the ass and start thinking about my street guy scary. There's about 170,000 degrees of the e-buried and they just, that's what makes them be down. They don't worry. So you're kind of boiling over inside, but you don't want to be a baby about it. And now, so you're starting to try to do business with them. Look out for me. I'm not trying to tell. I want to go through my water on a sip of water every minute. but I'm already two thirds away from the water. So I look third of the heater. So anyway, so we start off. Trock again, and this is going on for hours. It's getting new. Again, the whole routine continues to stop in the car. We can stop the prey. Stop the car, and I'm starting to go crazy. It really doesn't take off. It's going to go for the stressful situation. You are. right at San, I'll need to take a little while. So I start running out of water. Oh, okay. I'll throw a message from you. They had a baby with them. And the baby that they have is just sitting there getting more and more and more sickly. And I start just focusing on this baby. They're watching it docked. And it looks  for sure as babies within a day or two of them. And the baby is all wrapped up. So it can't move its hands and feet. And it's quirk-based is just sitting there, sticking out of his mom back, looking at me. And it's eyes. getting off cross-feed with all this boo. At least flies are coming around and circling around if I sucking into goo. These flies suck and sucking just blood. Any available moisture in this environment gets sucked out. That's what nature of the desert is. It just starts making you think any... ...hender just gets sucked out and you just start getting completely crazy. That's what life is all about. So one time we stopped and we're sitting there for half an hour and a customer and there's other nomads arrived seemingly out of nowhere on camelback and they say, hey guys, are you in trouble? This person money we could probably help you out. And our guys yelled at them and you could tell they were swear and they were getting into a fight and then the new nomads, the new arrivals came up and they said, , you guys look  losers. Do you want to where you going so I'm going to Apple fucking well for I don't have any dollars to get to a ride there and I guess I was tied  I wanted to get a lot of there and maybe live but also I think it for example but I also felt kind of tied to these gaps right and I didn't wanted this shot on that so I said no no thanks and they said well Good luck and they sort of rode off and I was just killing myself for not I just don't know You really should have found this guy's stuff really he'll release for a few with a really not happening So we just keep having his right every 10 minutes. They say well, I think we better just put up with the night here So we break half and they whip all the stuff out of the back of the block and the number is blankets Make a fire This is f-a at this point you have gotten your dish you have to grab you have to eat you've let the map Right it all came to it had right in this night because they all go to bed and they're clustered up in this big wall together And I'm all alone after the second there is sleep, and I'm all alone As I just sat there staring at the fire and the windows picking up and making them noise incredibly lonely and throwable when they're going to be alone. , wandering around the picking up and stuff alone, there is not the setting to be in. You can exclude these people who are asleep 200 yards over there. There is not a setting being for hundreds of miles, and only one wandering around. And it's just incredibly lonely. And that's around the time I sort of heard this click. Not a lot, but it's just funny, I always. You can suddenly get the sense of, yeah, you are really off the map. You are so far off the map, you've never been this far off the map. And it started imagining, , , for example, what would happen if you died out here? You would just be gone forever, if you could follow it up. There would be no memory, no record whatsoever, if it happened to you. No one who ever knew you would go to find you. You are completely, you wanted to lose control, and now you've lost control. But you just catch... This little collectible universe name is the silent little This says oh you passed the point no return There are no words you could use to describe what that feeling is I'm so naive. Oh the world is so cruel. Oh my god. This is what you wanted. This is what you got No, I could die. I could die. I could die today now You could have been right now And so it's just that feeling of you, play it yourself. You did it. You kept going further and further out on a limb and now it just broke. And you're , why Lee Pioiode, , you just, you're above the two mild deep chasm, just waiting to fall. I don't know, I think this was a very arrogant talk. saying, well, dear world, you have to kill me or tell me what's interesting about you. Something, , yeah, it means to me believe in a film. Right, dear God, give me what I want or I'm going to go shop elsewhere. And you don't do that. That's really arrogant. You don't demand answers  that. And I think the answer that I got was no thanks. We're just going to  make you. profoundly unpleasant. I'm just gonna see how a lot of you. And then we'll be , yeah. Jump-os now right during New York. After a day with Clark, No Man's a truck came by which put him in motion to record now and much later for a song. Coming up David Cedera plays a game pretending he's lost. He's at over an hour, plays and plays and plays until one day. The experience is the real thing and does not much  it. That's in a minute. I'm a great international. And I'm a program in the continues. Just an American life, my request, which we can overcome of course, which is a theme that ready to increase. and that's the space program you are here. So there's people getting lost and how people react to getting lost so people can see kids and can be scared by it. We've wrapped it up two of our program at two, the game. Yes, it can be frightening to get lost. But what if you could adapt the thrill of getting lost, pleasure getting lost to safe parameters, can find it just get a little tiny bit lost? Is it even possible is that playing with fire in your shoulder to get burned? Go to the beach. that the city has made the attempt himself. So of course, kidding. Whenever I find myself in a strange unusual situation, I  to play this thing. To begin with, I have to retain that part of my brain is been asleep for exactly one year, while the rest of my body is an answering from carrying my unusual inclusion. Now I've suddenly woken up, and I can't leave this spot until I gathered clues and figured out exactly where I need. The game is generally played during those. moments when people tend to pinch themselves as they were more than a traumatic turn in life as they can . An example from a trip given as reward from a college graduation. I'm standing in a grim, sender black building looking out who arose of force on Twitter to rain to cross the concrete floor, much  the seats in movie theater. Manor sitting on these toilets. Some of them talking are reading the newspaper. Another is just staring ahead. Does that happen to water on the floor? bottle cap blooms far, followed by a plastic spoon. I probably came in to use the earring, but rather than get my shoes wet, I'm deciding that maybe I'll just hold it and try some for yourselves. I turned to leave, but I came in. The game is begun now, according to the rules. I'll have to stay in this bathroom, until I either hear or read the name of this game. At this point the exercise becomes more of an obsession of game. It's not particularly fun to stand on your toes in an unventilated public corner. But I'm powerless to leave and to the person I was one year ago has figured out the years. Okay, I think let's break this down. The people in the bathroom are speaking Spanish. They appear to be Mexican, but that's not good enough. They could be, I don't know, on vacation. something. In the far corner of the room, the teenage boy is playing maraday, and that's probably my best bet. I'm hoping that sooner or later the announcement might mention the call letters, adding that his is a number one station wherever it is in Hacking Beach. Unfortunately, the radio is currently broadcasting what appears to be the Spanish equivalent of American pot. I'm waiting, waiting for the song, and the man enters a bathroom carrying the shaman. I read the name. the story followed by the words next to the coastline. me then in my free to rush outdoors when my crab room contains these Jesus. What took you so long? I take pleasure in the game partly because my life so rarely takes you to the medical room. To put it mildly, I am a revocable. By preferred phrase being you go ahead someone needs to stay behind and take care of the cats. My hey could. your travel is partially what makes the game so rewarding. I  to dream quality of waking up in this dream place in a clinical way in which I'm forced to view my surroundings. The game is never arranged in the France, it just kicks in on some. Usually profit by a combination of visual elements that need upon this notion. In play it in pleasant circumstances, the effect is not comfortable. Another example. I come to when I find myself sitting in cat-bay, miring a corpse-grim in the end of a dearest leg. Something to chance to get properly belongs to me.

The objects before me became a long-sighted shade or made from an animal, a waitress appears saying, he must have been over the terrace by standing by the river, oh he made such lovely things. The woman speaks English in an accent that I can't quite identify, except to say that she probably recognizes the authority of the community. She sets down the company key, I had a parent in the order, and I thank it. See you next time, bye and see you next time. And I watched a young mother fill the baby's bottle with coke. Looking for one person to the next, I realized that I have the best teeth in the world. I have never in my life been such a situation. And I proceed to take full advantage of it. I'm grinning  an idiot in my boyfriend here when there's a room that's a seat for soft. He's not in anything but he's anything worth with anything.

It's now the game is her fault. I'm enjoying these little cafe views for documents. And although he's present, his end didn't meet, written, told her of the room's finest teeth. I want to take my time to play the reason he's. You sit for a few minutes before the wait for swoops, formally in. So she says, are you enjoying yourself, dear? Get locked, her. To be spares. She and you get caught in within two minutes. She's mentioned the street, the country, everything has become suspense. Check please. I played the game since my first trip to summer, but in all that time, I never have knowledge with some parents. While the David I can tend to be with a shock to find himself in Rome, Valencia, Gaston's. The David I was at the time knew very well the who's in Italy, Spain, spending two weeks and cheerier. Space crew just assimilations,  one of those emergency procedures, it's an act that I asked them out to train.

And it's , Whenever they turn the 不錯照 Valencia to the crime and to see the screen or the �- outright crime they're just  all people that sealed their stripes. They get suit in diff accident and fear. But it's also beautiful. Collapsion for that plen pod, on the timeline, what they mean? What can I say first? I didn't want this. I'm in a grocery store, besides in the plastic wrap, meets in vegetables. I'm not finding much that I can hold on to. It isn't that they're selling anything you marked the exact time. It's just that I can't do the noodles. Here each word includes no less than 15 letters. In every box you can, seems to picture a strapping family unit, smiling body for no apparent reason. The six-ocard in the evening the story is proud of the well-dressed compassion, sung by Holmes and One. I'm standing in what smells the soul from shampoo-satch, when a young woman approaches, pushing her shopping cart to cheap. Her shiny chestnut colored hair and some front of her face, and told she looks her hair and hair with shadows and other shoulders. The woman wears a new length skirt and the knit sludders blouse and has no arms whatsoever. She stands beside me. And then she slips off when her loopholes and reaches for her plastic pot in her bear fort. There is no awkwardness to this moment. Her leg moves gracefully and her foot works no different than it is. It's even decorated. Her nails are, there's a gold bracelet, she's wearing a wedding band in the details. I'm curious as to how she might take her her grum shoes, but we get separated at the registers. I realize that the more important press she is. I will pay for my groceries. I understand neither the currency nor the language. So my best bet will be to hand the cashier the largest bill I've got and hope that's enough to cover it. There are only a few items in my basket. The tube of what is hopefully toothpaste but possibly a vaginal lubricant. The cigarette lighter and the shape of a jeanie. And five tens of cancels. I've emptied my items under the belt when I noticed that everyone around me is carrying an empty customer to say how much time is spent. of rose petals. I myself have no sack. The cashier office me no plastic bag, and so after paying with my large bill, I stopped a lighter cat food in toothpaste into my pockets, pretending that this is the way I prefer to carry my rose shoes home from the store. It's difficult to walk properly with both my front-hand back pockets, and I'm ready to return to my hotel. than I noticed the harmless woman walked out with a bag held between the two and then the game between the nerves. I'm looking up and down the busy street hoping to read the name of this city on a shop window. When I suddenly realized I have absolutely no idea why. I'd recognize me if I saw it written down but other than that I haven't got to my first instinct is to throw up. my hands and scream  a girl, it is only the great effort that I managed to silence myself. I know for a fact that I am in Germany but I honestly can't remember where I am. I'm here on a promotion, eight cities at the course of the week. Monday was Berlin, Tuesday was still gone, followed by manhorns, but where am I today? It's a half hour walk back to my hotel but that doesn't run. Okay, the hotel, I just can't locate myself. Neither can I leave this block and return to the hotel before the game is finished. And this presents a pop in this my house will be taking me up a little less than an hour. Yes, it's just a game, yes, it's just a rule. But it's  me, you're just a compulsive man,  that games and rules aren't everything. I'm thinking I might return to the grocery store and see if I'd got a magazine left but now I can't walk in because my pockets are full of cash for me and they might very reasonably mistaken for a shop left now. A shoe store, a bakery, a record shop, one stand selling flowers and another selling sausages. Through their windows I see nothing else. I tell myself that sooner or later a possible coming home, bearing the city's name and bright, easy to read words. 20 minutes passed before an 8th funeral thing down at the end of the house, and the dooms that wherever I am, it is definitely not on a bus stop. I am racing up and down the block, desperate for evidence when I suddenly start thinking about human downs. I've seen him once when we shared a flight between its New York. He moves to the airport, morning his own business, and I followed along behind him, watching people rush forward to say, hey, you're you downs. What are you doing with me? in Sarasana. He did nothing for folk-dismissports, in his courteous even when the dunes at the X-face air stopped him for an autograph, saying, well if it isn't you down, it's host of 2020, what are you doing here in Queens? For him the game would be a snap. So he developed all time with the sees, all he had to do is walk out the door and willing strangers would tell everything he needed to know. You used the host today's show, you're you downed! What are you doing here and phone the blind? Due to his television solopathy, he benefits from what I now refer to as the Downsinger. The man couldn't get lost and his life depended him. In my mind it was now me, against him, he had these. This sensitive competition spurred me on, and within minutes I was right through the corner crash, and cursing, he downs me and every use, he moves in the sposal time. It meets the crumpled flyers and crushed paper cups. I came across a discarded ATMs, and there it was. There I was. Say, in the corners. I retracted all the mean things I thought about you down. Took a moment to glow, and then, all I'm in awe of what the person I used to be. I walked back to my hotel room in the German city. Cool. It's time to fly into life's mystery It's time to go somewhere. It's now seen, it's time to fly into the darkness to be flying to the moon. Actually, Snatch the Pebble for my handgrass hopper and then you can move. There's quite a lot of people in certain professional fields called SISTEN. Head friend was the assistant, Grand Paris Dan, and he's assistant, Grand Paris and a Totemberg, and for a New Yorker magazine writer, then for a New Yorker editor, and in all of those years, he's a Swampot, and she watched her 20s every way. It seemed impossible to her ever break the yolk of the SISTEN hood. SISTEN It feels to do the job of the system. It's from phones, facts and beautifully. For entirely different than this goes needed for the jobs that all systems really want. That is those own things and things. It's trash. The call grave is an assistant to an editor at a publishing house. It's a new shooter. She finds herself cracking and mapped to her own life because of her very assistant. She needs a map to where she's going. She's lost. She does not know where she is and she is not happy about all this. She's set up the lines. some map to give her a set, a sense of, , you are here. When I was in school, I majored in what is arguably the least useful subject in English thinking. And yet, I always saw my future as this vast, sunny stretch of infinite possibilities. And then I before I started my first job as an editorialist, Simon and Schuster. I couldn't fall asleep in just hours, I'd be hitting that glorious horizon, I'd been speeding for his life. Finally, the thing about the wide and limitless teacher that no one warns you about, once you get there, it ceases to be wide and limitless. The millions of possibilities suddenly crystallized with one choice, one present, one single high five sheep. With one swift move, I'd narrow the world of options, stand for, phone for walls and... in the pot. So I often get to leave this photo. In school, it's always fair how to succeed. As long as you work hard, get good grades, you move ahead. But in this job, I felt  I hated that app. The gap between assistance and editors seemed unbridged. You never saw them cut deals, never watch the make decisions, never heard them talking to them all. On my one ear. of nursery at Simon's Shuster, I received a commemorative pen which I used the next day to do. I decided to track down some of the people who started off right where I am now, and the same job, same company, same building, same floor. To see if anything became of them. To the job action. leads anywhere. They could show me where I was headed and give me the map I wanted to get my self there. I began just 20 steps for my own death. Michael Corta, Simon and Schuster's editor and she started here at his net toilet in 1958. Just 41 short years ago. Well, I'm not sure that I'm the blondest example of it. 45. The story, particularly in positive bookcraft, for example, is a music, six, and a rock switch. Michael went on to list the multitude of ways in which I'm nothing  him. His father won Academy Awards, his mother and aunt were famous actresses in Europe. His uncle directed his first feature film at the age of 20. At 20, my dad's pumping gas in the outskirts of Syria. Soak him at the age of 20. the number of things that were in my case I'm just in this class. There is a, I can read the least green language, blue language, blue language, blue language. Where exactly did foreign languages fit into my position anyway? As Michael talked more about his time as a assistant, it dawned on me. His job hadn't been the same. on his mind at all. He was in a system back in the days when American companies still had a job called Secrets. Now, publishing, as in so many businesses, there aren't many sectors. Instead, they hire college grads  me. Pay us less money, we vague promises of front of us, and trick us by calling us a system. I'm misleading title that makes us seeing  we're actually on the map. Headings. He pressed Michael for advice and he gave me a few of the usual suggestions. Work hard, read a lot, maintain a sense of purpose. But the most important thing I could do is an assistant he told me was to find some way to make myself stand out. In my experience, we greatly accept, I am as it happens for a few cents. The one thing that most editors don't realize, it's not nearly as convinced you successful will have everyone out. the court may then survive the need to learn the notes. So my guess is that almost any ever that would just say we'd be having somebody else looking for a safe and creative way to talk. That to me is the way that the director says. I took his advice and dropped it on my boss, Jeff Klausky, or who is editing a manuscript. Hey. Time to go and sit. There's not that, huh? Yeah. I mean, you  it. I can take that over later. I just want to gather here at some point. I can stay late and I'm going to do a few pages of it for pages. I  that too. I mean... Huh? I'm not going. Oh, okay. Well, I'm going to be changing the line. Yeah. Well, it was... Preus to be able to watch the videos? Yeah, I was just doing a little pain. �oughie and carrying From 1984 to 1988, Jenny Blue worked with the assistant to an editor who sits just too office and is downcoming. I thought her experience would be closer to him. And it was. me, she lived in a small and hadn't a partner that she shared with broaches. She danced with someone else's phone, she knew what a fact she was. But then her life truck ran. Well, I married an author. From Simon and Shester, so I met him in the lobby at Simon and Shester, where I went to get in the ring and then. They're kids are now 4, 5 and 7. Danny, Anna, and Tony, the olden. When I went to Jenny's house and Connecticut, the three of them in a plane night were running around the large sunny breakfast about to be picked up for a swimming lesson. Let's see him one. I wanted to see for a day. My early 20s were , runs on a ladder, editorial assistant editor, associate editor, editor, senior editor, , just  that. I assumed I would be able to have it all. I was, , I was going to have the job and I was going to have the kids and I was going to make it all work. When I had just had Tony, then I just delivered him and literally made positive the office from the hospital. I was really, I didn't want to be disconnected from working. And I think. I think there is such a thing as maternal instinct that I think it kicks in. I just even more than even more than wanting to be the office. I really wanted to be with a little baby. I don't know what I think. I think I'm really lucky with who I haven't what I've done. And I don't think percussion yet. I didn't think it would happen. If I died  John of Kennedy when I'm 38, am I going to say started a career? I hope that I hope something else. That's something you're going to have to grapple with. Do you think it's someone who's dude? I mean, it's almost  I'm on a pat only by virtue of being a woman and I can't change that path. You are doomed by your reality. If you're going to do to my mind the greatest thing you can do is a woman and have a child. You are doomed in a certain way. I think that's true and I didn't understand it. And I still have our time at it. I do. I feel it is unfair. , I wish I could have my dad back. Dooms. Not exactly the word I wanted to hear. I mean, pull idea for parent for a family, some housing so distant and unreal. I'm 22. A family cart might have to think about. A family for my math-off math. As I stood over the copying machine the next day. I tried to forget everything, just. I spoke with a few more performers. Forage, making an editor at 25, she discovered a book to be a TV type of a seller. She told me to stay to live in every night. Brooke knew who left signages to replace the plot of your, with the mansion, the main floor. Part of the none of this, I'll be a season-out of my own life. In fact, one former assistant has named Salt Anton. He's now a freelance magazine writer with a sunny duplex apartment in West Village. He told me he's looking the exact same thing I am. I really want somebody to give me a plan. Usually this person is my shrink. And twice a week, I go in there and I say, look, Can I just have the map please? My shrink says. I don't have a map to give you. You have to write that map. I say, but I don't want to write the map. I'm going to have to write the map. I'm going to make the map and I don't need a map. At Simon and Shuster, it was all exciting. I end my story with Phyllis TV. Who had everything I ever wanted at the time when she started. She started there in 1955. She had the story, but... public experience. What English majors all across the great nation have always dreamed to put me. There were people who first published the age long. There were people who started sentences with as my old friend, parents, dara, who used to say, it was quite a world to be put it. Everyone was involved. You could come into Jack's office at the end of the day. Nobody chose to go home because it was much more fun to be there. He had a bar in his office. Everyone came and sat down, had a drink and just sat and talked about books and things. He was... Nothing to be published in today, absolutely nothing. It was total crime. Allow me to provide some context. Editorial assistance these days don't even get to attend editorial meetings. So you can imagine my surprise, we've finished a little story. One day, Malcolm Cowley, who was a consulting editor who taught writing at the University of California, appeared in my door when he came to the... that and he handed the Manny script and said, what do you think of this? He gave it to me because I was the only person under 60 in the editor of staff. And I took it home that night and it was Ken Keezes, one through over the cookers. Next. Well, I came in the next day and went to the editorial meeting, which I'd sat to all the previous tele SAYslITE  they were in the same position and I just set up I read the great American novel. I don't care what any of you say. We have to publish this book, , the way I could do. And if he's given to me, and I would be editor of that book, then just as an assistant editor. Quick, reality check. My real job this week. Yeah. Really  all? all. I don't, I mean, I can check this a climb clock. We must check that podcast puzzle. Back to I. We'll just enter K family page. Will you close if  my website, who knows what it means to keep this view格? I guess. You're getting my phone. Okay. So there was Phyllis, she moved in with literary icons, editing the great American novel, but the most amazing thing about her, she didn't even want the fate she ended up with. We're talking 1950s. I was pro-grate, really. We all were then to think of work as not done. important and something you did to have a good time for a while until Mr. Perfect came. So what happened with Mr. Perfect? Never March. I'm not going to get it back. And there were actually two Mr. Perfect in both of them broke my heart and that's that's that's. Bill has became a magazine editor. She worked in Hollywood for a while, studying across the country, reading manuscripts. Now she's the book editor for Good House. I looked at her and posed elegant sparkly. I'm thought about how much she did. How much more she did for the nation. I guess one of the, , my whole life up in the public office point has been school. And in school you always know that you're in the right place because... When you're 15 years old, there's nowhere else you're supposed to be except high school. And you always feel  you're on the motorcycle and you see the horizon from a view and it's  that. The future. I always felt  hitting that horizon, when hitting that future, was gonna be  flying,  soaring. And I guess, I think not  that. That's a very young person's idea. it's just not  that. You're not, you're not in a pit, you're not something  at the beginning, that you're put. Not at all. You take each step where it leads you in if you... follow you, your heart with as much practicality as you have to have. You have to have that. But I've always been someone who followed my heart and probably if, , if I'd said, well, if you had it ever to do over again, would you do, would you change this? Would you change that? And the thing is to quote him anyway, isn't it pretty to think so? I mean, if I've even said to myself about the two great loves in my life, who, if I don't really chose another people, I could have had family to tell them about, , if I were given those same choices again, even knowing, even... know that they ended badly, I would make those same choices again. Because I believe in following your heart, that's what I do. And it's worked out just fine. I've had a good time. I thought over Phyllis's words later on. At the top here. The problem is following your heart. That hard is not a compass. It spins around and around, sometimes pausing, wobbly, landing nowhere in particular for very long. My heart swept half circles to California, swung back to going to grad school, and flunk down in front of the TV, not lying farther with either. My heart once landed on a guy named John, who's heart landed on a woman in Belize, and then my heart didn't do much of anything for a while. But I'm not sure if that's okay. It always does.
