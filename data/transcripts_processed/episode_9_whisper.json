  "text": "What happened to Stand Up Comedy in America is in a certain way a lot  what happened to the car industry. In the 1980s, Stand Up went to being a kind of handmade small scale affair to full-fledged mass production. And network comedy clubs cost country TV shows HBO specials an entire company. a channel on television. It was comedy in every home, comedy in every height, comedy in every garage, choose your own, tired metaphor from the 19 books. But as demand for stand-up comedy increased it outstripped the supply of quality product. And as happens in any industry where you get this supply demand in balance anywhere in the world. cutting corners. Going for the easy thing. Comedians, you were performing during that period, we'll tell you how clubs settled for cheaper, less experienced comics, how comics are encouraged to play to the lowest common denominator, and so clubs clubs that did make it. But before the flood of imported Japanese comics arrives on these shores. comics who are more efficient, smaller comics comics who can go further on the same joke. Again, you will help fill in your own tired cliche here. Before all that happens, out in Los Angeles, one group of American workers, Hakes to the stage each week. American comics, bravely, trying to turn the tide. in the round industry. Welcome to WB's Chicago System American Life. I'm Ira Glass. This is of course your weekly program documenting everyday life in the United States through whatever means. Tactics in the appropriate. And , on this program most weeks we choose a theme and we bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on the theme. Documentary stories, monologues, sound tapes, occasional radio players, anything we can... think of from a variety of different kinds of performers. But today, today we are going to try something different and we're going to devote the entire show to just one thing. If we're in usual, actually it's kind of unforgettable set of comic monobiles. Outing Los Angeles over the last few years. Yeah. Outing Los Angeles over the last few years. Noodle experiment to come this way now. It's called Uncaparate. Run by one. named Bethepetus and her husband Gregory Miller. And the Rosaline Cabaret art that no comic is a rather tell-a-story on stage that he or she has ever told before on stage. So this is kind of spontaneity built into, hoping by design. Sponnady that chooses back, send up on. And every Sunday, five or six writers have performers get on stage, and mostly what they talk about is what's happened over the course of the last week. And... This may not sound  much, but it has evolved into its own genre. Somewhere around diary, reportage, cultural commentary. And one of the most remarkable stories told it on Keverick, who's told in its dominance, over the course of about a year, by Julius Swing. Now you may remember Julius Swingy, from Saturday Night Live, she performed there for a while. She was best known for a sketch called Hat. And the joke with Pat was that, Pat was his character with Keverick. never figured was a man or a woman. And then after Pat on TV, there was Pat the movie, apparently didn't do very well. And from October of 1994, through August of 1985, to use many told stories that uncovered about something that's possibly the least likely subject, or stand a comedy. Hands. And you can actually hear her in these recordings. it self-conscious about the medium in which she has chosen to tell this story about how odd it is to be doing calm on the subject. But the stories themselves constitute such an unusual, really remarkable human-docular, partly because she's going through these horrible experiences, , the same week that she's telling us the story of it. And we're going to devote her. higher program to this today. Today's program will proceed in two acts. Back one, Julius brother gets cancer. Back two, Julius diagnosed with cancer. South. In treating. Some quick-heavy-ass-closed-gib. These tapes are made off the soundboard and uncovering and the sound quality is no less than graves. Also sometimes you'll hear a laughing and off-stage comments. During these monotes, there's a by the MC at Unkebrake with this. First bit is from October 23, 1994. And  part of being sick is dealing with everybody's you're high, when varsity. And a lot of the early stories that you used to tell us about the answer are about a family. Her brother moved in with her to be near the cancer treatment center, her was in the 6th. And her parents moved in. So yeah. Okay, my parents are staying with me. And when I say this week, I mean, it's just the first week. I think you've seen now we've got to start moving. Thanks to you, thank you, thank you. And then I said, why am I going to go to the airport? And I got all my eyes are watering. And this will be really problem with my face. This is special feeling to be at your mid-30s and have your parents moving in the, okay. I have a reveal of why my parents are here for so long. It's all this time. And I'm trying to think very hard about that most hilarious way without showing up. but  oh he's all right so briefly there's five kids in our family I'm the oldest and my brother is fourth child got limp hair and  and I very tragic terrible situation although he's doing very well and he has had the UCLA Cancer Center oh and  every day He has radiation and every other day he has a spinal path to the spinal and the donor species has a big number. So my pair, okay, so that's all you need to know about this is that I am with my parents, but in a very strange situation where I can't really yell at them, small annoying things that they do, which I would do normally because of the hard death. Oh, it's just... And yet for you, I can catch. All right. So... My mother! So anyway, some of us to say we're at UCLA Cancer Center and we're going to say, all right. My mother, who is, by the way, the same age as Dustin Hoffman, they were born on the same day. Keep this in mind. Every time we get on an elevator, she adds  it's a miracle invention that she's never encountered before. And you can imagine how many times we get on elevator and we're going to get on elevator as in the given day. Mini elevator. And every time I'm out. Well, every time I get on the elevator, I get into this just she and I getting on the elevator, I immediately push the door open, but because it takes so long for her to get in the elevator. And every time she goes, oh, oh! When the elevator arrives, and then I go in and push the door open and then she goes, oh! And then she takes a moment before she goes over the chasm between the hallway and the elevator. yourself at little metal thing or hurry up because the door is her going to close on a mad actually. Good. And then she was getting in and then she looked oh and then we go she's. And then when they open she goes. If  I really don't think that's an open does that and how many millions of times have we even on elevators together? Bill here. Alright, so , another big is my mother. She doesn't, she's from that generation that thinks that doctor, you never can see. This doctor is in and also she believes that all doctors have the same amount of knowledge in every area. So we're talking to the lymph specialists and then we'll be walking out of the hall, they'll be  a group of doctors. We know some of them. And , and they're not rushing around looking very caring. That's it. signal and she goes there's some doctors go ask if they know how lived and I go we're talking to the limp pantsa specialist in the country I think he knows the most about them cancer I don't know what these doctors do And I was thinking, you should call him and answer him about my condition. So I go, , I really don't think a gynaecologist who's been retired for 20 years. Is he going to know that much about this? OK, but you wonder what's that doing? He reads, he reads  he's very himself repeating. And then my dad is a diabetic. Weird. And then my brother also, who's now... So it would be also, he gets, he gives himself how to be named, but he has just some rinders hanging around my house. And so  a common thing for me is , okay, hold left there's syringes on the kitchen table. Dad? We have to throw them away. I break the needle off. This is it. All right. This is all an introduction to his last verse. And then I get to the post. Okay, so we're in the doctor's office and my cause doing really great It's funny really well. This treatment but he's had so many spinal pap because they can't get into spinal coma So the doctor said I was in my mom my dad's eating I'm playing in the that's a diversion and my mom is  looking at the dog My call you can't So we're thinking about putting a shot in your head. And my brother goes, why is it? And I ain't gonna do something , oh, what's that? an artificial opening frame. And it might go, well, where would this shot be? And it's not your coat. Well, that's the best place we've found is when it looks more hot. And my coat, if you think I am going to get a faucet put into my forehead. I'm already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I'm not gonna walk around for a year for the faucets. I'm thinking out of my porous. And my mom goes, no, I think it's  a spigot. And then the doctor goes, but the people we know, the patients that have this run say love, oh, they thank me for it because the pain is so much less than we do the operation because the brain there's no pain and my sister goes, oh, that's because you give them love, bottom means before you put the bottom in. And then my dad's looking up for me. Okay, anyway, so So so Thursday night I decided that I wanted to And it came out of this thing so I had to be right there to get and also I wanted to get away So so I get into my car and I'm driving to book soup and Or over took me and and I was and I had  no make fun of little stick and and overalls and you're not going to get to it and I was just  terrible but I thought I got to put it in and I started crying and I said oh what? why can't I just go on and if I am going to end and I'm really going to be over why can't I smoke? I'm not going to lose my whole cares if I get one cancer and I'm not going to lose that long even if I have lung cancer. So I'm going to buy a cigarette and I'm going to buy a cigarette and I'm going to smoke it and I'm going to go to a book Super, and I'm going to buy that book from a pulp and so time's off in the top So I get to that book so I know quite my eyes are all red and I think so then I go in and this I can see with that moment of your experience of leases and I don't understand the top , I'm about asking for this book, so I come in kind of scan the, no, look, store out the air. I was looking , I just put it on and I was just going to put it on and I was just looking at the down in the book. There was it one. And so, , I had to go to the formation, definitely. I go, hi, , looking for a book that came out today. Okay, goes up, Jesus right over there. I'm thinking the book, she says, or he's books. So I go over to this area and it's got red nuk, it goes in and box. So then I go back and I go, Oh no! Not the resonate, look the full, the popes book. So I covered, I get the book. And then I think, you want to get the book. So I saw some noise in the book. And I'm looking at titles , can you live through this? And you can make it. Why does things happen to people? And so I got it. And then finally, I kind of thought, oh, I wrote them in a set of books. It was, oh. So let's... the easiest guy to get a day. There is a tomorrow. I thought that's the book for me. So now I have the easiest guy to get a day and the Pope. And I think I'm covered. And there's not very many people in the bookstore and I can't even have a different one. And, , hope is up now, this is the most perfect thing. Without any warning, how different would være to infected, because I didn't see what you're going to look . That means my answer to the topic. I went out the biggest part. And I am not someone who has any problem with that. And I was a friend of humor in that kind of humor. And , it's  a whistle has gone off a book suit. it's just  everyone with the, and I don't know whether to rush out of that area or or around or, because there are, but okay, so right about, let's go! How does that been goes? True, yeah. You had my car. You recognized my car. Anyway, and I know recognize me at all. And I go, right. He goes, oh, he's going to be  this. And he goes, oh, and he goes, Marshall. Brown, and he goes, oh, Marshall, Marshall, oh, Marshall. Here I am, I'm getting the folks in the tower you. And he goes, hey, so, hey, when's the power of you coming out? Big red eyes. Okay, , I, , okay, who's my standard? We, we, we, we, we, , Allen, I knew, , but when or , and , they know, right? I don't know. No. No. And he goes, oh, so it was a bomb. And then he goes, , I just because no one's lost. That means a bomb. That meant to me. And he goes, oh, well, you were already just so, hey, how's Steve? They go, oh, I will, , we got to work this year. I'm so, oh, and, ... really good phrase thing from one and   what are you talking about? Oh no you guys were the cutest one boy. Well and then Piny goes oh is your brother still running the box off of the ground? And I go well no! Piny goes oh what's he have to really have to have stage four and so what I'm gonna go to keep the right books and then I put back the easy, but I really thought my book is really easy. It's not so good. You don't have a little hope, not a lot. Okay. So anyways, I go out. I go across the street by a pack of dinner. Now I'm really, I'm going to go to my house. I get into the car. My family is my car, I'll go to the house. And they eat cigarettes from. Okay, so I roll down. all the windows, right smoking and I'm actually starting to feel better. But my heart feels a little bit of a little bit too much. I feel better. You just had to go up. Okay, so, , some smoking, I'm really happy. And finally, I'm getting close to home, so I throw it straight out. Then I keep doing it because I was starting to smoke, it's really smokey. And then I blow into the driveway and I threw it around and my back seat is on fire. The cigarette has blown back into the car. And it's  a excited bite of seeds. The back. So I took a car and I put it out and I froze to the ground out. And I feel very  a girl's just smoking potters. I'm going into that. Oh, we'd find a way to describe property. I just wear the stuff. I'm smoking potters. Okay, so I go in. And it's gonna be , get it my mouth closed. I would do 30 minutes. And I go, oh, oh, tie you, tie you, tie you. believe what you happened to me. I was driving down sunset in this old myth smoking a cigarette. Throw it out of the car and I noticed because I thought smoking is terrible. And I got back in this cigarette with man in my car and I was , oh, that's sick. And my mom was , oh, it was a horrible thing I never heard. And she's going down. Oh, man was smoking next to you and I'm , yes, right next to me I was well on the passenger I had the passenger window open Where he would be on the other side of it because yes And I noticed him that Great And so she goes oh that's so horrible and so And then the next morning might be kind of moment I got this three-crap in it. So pretty. I'm with on this step. The driveway. And I have my step down. I go, well, there's a cigarette right now. And you go, there's a lipstick on it. And I go, oh! And my mom goes, you said it was an old mirror. And I go, oh, all right. Well, sunset Boulevard. . Well, there was on cabaret. in October of 1994. To use when he's next turn at the microphone, the next one that we're going to hear was three months later in January of 1995. My parents are staying with me. I know I say that every week, some pepper but okay because so that's the fact that I'm pregnant. Anyway, my parents are here because I have a brother who's very ill-pancers and he's, , I don't know if it's being well or not anymore but he is very very ill and so my parents are down. And there are,  any stressful situation, they're annoying, Paul's or personalities are heightened because it's a crisis situation. And it's made even more difficult for me because I can't yell at them about it because we are in a crisis. And it's , how could I really scream or I'm mother for talking to them so suddenly? , when her son is so very young. So when's the night I go out? And my brother is  really he's, ,  you guys are going to 20 pounds for these fiva 11 he's taking lots of drugs. We don't know if it's for the cancer We don't know who should yell at him about the drugs but then he has cancers You don't really want to get down on someone at that moment for that. Anyway, okay? I'm gonna grab my fucking heart as to make this funny. All right. So I go see how it's guest because Because I'm gonna see Philharman next week and I want to have seen it although now I probably shouldn't have seen it I could thinking of the way home, what are the scenes I can say you were funny and what's seen? All right. And he was a very funny guy. I guess making money and the whole time I was watching it thinking, PAP doesn't get a national release and how does Gaskas get the national release? All right. So this is my Wednesday. So I get home from Gaskas. I walk in the house. My brother is laid out on the couch. Literally  he's laid out. he's... laying for his hands on his chest, it's over, and he's just , this , because my dad, while I was at house gas, and someone was rushing up to me and saying, , oh, which corner to call, I, I go, oh, it's , and he's , and I go, oh, he's , great. And, and I go in in my mom, inner-safting she goes, oh, hi, I'm so glad you're here because I was wondering how house gas was, because I  sinbed, and I  him because I watched him on TV. TV and the living room doesn't coordinate with the cable anymore and I don't know how to change that because I want to watch a movie later and the movies on a video and I don't even know how to put the video into the machine and I was gonna try but I was making some soup and the soup started boiling over in your house. Okay. I come into the kitchen, my dad's standing in the kitchen with his drink. You go, hey, how was I supposed to get? Because I  that little ribbon and I go, oh, , it's okay. Then my mom was running, she goes, there's no cap food, there's no cap food. And I noticed that all the cats are , oh, my god, my baby. Also the other thing is having your parents in your house, they're  my parents means having every available audio device going in every room. The TV is on in every room of the house that there can be TV and if there's an TV, the radio is going on. So there's just a sound everywhere. Yeah. So I go, there's no camp food and she goes, I was gonna go to the store and get some, but then I didn't know what during, because you said the Fritzky's had too much fun. And then, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I go, okay, I'll go to the hotel now. It's the main hotel. It's the cold. So I leave and , I think God, it was three-grading items. Good sale. And , Now there's nothing  being a single woman in her 30s buying  $15 a cap would have midnight. That's a really good feeling. So I find my cap would and then I get home and in the meantime my dad goes to cash for so hungry that I give the drive food they hate and they won't eat it. And I go oh and I look down on the bulls who are filled with this drive food they hate that I don't know I have. So I go okay well I'm just going to throw that out and then my dad goes no I'll see that drive food really. That drive food really. I have a table here, a bowl out for the dry cabbage. And he's got one side of the capable, and I've got the other, and I've got, I just can throw the way. He's going, no, no, no, I'm just going to put it in the coverware. And I'm going, no, no, I'm really willing to just toss, , caution to the wind and throw this capable away. And he's going, no, no, no, and then of course, we pull it apart, tap through those sling- all on the kitchen, there's little pieces of capable to everywhere, landing in the soup, the spoiling over. And then right there, please, down, please pick it up. I'm putting it up and putting it pieces of cap food with a hair and ahhh And then at that moment so I go okay I'll just pick up my messages and then I pick up my messages and I have a message to my guy Nicole and just at 930 pm saying Calls immediately if you can give up a tumor But then the next month, but and while I'm getting that message my mom's standing there going , do  about a place called House of Blues? And who's going, I'm trying to listen to my music as- And then the next message is from him going, Oh, I'm terribly sorry, we've mixed up your results with someone else. And so then, I hang up the phone and I'm going, yes, I've heard of the house blues, and she goes, I love blues and gospel. I just love that. I love that music because I just love Gershwin. I don't even need more  10 years ago, I would have said, I'm going to listen to Gershwin, I'm going to listen to Gershwin. and gospel our blues, but I know I just go, oh, I know the blues are gospel with the Gershman. Go to the house of blues, they got it. So I get the cap food out, I break it out, I put it down the capter happy, the phone starts ringing, my mom's going, you think house of blues with the other night life in the yellow pages? I don't think there's a night life section in the yellow pages, but look all you want! And it's my sister calling from Japan and she's  this. Hi, I'm so glad you answered the phone. Because Mom and Dad want me to pay him that $48 of the National Geographic Subscriptions before they get the bill on their credit card, which I don't think is right. So I can put now to check for them. For $100! And I'm going to send it to them with a note saying, I don't want any more dealings with you. And I just go man, I cannot talk to you right now Oh, I know and I'm just thinking to break it and crying about National Geographic subscribers, I know even once I by the way am one of the recipients So I'm afraid that I have to  get the magazine and know all the Some of you just goes on getting the subscription to National Geographic Now then I realized the most big thing I was thinking is I get over somehow I'm here. Look there. But anyway, as I've always had this thing right,  my mom, it started with my mom that she'd say, obviously our case and everything were different. I would never decorate the way you did. , all of you are sharing the same way. But if you look at furniture and I go, I  to dark with one and she, , first the water. And she knows what I want you to get. You are house. You can have what you want. Okay, so that was her big thing. And then when I go, why are you yelling at Jimmy? My youngest. brother this way and she's saying, well when you have a child you can treat them the way you. But I'm gonna it. So I have this mental thing  I always am trying to be better than something's experienced in my past. it's  I'm always trying to have a better house to show  my parents are gonna learn how to raise kids better because the way I treat my cats I don't think so. And   but I realize the most thing is oh oh this is one of throughout the world. So my brother, they don't know, now the cancer,  they keep taking tests and the cancer gets less and less But he seems to be deteriorating anyway, and now they're getting a stroke. So my mom is going to The drug and he's not going to listen to me And I do an intervention on his answering machine because I don't have to train to really run over there and do this intervention right with smoke But I realized I was walking around this week thinking, , when I have cancer, I am going to act so much better. Well recently on the telephone, do you hear me tell me that a few months after she made that comment, what number I am? Well, she herself has diagnosed cancer. People who had been at the club that night would come up to her and remind her that she sent that She beauty does really good case of Beware of you wish for Coming up act to our program. Do you squeeze on your When I program Is this American life? I'm I regal's and most weeks on our program we choose some subject But why do I get rid of farmers a whack at that subject with the rich stories, and the entries, monologues, bound to it's whatever. But today we're breaking format, trying something different. And if you're just tuning in what we're doing is that we are devoting an entire hour to these unusual recordings, sort of part, comedy, part, diary, part, personal reportage, about cancer. This is a, do you suddenly put it at uncavillate in Los Angeles? We've now arrived at Act 2 of our program, one by one. in this actual year, gets diagnosed with cancer, itself. And one thing that's interesting about these tapes is that once you're assuming it actually gets cancer, the stories get less dark. They are less tragic, there is less trouble in them. This next tape, this from May of 1995, this is actually the worst sound quality in the week of the time, takes you to the treatment. And just one quick word for a public radio listeners who perhaps do not watch this next television, as many Americans do. SNL. she refers to SNL and it does not refer to the sale thrift that scored their nation during the meetings on 90s. SNL in this context is 75. So  about a month ago, I diagnosed cancer. Hopefully, I'm sorry. I wake up debating how it actually brings that up, but I think it's not  threatening and I'm totally sorry. And , in a way, I'm kind of happy to be experienced. My parents who are staying with me, wait. too long and it'd be at tail end of when they were going to be with me. Then I got cervical cancer and so of course they wanted to stay longer which is the last thing I wanted with my parents to say, being longer with me. And then I kept thinking, how can I lie about my, , so much? So my very good I lie three, five. How can I get my face up cancer on my own? Anyway, and so, and so I had to get this radical who has struck me which now that I've been this whole cancer thing, now radical disease. far out medical brothers. I know. Anyway, that's so then my mom. I did just make me more nervous than you. I really have friends that would be there and make it more calm and serious. But my mom knows I'm going to be looking for a doctor appointment and every surgery over here. And then I found myself saying, , free friends, didn't have to have fear wrong to dance. They had fear of his strength and he's on their own. I just realized, I can't hear that, but anyway, and I feel, , I mean, I wouldn't have chosen to have in his first, I guess, but I kind of feel about my reproductive organs  a bicycle that I've had in the garage, this really great bike that I've just never used. And, , but I want to, , but I just never had pride. And, , and it's a really good bike, , and it's in the garage, and I haven't really been maintaining it, or it's all recipe now and everything. But it's there,  what I bought it and I, , it's there. I have a garage for , and up. And now I feel  fate is saying to me, okay, we're taking away your bicycles never write a bike again. And so then you think, God, really get right that bike. But it's not , , then in the world, it's , well, , there's a lot of other, then I'll take the metaphor for it. But anyway, but young man, especially the SNL, be young. when you see the old writers behind the restaurant, they would call it go. I hurt that. You. Oh, it's great. Wait. Hey, go. Yeah, well, . There's a lot of other, I mean, I don't feel that pat about it. We go. That is the most precious thing you can guys. , , I go that's right because now my worth isn't woman. It has been taken away for me. And they go. This was cruel. Become Dota- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And then I would be women. Women are a fabric better who would have you big new age solution. They go,  my parents. That's what I'm saying. That's what she has. She drinks her tea, and now she's not seven children. And I'm , get me to the hospital. Really? Ah! Oh, I just did two little more cancer. bits for a bit. Okay, so I've been in the hospital and they saved my ovary, which I guess is a good thing I'm learning all about these biological things because the ovaries think to be lubricated through the ground, by the way, it's a very important thing. And, , if I wanted to have a child serrigantly I could have it. And so they, that was fine, they saved those. And, but then they didn't know exactly how everything was going to get into it. Oh, it's on. So they moved my ovaries nine inches up in their normal spot. And now... And that made sense. Well, , if you're really concerned about having a kid, , the surrogate, we can harvest 12 eggs now. And we can freeze them for you. And I said, oh, , okay, they go, oh, this you have to have to spoon with it in order to freeze them. We can't frozen eggs. They have to be fertilized eggs. So I go, oh, okay. And then, I think, okay, so you , Mary's no, you're going out to freeze them. I know. I know. I'm Friday. Before we see friends kiss, did you just fertilize full of things? And now. So, , I know my nowhere down. We're just gonna dating, bud. So I go, well, how many different Spoonie will get a help? And they go, well, , start up cos we're kinda high, but you can have five, , we're six. So I can have two eggs and per guy. So I see I see a guy. So. I thought okay, so now I feel  I have this dance part with 12 egg vomit if you are nuts enough to be a good apple to buy Anyway, then I just decided that's just tell weird I didn't do that so then the next thing this happened only two days ago I went into my radiation doctor and they have to do all these extra is an MRIs make sure that my ovaries were out of twin radiation And they cut  my clothing to my uterus So they come in and they go we have some bad news Oh, it's dying. They go, no, we've lost them. They go, you what? They go, we can't bring it. I go, you can't. They move in my pen and she's gonna be , here's on. And they go, well, one is there because sometimes, over is when they're cut off from their responsibilities, go traveling. And they go, Oh, very. So caught up with us to look into this whole life responsible of that damn uterus. He goes, oh, my show up and , just could just go floating through this Kameza where I go, am I going to , often is over here. Tonight. All right, that was May of 1995. This next. Is a little further into reach month later and just a quick one. Some of the language you're made up is suitable for younger girls. Alright, oh I had my vagina tattoo. Alright. It's true. Some people say, , I love Tom. Mine says, even the beans here. Alright. I have a little cancer. And so I had to have a hystricomy and now I'm having a baby. And everything seems to be fine, and , I'm on the gazillion percentile of making it But it doesn't mean that I don't have to have eight weeks of radiation and , so I'm right now I'm in the fourth week and So when you get radiation you have to get a tattoo on the area that you're gonna be great And so mine kind of a really something And so I was scared  and But there's the oh no it'll hurt but who cares? hard a lot. And so it's kind of, , as I'm late, I don't know my pants often than they frowning the tattoo on. It's , , there's a type of person who tattoos you. All right. And so this guy at first you kind of smiling at me  little too much, maybe he recognized me or called me for nothing else. And I wasn't sure I'm not going to really bring it up. And he has all saved anything. And so I'm pretty skinny back kind of look  high. And I was , see, is everyone to switch to get to that. Look, put it anyway. And I'm going to let him in. He's cutting my joint. And so, , I was spending some time together. And, and his his needs went down there doing that. , and I just find it so funny that it was hard not to laugh. He can't laugh because it had to have me a really spitting spot. , but they don't even try to get to talk to you. And then all of a sudden he's going  this and he goes, I think the best one is when Pat went to the barber. I'm , yeah that was a good lesson. I had been the Gickers now that Pett has super-go-gantuan. We knew what to do. All right. Oh, so, this is so personal. You can't even believe I'm telling you guys, but I guess that's a little fun. So, I just feel even though it'll make you come. All right, so the first half is external radiation where they be mu from the outside and then the second half that is start next week It's in true radiation Think it back Okay, so I call it the do-do radiation And in fact, I insist on referring to it as the do-do radiation Every doctor is really upset every because I go when do we start the do-do radiation And so I had to go in and get measured and they had to make this do- cylinder that fit exactly me in everything and I'm also in I go so this still though radiation would be vibrating and then the doctor goes actually it would be vibrate and it will and then it's this it makes it sick because the light in the stalkers eyes when he talks about health and the community it scares me because I really kind of feel  that's kind of the point if it is it, they get to do this to me. And, but, and  when they go , yes, you really need that because this is the kind of digital technology and hardly anyone's gotten this and we're really working on it. Ha ha ha ha. Do I really need it? Anyway, and so I have to go. And then, so then last week, we're trying to prepare before it. And everything, and they go, well, , it lasts three hours. Oh my God, yes. So I go three hours. And they said yes, and I said, oh. And also, I guess I won't get into detail with the other orps, is not airy walls, we can build with other instruments for three hours. So then I go, oh, I'm going to be said, you have an option. We can send you to the Cancer Therapist at Cedar Sinai to learn visualization techniques or we can give you an IV of value. Anyway, so... Awww! I'll actually kind of... back because they really were trying to push the visualization system. I'm very good at visualizing. And I, , I'm an actress and I'm  visualization is my hobby and my expertise. And I think when it comes to medical procedures, , an IV of value is going to work a lot better than thinking about an ocean. Oh yeah, this is another sick thing that I do. It's not funny only sick. I have this thing where I'm... close my closet, don't know that I'm cancer. And if I haven't worn them since before when I found out I had cancer, I had to close them when I put it I'll put on a dress and I'll think. And so they'll put on the dress and I'll think, oh, dress, don't you realize? None of the dress goes that terrible. Pick you Vioce. OK, well, that was J. June 4, 19th, five. Not long after that, Joey's sweetie returned to uncaverish, he was getting her treatment still. And she was getting her treatment at one hospital, whether he was getting treated in other hospital. And her case part was this very rare type of symptoms. And it turned out that the one doctor in this world who was studying this particular type of cancer happened to be located at his hospital, not at hers. And so at some point, slides the process. were shipped over to his hospital and then they were supposed to parents, so she had to get the slides back to the procedure and she offered to go and fetch the slides for sale. I didn't know where I was going. I knew his name was Dr. Foo. And so I go over and  it's not really part of the hospital where the research is done. It's another building and all restricted areas and I just kept going through doors and doors where people were wearing more green things,  what? I mean, , masks and stuff and I was  knocking on doors and I've, and I, everyone is so confused about what I wanted. And I'd have to say, hi, I'm looking for, , the Julius meaning. Chilters lied and they, oh, go, oh, for who? , when I say, Julius, we need me and they go, oh, and then finally they, I found this Doctor of Blues door. And I, I, I knocked on it and this little, , Asian man opened the door. And it's  literally out of a movie  there's  books to the ceiling and cobwebs. And I got a little, micro scope. And he goes, yes, and I said, yes, I hear that you have side, he's a mehterator service. And he says, yes, and I go, yes, I've come to pick up and he said, oh, well, how did you bring working out? And I said, oh, the Julius we need project. And I, he said, I don't know, I mean, but what research area are you? And I said, well, no, I mean, , , I'm Julius, I mean, he said, what? I said, yeah, I'm, I'm no, no, slide, that's me, don't... those sides are me and I want to give him back. And he comes up. What you're the person these guys you have to write your e-picture slides and I go, yeah and you're the person I go, yeah and he goes, he goes, oh my God. Those I've been seeing getting past this and he's a special kind of cancer for 20 years and we've been 50 women in the world that have been diagnosed with a special kind of cancer and one of the ones I've studied I've never met in the flesh of you. I've never had this cancer. except for you. And I said, oh, when he's , oh, please come in and sit down. I said, oh, and and he said, well, how does it feel to have this cancer? And I said, well, , I actually have no symptoms, , it's  kind of hilarious that I just have no symptoms. It seems all the problems with the cure of this, but not from the actual cancer. And he goes, oh, you know there's only 15 women in the world. And none of them have done. I'd permit, I'd go, oh, he was hoping. And I'd go, oh, great,  what? And he goes, oh, and he goes, oh, , he wanted to know if I'd been on Birkin' Hill pills because that's how what he thinks of the reality. And I'd go, oh, , we're asking to be living here, having to do it, and I'd go, oh, I'd  to run, ski, be people running, be they, for people who don't build, get the skats, and then he goes, oh, and then he goes, what can I think, , There was something and I said, yeah, I mean, I have to probably be happy to be with me maybe just moving around the cancer. Okay, well, then I found out a few weeks later after the slides went back that I didn't have that cancer. I had a different kind of really rare cervical cancer, but not that specific kind. And I don't think they ever really told that guy because this week he called me up. And he said, hey, how you doing? And everything and I said, oh, and fine, did all of the surgeries. I was too embarrassed to call my didn't have his cancer. I go, yeah, I think it goes well, I'm really glad , no one who's had that chance to ride. I had to go to hell to have a ride and it's , that's the night that I'm going to play. I'm so good at Ben and I did a lot of the thing that I did not have the cancer who was studying. I know what I'm doing. So sick. Okay, all these stories that we've been hearing began in night. in 1994 and finally in July of 1985. Do you swing it to the stage at Uncoverate to announce? I don't have cancer anymore. I only swing this because I don't know if any of you here were in other sets where you talked about it. I had a little campus and I did surgery and I did radiation and my last radiation from one's day. So now I can't say I have cancer anymore. Which I have to say I will totally cop. I'm kind of missing that because I just loved not necessarily doing but having that moment where I could say But now I can say I I guess that's the term although no and no no doctors even said that to me All right, you did enough. See you later I said don't you mean to tell me I'm in remission Okay, so So on Wednesday I had to have my last radiation and it's  this kind of horrible ordeal that last three hours And it's very personally in fact invasive into certain orcuses of your body Imagine and And then oh see I've been for my surgery. This is how sick I am. I would I had horrible, Domino surgery, , and it was  incredibly painful to me and they gave me Perkese and coden and everything and I would be an excruciating game and not take my pain pills to save them for a day when I did join them more My parents were saying to me I'd be And my mother go take the coding and I go Sure There would be a day when mixed with a mug of read-all, so it's happy Well, Julius, when he survived your cancer, and she's turned these monologues from my cabaret into a one-woman show. It's called God said, ha, it's not the coronette theater in Los Angeles. I'm apparently a big big hip. In the Father's Show, it's going to move to New York City, and Point and Tarantino is playing. on filming God said, huh, to release as a teacher's nail. So, you guys open for that, remember, oh, what grade you? So where you hear tomorrow's stars today? But not for reals, didn't. Anyway, Julia's mini's brother. Well, Julia's mini-yo came out of this line and a live with brother actually died. I've cancer two weeks after she was diagnosed. And we're talking about this death. for his last days on Cabaret, who some tragedies just to sad, to be turned into a family. But we thought we would end our program today with a story from January of 1995. This is a tape from four she knew that she had cancer. And when this was the brother we still are. And her family was really stuck. So anyway, oh, this is not even funny. Okay, I'll just tell it really quick. , I went to another. condition and I felt  it was actually a meeting. I felt  it weren't really well Great I Back to Santa Monica feeling so happy for the first time really long time because my parents are living with me And I'm so happy and so I'm walking the door and as I walk in the door I hear my mother yelling at my brother. Yeah drunk. That's what it is. I felt  some sort of awful No, it's  there's something is  it's a sort of  something I commit and and I go hi and she goes how is your meeting and I go it was good she does let you're brother and he is the are you and then my brother oh the stories to say this I end up hearing about my brother you so And then my mom's  going on and on and she doesn't know how to tell stories correctly. My daughter's thinking it's a huge prank. But she'll say, oh I have to tell you the most brief thing. I went to Billions and I ran into people and your father's dad got a bit of a good prank. And I just go Oh You can't find your change and you need someone from the Balkans at the store and why are you talking to people at the billions? Okay It is so I Just walk out of the house and go to the office for my dad is my dad I just about,  , I didn't feel similar to a few people and I got a little low and he says, oh and every mind of me, the other book we're back to West wrote, this can travel on. I was reading something about dirt travels and bulk is and it really hurt a lot of stuff. And  that every major war is starting to have bulk ends and stuff. We have this micellum cover paper and he's , how is your meat? I got all this really dreadful for a superman. I'm going to go back to my house. I need to talk to you in a bit. I'm so sorry. I know you're so pretty. This is so sad. Okay, so I go into the bedroom. Your father is driving me crazy, and I'm eating. But I'm not eating your healthy eatery. I go so, what does that mean? She goes, it means I am not sleeping in the gastro with him anymore. I need another piece of meat. And I'm thinking. Okay, brother who washing his hands, sleepy on this sofa in my office, I'm sleeping  in the dining room. The front is in my bedroom, I'm hearing her being a sister. And I just go, Mary, people who visit me must sleep together. I do not have enough beds for people to break up while they're visiting me. You must overcome your feelings and just sleep in the same bed, going after his phone, asleep. and get up before he wakes up and don't touch him in the night, but you got to stay in the room! Anyway, so mom's looks something couch and we got to the guest room, so we're all in the replacements. And it's open at 5am in the morning, I noticed the TV pop song, and in a lonely place and starting at 5pm, this is... ...rearing. Okay, so ... That's my mom's about to... It's just going, what's this in the amusement-something-right program? Anyway, I go! those Cheyels from the living room. She goes, Julie, there's a movie on about a lonely people. What is it? And I go, it's , Spider-Man, the word he's , oh, he's getting his way in, , Greek from War, the word. And she goes, , he was a drunk. And real life, too. They go, oh, and, boy, Graham, anyway, so slowly the whole family gets up and then all the sudden it's me. my two brothers at my mom and dad and we all walked in a little place. This is just pretty morning for 5 to 7 AM. Julia Smeney, I don't care for any Los Angeles.
