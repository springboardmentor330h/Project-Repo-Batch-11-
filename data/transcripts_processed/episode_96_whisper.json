But well, well, the year when they came the lottery, I sometimes played the number where I gave it up. So it didn't work, it didn't take the mind. It did you ever win? No, never won any money. It did you decide to do it? No, have I? Because I think that I should not remind myself of it. When something terrible happens to you, in the moment of crisis it's rare that you meditate of what it means. On your own, Tom. I was in concentration camps. Then it was sent to work in the German coal mines when he was selected for experimental surgery by the Germans. He didn't have bed dreams then he says, no, you're just too. He was just looking to get food and stuff  that. You're just looking, you're just going to be. Yeah, well, what happened? , in the morning. And as I'm getting older, I'm more and more hunted for my... The past is a cake of high-fab, but crying almost every night. I mean, I can do anything about it. So I try to be busy at Tiger Reed Booker, Tiger's name, do it. Forget, forget, hate. I bet present, not at all. Yeah. What memories come back? Sometimes he answers, but remember a holiday meal, some small happy memories of his family, died in the gas chambers. But that's rare, mostly it's the bad moments which come back. And Mungo's, the one he returns to more than any other moment, is the day in May of 1942, when his family was rounded up by the Germans in the rest. The whole thing will take you all, it's late, that's right, double. This, it took quite a lot of time. I remember the border, there were little genius. Sister, they put them to those big commercial baggage, for what they had made, but used to ship cows in an empty room. It was the last time you saw a sister. This little brother, his mother, stepfather. A moment that no matter how many times you look at it, never makes sense. One minute. The life is one thing, small, ripe, the next something else.

AmeriD来 Last, today on our program, hidden history, stories of people who have looked at out of every day alive, thrown into much bigger events, and how they need sense of what they hear. You're saying that. Act 1, book of Job, Manu betrayed his friends, and then betrayed the people who betrayed his friends for. Act 2, God of War. I will guide with one year of psychology graduate school. God put in a position to decide who would stay at the front lines and Vietnam and who could go home. May God help. How are you never wondering? And what he makes of all of it now. See what he's... Act one. So it's one thing if you  this throwing about by course is beyond your control. It's another if you go out of your way to insert yourself into history and hurt people. And ruin other people's lives as part of that. How do you make sense of events for which you only have yourself to find? Let's go carry it. the Sir story. February 17, 1957 was the worst day of Harvey Tussos' life. At 230 in the morning his mother called the say that his father died. At 830 his boss called the tell him not to come into work that he was fired. At 1130 his wife called him California saying she was close to Mexico and that she wanted a divorce. Then at 230 in the afternoon Harvey's lawyer called the say that the circuit court of appeals And now changed. had turned down as a peel and that he'd be going to a federal penitentiary for five years. what Harvey did? I don't know how. I put the shot down. People are killing me and letting me out. They're basically ready for the peel. And here I was laughing. And I read the book of the film and I read the book of the film that I've had. And I took the link to the link. And then took the link to the link. Joe Matuso, born at you and the Bronx, Joe Matuso, ready to die at Mormon, Glenwood, Utah. Joe Matuso, liberator of Europe, Joe Matuso, communists. Joe Matuso, who turned and became a paid informant against the communists during the McCarthy era. Joe Matuso, who turned again and said he lied and made it up and that the Justice Department knew it. was lying and in fact encouraged it. Joe Matuso, the most hated man in America, Joe Matuso, cocky-boothed clown. Joe Matuso has been married ten times to nine different women and is still one of the loneliest old men you'd ever want to meet. Joe Matuso, manager, program director and creator of Scott TV, the first and only public access station at Central Utah. Joe Matuso, cocky-man who tells you a prank that he's a cocky-man. and then conjured to Matusa, Kaio di, of all Kaio di's. I represent the most energy to go ahead. I turn on the coming, and I turn on the music right. That's what I believe in all your health. The trick with the Kaio di. is to not take sides. The trick is to see all things as being equal. This means accepting whatever the coyote says as being true, but it also means you accept the exact opposite of whatever the coyote says as being true as well. This is the way Job tells the story. This is the way he explains the events that led up to the worst day of his life and his decision to call himself Job by from the Bible. First he was a kid on the streets in the Bronx, running bats for field of bokeh and delivering bribes through policemen. Then his brother went off to the Second World War and got shot down over Germany. Then Job enlisted and managed to America to find his brother's unmarked grave in their embargo. Then he helped liberate Europe by digging bodies from out of the rubble and hanging out coffee shops with French intellectuals. When I joined the Communist Party, was as a result of the year. experiences with Communists in Europe in World War II. I found the Communists with the only substantial group of people who effectively stood up to Hitler and fought him effectively and occupied Europe. And wherever I went in liberated Europe, it was part of the infantry that liberated Europe. It's found Communists who are romantic to me, who are real. in the earnest Hemingway sense, the romance of Communism. He songs , Villains, ThegrRelef interested in·aumeau´ sing of the ievedself of the in New York City, 1946. By 1947, was a full-time employee operating the switchboard and screening calls at the National Headquarters during the day, and organized a new meeting tonight. He says he had the honor to raise the first ever Chinese Communist flag flown in the United States. He says he carried Paul ropes and junior under a blanket, back seat of his car, into the riots at peak skill. He was, he says, deeply wild and struggles. In the late 40s, it was a radical thing to be a communist. It was the beginning of the Cold War, the beginning of the evil empire. Lots of people, in fact, most people, believed that a war with the Soviet Union was inevitable. Then, in 1950, we did go to war with communist and Korea. And at that point, it was not radical to be a communist. It was impossible to be a communist. Being a communist meant losing your job, being publicly vilified, maybe it will go into the war. game. Joe, a more chaotic and communist saw that things were getting kind of hard. He says, when things get hot, he finds another place to play. At least that's how he tells the story sometimes. Other times, he tells it  this. The communist party to me became very full. Phone user 3 dollar bill. I found it in the critical and dishonest. And maybe because through, he also got content halfway. I entered into it. And I figured the code was getting crazy. The prosecutions were getting crazy. So I called the FBI. And I directed two, three, five hundred. And said, hi, my name is Harvey Petus. So I remember the time he was pretty long-todd. What was the extent of the conversation many times in the need? WHAT THE HIG gerr Thirty five Six Handmade Ten He followed the line Feel it So the government wanted me to be a witness and I met at a rounded blue point on the East River Drive, Field Client Deskett and this limousine pulls up, this guy can say I need to do Self is really calling, I get in the back of the limo and we take off and we talk. in the car. And he's interviewing me and this is a guy who grew up in my neighborhood in the Bronx. We have a lot in common with the same age. We were born a few months apart. And we hit it off real well. And while we were getting ready to prepare the meat for my testimony in the case, I used to go out party with Roy Con. Where would you do when you party? We go to this. We go to 21, we go to the party. How do ? Guys, in the mid-20s, go out of the party. Joe became a paid political informer, which was also a radical thing to be. At that time, in the early 50s, the exploits of FBI informers were celebrated in motion pictures, and television serials, and books, and a magazine articles. They were portrayed as brave heroes, who risked their lives. as communist, only to emerge as true patriots indispensable as Jay Agrihooper once said to the American Wifi. And it was a lucrative profession. The most charismatic and former supplemented their incomes with generous lecture fees, royalties from best-selling books, as well as radio, television and film rides to their harrowing exposades of the Red Menace. Though only 26 years old, Joe met with immediate success, and his first appearance on the witness standing in the 90s. at a hearing of the House Committee on American Activities. He was billed as an authority on the communist conspiracy penetrate the youth of America. Over night, his name was in the headland. Witness bears plot to infiltrate the Boy Scouts. Secret FBI man reveals 3,500 students recruited here for red fifth column. Hominus used sex to lure members. Jogo is a hit, a rising star. Clear... that I made up a game I made up the story. I did something nobody else did all these other witnesses were old man and old women. And here I come on a war veteran from two wars that he had listed in in just 20s and he's talking about communism and youth. But all these other guys were their 50s to 60s. I was a breath of fresh air for them. Job testified in front of the House Committee on American Activities, Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, government. operations committee, the subversive activities control board hearings, and in two criminal prosecutions for the justice department. One of which was the famous First Amendment case against Union Organizer, Clinton James. Job named hundreds of people's Congress, or communist sympathizers. Many of them have been his friends. When he ran out of people to need, he started making up stories. Anything that would make a good performance. Anything that would make it in the papers. For instance, on One of his lecture tours, he told a group of high school students, in Pogatella, Idaho, that he'd been sent by a Czechoslovakian delegation to New Mexico for a set up a system of lesbian arms at Los Alamos. He also said that the Soviet Union scheduled 1961 is the year to take over the United States. The press loved him, and he loved the press. Here I was meeting with people, editors, version newspapers, making up stories with them. I mean, I was going out and having dinner every night with the colonist Walter Winshel and he fell in love with me. So I go out and his old cat- convertible. He got a police radio and used the best no-journalist to country the time. And we go chase police calls. He listens to the police calls and shows where we're going. He goes a man and hang out with him. And I hang out every night and go to Tuchua's bar and hang out with all the celebrities from Hollywood and big shot, big, most f***ing stuff. There's a whole different dance, a whole different organ. Where I fabricated stories, as  I said, because I belonged to the American newspaper Guild, it was involved in organizing music. That the New York Sunday New York Times, I said, had a hundred and twenty-six cognitive working for it. When they only had either 78 or 96 employees at this point. I think it was big. And nobody, not even the New York Times, if a question. Did  that they were going to be on the news that night? Oh yeah, every night, the weeks, and turn on the boxes we've watched the news and there I was. They asked today, freaking out of America. And you knew you were doing it. very conscious of it. I knew I had the whole nation as it was in my I was in everybody's living room and it's a very strong feeling. In 1952 after Joe was already a hot shot paid political requirement he walked into Senator Joseph McCarthy's office in Washington and offered his services in McCarthy's reelection campaign. He became, he says, close friends were per cart. He says he even delivered 70% of a cart these campaign speeches. When the senator was in the hospital for alcohol, we made it over to him. Through McCarthy, Joe met the eras, our villa Bentley, one of McCarthy's biggest financial supporters. She became Joe second-of-life. It was unreal. Mary to woman led millions of dollars and she was a party-givier in live on Fancy Fox Wolf. road that houses now that you're in the best of the residents. And here I came from the streets of the Bronx running bets with the film, the bookie. And I was throwing dinner parties and washing them. My next one, neighbor, is Governor Evero Harman or a basketball Harman at that time. And when he moved out to go back to the York to become governor, Secretary of Treasury, Hofrey moved in next door. He'd be working the garden and I'd be out talking to the Secretary of Treasury because he was my neighbor. It wasn't a real... It was so surreal, it was  a Salvador Dalai painting. The only thing it missed with the melting clots growing off the rocks, the furniture. We're in Job's car driving down the highway in central Utah. His car is a 1970 Cadillac-grown divill of a color of study, but I am unable to discern. He's got the car he says by getting down on his knees and praying. He asked God to give him a car and God gave him this one. Lidden, London, Paris, New York, Melbourne, Sydney, Berlin, San Francisco, Boston, and you name him when I've lived there. But not of a bit of a beast we've got here. Two years ago, Job came to the small farming community of Glenwood, Utah. And he said, . old school bus loaded with consumer grade video production equipment and in short order he started six counties access television public access station that shows high school band practice the local church choir doing Messiah, drill team competitions and also the magic mouse magazine, Job's nonviolent kid show. He has more than 100 hours of magic mouse magazine on tape. Each show is hosted by Job playing hockey booth in the clan. Right now we're in the car driving around changing the magic mouse tapes at various cable downing stations scattered around the countryside. On the seat between us are two little dogs. Tiny dogs eat so small I can close my thumb and index finger around their next. And one dog is on top and humping the other dog and she's looking up at me with big, small owl's goats are the огрates for the very crossroad. Joe was driving the car, but he has some backtribles and he can't really sit up high enough to see over the dashboard or the long hood of the car. Then he has the car in cruise control, so his feet are way back from the pedals, nowhere near the pedals, and it's  he's just acting  he's driving,  the car is floating down the road on a cloud. Joe tells me he... He was responsible for the creation of the Freedom of Information Act. He tells me he was the person who started the myth about getting high off smoking banana peels. He tells me he was the developer of the Stringlesh Yoyo, which he says in 1957, was the second best selling children's toy in America, right behind Kulhu. He tells me that there's more creative talent, the small Utah talent, than anywhere else he's been in the world. He's all creative talent in this valley for capital, than any. any place I have ever been on the planet earth. Anywhere. And it's still, it's got an innocence about it, which makes it beautiful blooming. It's not joineders to Hollywood in the August of Jones. We stopped by a mailbox and kind of a small white house. The mailbox says, Mike, just mine. Mike comes out of the house and gets in the back seat wearing a ball of kava ski mask, pulled down over his face, we're gonna rob a bank or something. We stay in the car for about an hour. Now her, Mike doesn't take the mask off. Mike is the television station's technical engineer and Joe's best friend. He's also the opposite of Joe in every way. Joe likes the talk and he likes to talk about himself and how he fits into the bigger picture of things. Mike almost never talks and when he does talks about flywheels, edit functions and video cassette recordings. Joe likes to be seen, no? Mike hives behind his back of the cover. Job has dogs, but he's actually much more  a cat himself. Mike has a cat, but he's actually much more  a dog himself. And so on. This way I can describe Mike to somebody is that he couldn't tell a lie if he wanted to. And I don't meet many people of that pure spirit, much in my life. Very rare. And when I meet somebody with that pure spirit, I want to nurture it and enjoy it and be around it. Because it'll never sell you short. It'll never be dishonest with you. So at one time, , you were associating hanging out with some of the most important people of the century. And now you live in Glenwood, Utah, hanging out with Mike. I think I have with my friend Mike. And he's very special. By 1954, the whole witch hunt communists was beginning to follow apart. Edward Armouro broadcast his famous ex-gozé, Joe McCarthy, and then McCarthy himself was investigated in the Army McCarthy hearings. McCarthy responded in part by turning up the heat on joke, asking him to supply names of writers and journalists who were comments or sympathizers. By this time, Joe was having second class. Being a paid performer had been  being a communist and then it had been fun for a while But then it got scary. He decided it was maybe time to come clean This is when Joe recognized Jesus Christ as his personal savior and was baptized in the form of church I took to it  a duck to water You get the woman church Wow Every Everything I wanted in my life in this gospel, in this lifestyle, and in the way the people were, in the caring for each other. And then my conscience really got the fuck me out. Here I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and I was living with all these misdeeds. And I finally said I gotta stop the fuck. And it's not black listing with my business. But I was a false witness, up front, all the way. Let it go. According to a friend of mine who is a wise man and also a good woman, there are three things you need to do in order to repair in order to achieve forgiveness. The first is you have to try not to do the bad thing again. The second is you have to try to compensate your victims. The third is you have to find some kind of peace with yourself. Love these three, the third is by Clark. most difficult to achieve. Job started with the first two things by visiting and apologizing to some of the people he'd named in front of the committees, people whose lives he'd run. He told them that he wanted to try to pay them back by writing a book about how he'd lie, made things up, book that would, hopefully bring down him, Cartier at once and for all. Then he asked each of them if they might want to put up some money to help get the book published. It's felt real good to go to people and ask for gifts. Where do you have them upset? Where do you have them upset? Where do you have them? , who was somebody saying, hey, look, I was an asshole. I was there, so I was there. And I'm sorry, and I shouldn't have done it. Please forgive me. And if you don't, I'm still asking you for gifts. And that's a good clean feeling. It's a rich feeling. It balances the body out, man. It really does. None of the men that Joe visited wanted to publish his book, however. Everything is right. She's understood by what I have been as an asshole. Love of all eternity is what I've mentioned in a book. To me that's just bad, nice letter for you. той kung fu's been once overtime. In this report, will you showess to himself he's afraid ofıyorsunfs She'd doubt the truth. He decided it was time to leave his old life behind and go to Utah, Mary and Warming Girl. He set off by walking hitchhiking across Texas, wearing German desert army fatigue, black boots, black beret, black beard, and a backpack full of old, testament puppets. At night, he'd stop at hospitals in small towns and ask if he could perform his puppet show up for the kids and exchange for a bed and something to eat. He traveled  this across Texas, into New York. Mexico, and in New Mexico he got a message from his mother. A public share in New York wanted him to write his book. Even though Joe was very close to a nice quiet life in Utah, he decided he had an obligation to set the record straight, so he went back to New York City. Coming up, trying to set the record straight, and because of it, ending up in prison. the most hated man in America. That's in a minute. Public Radio International. When our program continues. This is American Life of my Regardless. Each weekend a program of course which is a theme for you a variety of different kinds of stories on the theme. Today's program, people whose lives were pinned in history, caught up in huge historical events. And with the made of the Ractions, the years after the fact that it was quiet enough to make sense of anything. It's got to carry a story that Harvey Mutsu-san, Job Mutsu-san, Genius, Job. has moved back to New York, led to Red Book, the set-break history. The publisher was setting up with an apartment in Manhattan and a stenographer, and in four months, Joe dictated false witness. His book describing in detail how he'd lie and fabricated stories and how the government prosecutors had known he was lying and even participated in the process. In particular, he named Roy Kong, his old friend and government prosecutor, Trials, the communist leaders in New York. York and also in the Janks trial. In his book and also under oath in an half-a-davit, Job said that Cone had known that he was lying in the trials and had even encouraged him to do it. Cone denied everything. Even before the book was published, Job was called in front of some of the same committees he did. Here before as an expert witness, only now he was the accused. I am not an expert on the subject of Cone. The mind was not a leader in the Cone in the 40. I was a... I'm gonna splunk you in a 20-hole recidepnoo york. And just to lie that looked myself up into an expert on communism. And you expect me to start sounding up about what the communist fucking thinks and does. About what orders don't promote care with any. I was finally lit and out. Kicking all the shackles of the play act. I wasn't play active when I was just playing. I knew that we were gonna put me in jail, so what could they do? I knew I was played in the future, sir. Are you a- I'm not afraid of any truth, but you can get it, but I don't think there's any truth here about it. They were freaking out. , sour ones, cheap cash, and cheap pieces. Haven't you told yourself leader of the Communist Youth Movement? And I respond to- I lied! Everybody, laugh. You're a foul. Please give up the comment. You move when it is confirmed. My right! The other one is responsible for my wounds of this nut-eye. You're responsible. with  creating the fear and hysteria in this country. With people can't talk to one another. We're never can't talk to an neighbor without fear of being called a conscious. Your response will be hysteria. Wait for a few years, by creating a fear in this area in this country, which this country has never seen before. With people can't turn around and talk to their neighbors, without fear of being called a communist. I'm a decent people. You're the one who's responsible for my own legal business. Not I. ạties. I think when I wrote the book I was a little bit jealous of question from the beginning when you writing book. When that became part of my consciousness I knew my shewers got to the little apples. I was either in the assassin age of the book. I was perfect. And that part of me wanted to be a assassin. There would have been a great release finally. I wrote the book, I did the recantation. I straightened the record out and if somebody wants to blow me away and let you go home to God, I'll be home with my father, would have blessed him. This brings us up to the worst day of Job's life. The day he decided to call himself Job,  from the Bible. Only if you'll remember, the Job in the Bible was an innocent man, virtuous man, who suffered only because of a back God made of the devil. Whereas Job from Glenn with Utah is a man who through his own selfish desires, brought pain and suffering to a lot of people. In his book, Paul Swittons, published in 1955, Job compresses his sins and writes about how he was a bad man who's trying to repent. But when he tells the same story now in 1998, he sometimes describes the events as if he were a victim of circumstance, or at least that things were never black and white, and that he was simply. doing the best he could of long. 80% of the people who I named before the committee were cognizant, I had to be sure if that was the question I'd  them. What was wrong was that I was naming them at all? But at the same time I started to have a fantasy and based on the experiences I had in Europe that had the world珠. to many French Communists who tell me stories of how they repugnant as it was went to work for the SS, and they could stop them on the German authorities that occupied France. And they did so so they could spy on the Germans. And I used to fantasize, it was strictly a fantasy. And I don't want to give it any more credence than that. I went to the FBI and did to the FBI, with these people at that time to stop them. In the end, Job was sent to jail for perjury. When he got out after four years in 1961, he found work publishing avant-garde art books and helping to edit the East Billy Jother, which, according to Job, was the first underground newspaper in America. In the 60s and early 70s, he traveled to England, friend. and Australia , but everywhere he went, his past was right behind it. So I realized at that point that regardless of what I did, whatever accomplishment I may have, it's going to be attack and its foundations to be shipped away by the past people's view of and their perceptions of me and the credit. And at that point, I realized that I really didn't care about what they think anymore. Joe came back to the states in 19th. In 1973, and began to commit his life to serving others and doing the Lord's work as a sort of penance. He set up homeless shelters, soup kitchens in New York, Massachusetts, and collected used clothes and food that he drove out the South Dakota and delivered to the Sue Indies. He moved around a lot from one city to another, from one wife to another. He was  Chuck Conners in the TV show The Right Homeer, an officer in the U.S. Calvary who had somehow blacked out battle and deserved. to this man and was court martial. They broke the rifleman's savor and he was brand-scorned as a man who ran. Every week, the rifleman tried to redeem himself by saving lives and helping people out of trouble and by getting rid of the bad guys in the town. But he could never shake his pass. He could never even remember what had happened. In 1977, Job moved the Tucson, Arizona, where he fell in with the truth. troop of street musicians and performers that he managed and organized into the magic mouse theater, a nonviolent kid's TV show, our local public access TV station. Joe, of course, was the host of the program. Joe playing hockey booth clown. Cocky-boo is an old clown, dressed in rags that will once the clothes of a rich man, pop-ha, a texido coat. He's more scary than funny, and he's always trying to tell you something that he he should be able to understand. But he can. It all started a long, long time ago. It was in a faraway place close to the hearts of those knowing love. And it was a village called Angel Bay. Now if you were going to fast-dap, please you would see it. And the only way one could get to Angel Bay was to find a feeling with the Path's. Joe lives in the small Adobe house he caused the Gandhi Peace Center, a shelter for homeless man. The only homeless man here tonight seems to be Joe Petuso. His bedroom is also the production group for the TV station, and it's crammed with blinking VCRs and scattered video cassettes and various dust cover memory billion for the past. It's dinner time and Joe visiting on a sunken bed, feedy, spy, little dog. This is Mabel Holden and this is Mopsim Holden and this one is Busta Brown, the coolest dog in Doggy Town and they're my family. I  hanging out with dogs and people with disabilities. In order to achieve forgiveness, you must do three things. Of these three, the third finding peace with yourself is by far the most difficult. If you're able to do this, if you can find redemption, then when the bad thing you dig comes up again, memory or in conversation, it doesn't matter anything. Whether you are a victim of fate or whether you caused it all to happen by your own conscious actions, whether you are a victim. or just doing the best you could under the circumstances, or whether you were evil. When you've truly been forgiven, the bad thing doesn't happen effect on you anymore. It just goes right through you. Look, in the other room, I got a big picture of Roy Phones, with three foot by five foot, both grip of Roy Phones. Make what, and then he's who he gave it to me. Look at that, he's got it. And I put that picture of Roy Phones, that same picture when he died on the life first 1988. I start to see you coming. and I don't let his spirit go. Well, he's the man I should be hating for most of the world. He sent me to jail for five years. And he was a miserable human being to a lot of people. And there's a lot of harm. Much more than I ever did. And I should still pray that his big pictures up in my studio because I don't want to forget it. I can forget. Most enjoyable time I have in life right now, and sometimes I have to get in my car for 35 in the morning here. Sanca-Uta, drive 175 miles slowly city, still dark, get in the car with high amounts. When I get in the car, I have a prayer, and then I start to conjure up the spirit of every human being. I have ever known who has got spirit. I started with my parents, my brother with my parents, my grandparents, and then all the people I've ever known, I who've been sent it as your 44 uncles and aunts, my countless cousins, and then all the friends and people I've known in my life have not experienced. Job told me this story is house, he told me the same story in his car. But they take it quiet moment and I say to each one, good morning, I love you. And you're not forgotten. I've never told the story to anybody before. It's got this pacing that I've shared this for you. It's a very private thing. But I want to... ...state that when I think of all the people that means all the people I have to know... ...the Saints and the sinners. And sometimes especially the sinners.

This is the story about somebody who got Joe Matuso, a power of repeat the size. Thanks for your convergence of historical voices. But unlike Joe Matuso, this man made a decision about what he thought about his role, the in history, that's time to all happen. And he hasn't waved much of that sense.
