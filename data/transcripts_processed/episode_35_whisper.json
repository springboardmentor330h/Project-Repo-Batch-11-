This is American Life, my request. Today on our program, we clear out the inventory for Paul and Pastor's savings on the U. Over the last six months we have a commission on our program in number of stories and pound the numbers for us that we own over the radio staff blog. But have not been able to figure out a way to get into anything actually so. put on the air for you. That's the problem of working with a theme every week. And so we just thought we love these stories. You will love them. Let's just put them together. Get them on the air. In this hour act one. David Cederos. In the new. At two. High coup at the Scrimmage line. Stories from Stateria one perfect. Act three animal lovers. He's found writing. At four. Brand Ma and EZ. And a little bit of it that's something. a pro-promos saying that our search day was going to be about a high-doubt stand and ... a pro-promos about the high-doubt stand was not ready for you. It's not a tourist standards and so we are bringing you the program that we had planned for next week. Which is? Tomorrow's stories today. Say good bye. for taking a fun sleep The top onamento That's one You need So i Were You You You You nur You You There you You There you sore Talk to me You I'm back learn someone I try tourmha So we're gonna kick things up with the story from David Sidera as David is in, sometimes commentator and enters in the edition, a frequent contributor to this American life, author of the book, Barrel Bieber, he was working on a new book, the story is called The Nathan. And for the title story in that collection, he decided to spend a week at the Newspot. David is not something , excuse me, Nathan is. Brittany doesn't even  walking around the house of the airport, watching some a new name. challenge himself. During the summer he read a portion of the story, straining at a club called the AGB in the city. And as you can hear, this is Lisa just an anecdote. I'm a from a more large story. So before we start with warning, there is no sexiness. But there are references to specific parts of the story. One writer leave the thing thatever Just tell him to tell the story. that might not be possible. It is disconcerting to talk to someone on the phone and know that they are naked. Every now and then I might call a friend who says, you caught me on the way to the shower, but that's different. The man of the nudist colony sounded as though he had been naked for years. Even his voice was tan. Alright then, have you ever visited us before? No, will you ring? for a treat. I'd be happy to send you a pro-sour. Let me just get your information. And as apt as you may, I received my brochure along with a pamphlet, reads, body acceptance is the idea, mood recreation is playing. Bring your towels and sun tan lotion and relax with us. You will experience a freedom of movement that cannot be felt for most, to freedom to be yourself. The brochure pictures is swimming pool, playground, sun tan. and the inevitable volleyball, which leads me to wonder, what is it with these people and volleyball? The two go hand in hand, when I think new to start, I don't think he and I think met. Last night I was in a foul mood and her vote killed me to apply, gauding him until he fled the room, shouting, you're a pig, fat, and hairy pig. Biggest something I can remember. That is open to interpretation, but when coupled with hairy. against the former mental picture which is broadened to sharp focus and joined by the word PICK. A big, fat, hairy pig. If I were a nudist use words written in her heart and he said, would it accept me myself? Who I am? I thone the colony to make a reservation spoke to the same fellow with male misrosy. This time I could hear people in the background splash in yelling in their own way. The sound of the made me getty and I unbutton my slacks. The brochure had mentioned rental patterns and I was wondering what it might cause to stay for a week. You want to trail it for how long, years? Are we fast in my hands? A trail? I had pictured tree shaded bungalows, paneled and naughty pond. That to me is the essence of the word calling. This place instead was a Buddhist trailer for. We don't use the word calling anymore because... to spook. No, what we have are traitors. The smaller units won $30 a night, but it's one hero kitchen in Bath and the whole the option is double-worn, which will run your $10 more. He lost me way back. I was the word colony spook, if not the word trailer. Or even nudist for that matter. I can let you have the front badge you love the double-worn. That's not front bedrooms just to be evident to my back. I was told would be rented out separate. You might have one room or maybe it'll be a couple. Don't worry, you won't get lonely. A roommate at a new district. The combination of these elements presented as staggering tableau made all the more in-comprehensible when I heard the man shoulder the phone and raises voice. Shout mom, hey mom, where's the weekly price list for the two-bedroom rental trailer? This person was not always standard naked in part daylight. He was no any. I made my reservations and plan to arrive in one week. I called the park again today in Woman Ant. When asked if they provide cheats and pillows, she said, Yes, but no towels. Don't have to bring your own towels and go to pet me doing that. Letting you towels, no. I asked if the trailer's kitchen was pretty, she replied. Kind of. Seeing as I would be there for a week, I was hoping she might elaborate. I'm sorry. Well, . I have some things and not some others. Does it kind of have a stove and refrigerator? Oh, sure. There's a sink up there and probably some pans and so forth, but definitely no doubt. Who have the back-your-home because you can't be running back-of-board  that? We haven't got the time for that kind of thing. I told her I understood. Oh, I told you, but I think even I scrubbed your stack of towels up at the booth and I wrote rather useful. We don't do that. Not your folks, not anymore. Oh dear... Do your personal things, do your... to bring your own. I truly am. I'm the person I come in for a day and leave their towel behind by accident. But we put that towel in the loft and found but to get to go back a little bit more. You can't use those towels because they're not clean and they don't belong to you. That's somebody might come back one day to claim their towel. They wouldn't do good on the walking here and find you use them without their permission. They wouldn't be right. Nothing was lotion on my tail, go ahead and help you go back. Let it go. No. No. Go help them bring your. I underlined the word towels on my list of things to have and placed questions marks beside everything else. I arrived early on this cold and wet afternoon, cat-liver dumping me off in front of a clubhouse before squealing away. Something about the place seemed to make him nervous and he couldn't wait to get back into the tent. I collected my bag and entered a low, platform building where I'd fully dressed seeing me sitting to start hugging himself and gagging me. and watching the local news on a color television bolt, raw shell. On the screen, a weatherman was pointing to a map started the frowning plans. Cloud. Cloud. Cloud. On the screen, a weatherman was pointing to a map started with frowning sides. His arm position was if he were drawing a heavy curtain. The inhabitants of the room lean forward in their chairs, biting the ridges of her plants' fists and groaning and parking works cold from. And lay down a line. and booed the weatherman. They cursed him and then they pounded upon the table top so much  prisoners unhappy. The room was filled with the rhythmic thoughts of protest because I sat down my suitcase and closed my desk. He did this, some man said, warning his crooked finger in my direction. What is nastyness with him down from the legs? From the legs? The woman behind the counterhouse? The corners that were melt on some load, you crazy. find it on. She narrowed her eyes upon my ship, it's almost specifying to find it blasting across the floor. Actors was storm clouds, but she's lens. I don't know anything about any race. There was a rising panic in my boards. It was not sunny when I left this morning, really it was. It turned cold around the screen, but I didn't even get on the bus. It's true. It can have a stripe. It was ridiculous to stand before it was raining. Nine pipes are locked in the ground and I'm driving it the smallest. Anyway, let's go over to sleep together, add a rhyme Thank you for inviting us. YEARS 2 Well, it's the most clearer, but I'm more often in one of a dozen. So, we're fine, . Right there! That's your trailer there, orange trim. We need the one with the most common fans. You call it rocks, try saying it's orange. You can see the idea. It's the one with a picnic table on the front yard. Rock bet room, that's you. I'll feed myself the ants at first orange. But that said, rust and I don't want to bother. It only looks, rust and I don't know those clouds. You can see the rocks, rust and I don't want to bother. I'll sleep for a day, come and you'll see a torch. I'm sorry I can't just push up and we can't reach on each of our standouts. But I've got another thing. I asked where I might find a key to my trailer and turn around and pop a glass or something. Hey! We don't believe in locked doors, not here for them, not anymore. Maybe where you come from, people there are hidden doors, but here we have movies. We don't want... Oh, I know, because we have nothing to hide. I want that the gravel lane, my trail is sprayed so much except the side of the car, the tires were down. Raisin size flies  gasping on the counterpops. Their upturned legs signing words, get out of here! Ah! Why you still have a chance! Yeah! I set down my suitcase to play. The body passed the clubhouse, the stall had been falling. The same pool I had seen in the brochure was now covered by the floor. The side room, moving the flat and the side room. I woke this morning to a park so thick I couldn't see anything in the front window. From the sky to the ground everything was the exact same shade of bread. It was cold too, maybe in a low fit. Late last night my water shut off and it didn't even get any anticellated blocks morning. I got dressed in the clubhouse. for a spoke movie podcast, who are permits what you're in drank coconut for months. If you're air about the water there's nothing I can do. We operate in wells and sometimes they leak. If the top of something, they'll  it well. So what we do is shut down the pump around that time and turn it back on personally on morning. Today we got a late start. Most times back on by Seth LeBroso, Cameron. Didn't get back from his yoga class and told me to hate a clock and I can't even some a republic to remember saying, or help them fool themselves. not from the prefaceembill we were on a chair about no square alone I don't want to think about it on drink of my cocoa she reached beneath the counter and pulled out two marshmallows she stopped the gun if the waters out in your orange trailer you can always use the bathroom in the clubhouse all those the fog burned off slow by the clock was clear and sunny man looked out my window to see the naked couple just letting her cross the ground here of Dennis Burns the man was here long in the back and carried himself to address the blind system, describe competent and purposeful of woman's life behind the wearing design bars and the socks of students. These were the first active new to sciatine and put on my pants and cloth. Taking a seat beside the rebellion it could tend to read a book. The man had an ample stomach and a block didn't pass, it was jiggle, the sway was up and up before him. The tamting could be turned as far as the serves. They played for maybe five minutes before the man praised the sand on his wings. In least mouth full of fire on the grass and called the woods. They left the court and I followed them into the clubhouse and they asked that thing to bath with women's football for our hosties. He stood behind the couch. True! Look  you brought the last weather with you! Dennis Playwright! All that caught them is my sheet still the week for them, sadly you'll have lots of fun to play with. No number of little of you! I saw you just the window then. Haven't had a play or  you want to go to the long while! Why you all regular what's the name? I don't really have to grab them back to the gym and you saw it. Maybe junior, if you buy dollars. You're a good girl! I hope you and your all goldies stand for a while. I'll make you come to my place for some of the game of golfs. We're gonna be the only spin super cool fellow for yourself. Sure, I'm nearing up the sound. I heard the toilet flush in the man we entered the room. Bright red ring runs and... Here I thought it was a real mood. And I stared at him as though we just stepped down the blind sauce. There was a top for toilet paper just  hanging through his bottom. I'm gonna swipe. 20-thousand, the longest prize in casual and short. Is there or nothing more significant than your captain and his son? Oh yeah! Let's do a huge ad on us, I'm not going to buy a new bowling! Yeah, we run out of the whole place and I'll go to the toilet. Oh, I can't raise the rent, I'll just pull the way you get the damn me and bowl and bowl and I'll mop the bowl. Huh? Hold on, just a moment. You've got to sell some plain scents back to the house. Well, what do you want? Looking at my bedroom window, I could see the floor house in the parking room. Earlier today I watched the large trailer, marked with narrowing plates, and led by a four door lay-bob car. This was someone arriving to park their trailer in space for some. The car door opened and the door was locked and the door was locked. I guess he just couldn't wait. I spoke to a woman in the sauna who said, You should have been here for last year's pudding class. A big your pardon? Putting tools. I thought it must be some expression  sock off. Putting isn't conducive to being a horse, isn't it? Oh, now you can toss it. You just can't catch it. Yeah, what we do is we make it up and buy gallant hooks. We're not in the field. We have a chocolate team against the vanilla. And we just start. another hour, good time, good time, we can't do it this year, we're gonna try to do many things live, we're pretty much on the field for the next few months, but let's go, bye, Ashley, let's go. This is Sunday and looking out my window, I've noticed that a lot of people come to the new spot right after the church, I want to say stand beside your cars, moving. their sober suits and scripting all of your dresses. One of today's guests was a press material in Minnesota, a clerk, a fracophased man, that he thought that suit of sex. I've seen plenty of tattoos, but none have warranted kit for a black bag doll. He wore it with a swag or calling attention to a body part and wore it clearly not glass, but glass, but black or skin. The duct's beak was disdained and he appeared to be taking that a rash guard and enthusiasm. They're quite a few new faces today. A black man arrived in the company of two enormous white people whose bodies were doing masks and clothes. That spilled over their knees and the stomach fell  heavy saps. Legs  three talks, legs straight into sand, no men to the back, no stomach. She's a colored guy, but he's got two. So, you reckon he's one of those things to come down here for therapy? This was the only black person I seen all week, Marley time he laughed at me, and he started, what he did was kidnap me. He's gonna try to sell him this white slave from the cross-court or the Canada with a mimp, anything. I'm taking the joining the group of seniors and gathering a good interview, watch real girls disagree. What is this? Oh she's smart that way. It's an onset sage, a hearty color. Because they are dressed for on TV TV for remote movies. Oh, I'm just this shum. There would be so much better than it, right? I'm shing, they can take the money they spend on more of make-up, price-ful. I play the new version and make it up money to buy a big life. I  the amount. I  the idea, that if they only use that for the version... ... then 1- NBC Final... Do I have to be your cadmines when I was a kid? Due to the pleasant weather the targets were taken off the swing crew which is surrounded by comfortable refining chairs, several of them positioned beneath the sign and the cap part. It is supposed to be made inside the pool. Now I was just getting used to the idea when I was approached by a man named Gossi who would close when the piece sheet of certain card as correct as his sign box in order to the stand and chain of passes. The man was doubled over, stood with osteoporosis, his back sold as burners  fine Italian leather, fell white and black and sun. He wore a stick right here, cut clothes and his hand, favored me or sunglasses, black and white and white. I asked him a question about the hot tub, two hours later, he worked to sub-debt around the zone. I don't think that legally you're allowed. build a growth store in my name, because it's not zone for them. Oh, they're used to be a little common up-up-breach, we can buy bread and soda and so forth, but nothing goes down and dirty cool the church of the snake ends. You might put up an apartment building in my area, but first you have to check the city council because I'm not sure it's own plan. I'll be the one place to do what I want to put up. And I'm just taking these nice hopes, these red-based beds, but what was all this talk about building for them? Of course, down at the city, I guess you could build yourself an eight story concrete behind just along the way. I had to move a lot of pay everybody off. That's the way it goes down where you come from, anything for it out. Then you come up, you work your blue prints, your steam, shovels, thinking we're all a bunch of stupid hits. You're eating mud, widening his face, you're literally exactly green. And running the tip of his tongue, you're trapped in the strips. You just have to move up. Bumkins are we? Is that you, it was both helpful and awesome? was shared by many of the one that drew the first thing. Something about New York City, the wealthy, the wrong way. This was a family camp friend, New York was many of them, the place where whole families were shot down. Tonight was a scheduled hubo slum goole, and we were instructed to bring our hand vegetables to the pavilion by them. I took the only hand good in my pantry and carried it down the hill where I found two naked women wearing chef's hands, exploring the cold roof bread. I'm being water. Just pray nobody brings any more. You got to come and I don't know where God can have all the stones. I set down my can of corn and ask what they meant. And ask what they meant by hobos on boolean. It's a stew. This year is the face when we have whatever people bring to your taste. I don't know. Corn. Come five o'clock, walk, gather and dress  hobos. Meanwhile please head top here. It's fun, you'll see. Struck me as an odd choice for a theme party. You hardly ever were here the word hobo. To me, it always carried a romantic carnage. Now it's gonna be a place by the word homeless. Find you just  a homeless person. But be here by five o'clock, cause this is gonna happen to this. Are we turning to the Bavillion of the Schedule Time where 50 people sat eating out of peas? One man, it's me or something. charcoal on his cheeks. He wore a tie against his bare chest and carried a stick onto which he had passed in the plastic post bed. Everyone else was naked so he won the price.

So your favorite part was classified it. in yet, it's this very special and particular attitude. He records him sitting in his backyard, so it's because there's so anecdotal, it's actually quite clear that had a program that means what one of our regular shows, but the radio staff might work to do that. It's a program. It was between place, the coach was talking to the office, blind on schedule, reprimanding somebodyでした during the last room. We were standing around waiting. We were the deepens and we had no coach. We had three or four formations we've earned, but we never made a problem to the last minute. I remember because I made the calls. I was the monster man, the free sake, the captain for the deepens, and I thought I could call one formation as the offense broke out of him and then stand back and wait until everyone was sick. The quarterback going through his count and call another formation just so everything changed. shape right before the ball was snapped. This added the elements of surprise and chaos to our attack that made the Athens respect and fear us and often their place crumbled under the disorder we caused. I realized now I must have learned the strategy from my mother, who was at that time going crazy from a painful divorce. But there was this day, this practice I was talking about before when the coach was in the Athens portal. The sun is going down. and practice was coasting to an end. We, the higher in mighty mighty mountains, were standing around quiet and mines empty by 12-year-old Desperados waiting for a train. I was standing in a spacing out in everyone else and then I had this new feeling. I was conscious of being inside a shell by helmet and shoulder pads looking out at the world  my uniform and even my body were just protective packaging. I felt waitin' I was in love with the air, the snow of the grass, the warm light and cotton turns the edge of the field. I remember looking out at Bruce Seemme, our big defensive end, who'd already reached puberty. He had his helmet tipped up, and his hair was all sweaty, and his non-arms mouthpiece. He turned and looked at me, and I wanted to say to him, do you feel it? But I didn't know what it was. I didn't know how to explain what I was feeling. I called the Haru, and said, We're going to do something different this time. We'll line up in a regular 6-3 formation, but as they get set, I'm going to say a high coup. And I want you guys to start moving around, dancing around, standing on your head, do whatever you want. We'll kill them. The offense came out of their huddle, and we went into a 6-3. And just as the quarterback started this count, we go. The wind brings dry leaves, enough to build fire. And my defense stood up and looked at each other, and then looked at me. and didn't do anything. It was so weird that the often stood up too, and then the coach blew his whistle and y'all. What's going on? What's the problem? Nobody spoke. He wrote the means. Care? What are you doing? I said, we're running a high coup. I said, a what? A high coup? We learned it today in school. The wind brings dry leaves, enough to build a fire. Is it? Oh, great. , I cool. Just run a 6-3, okay? So, we ran a 6-3. I don't remember when I happened to have that. They come down from mountain and are not talking to each other. In the cold and in the base care, we'll go out for a mile and water is boiling for dinner. I'm making noodle soup and coconut tea.

But even when I brought the watch that happened right and turned over to the place in the mountains, there was looking down on the 5000 vertical feet, the one who was at the same river, they looked at you and you and you and you and you and you watched it from the road, as you remember not a thousand feet, and so on over the top of the mountain. Next morning, they decided to come back to these. and he's in one food, but there is no one food in his game. And there's so hunt and he's spirit. I think I eat it. But really, I think this is our eat, this is our eat, this is our eat, this is our eat. But I made it while we were caught. Did he? I tell him the story of this, that we had.

Apparently there's a difference between Zooif Ilya and Beastiality. That doesn't make the scared parents kind of push any of them. I don't know what well. There's a difference apparently, the people who are interpeasiality want to have a sense of a visibly love, and more people who are intersealed with their love are actually falling up, but they actually fall in love with the animal. Anyway, somebody up close to this to a human beings. The first time I ever heard of feasiality was in 12th grade. My future husband told me that the sexual fantasies about the animals, the time I was intrigued, reality was peaked. I wrote in my journal, I want to know what we want to do. and with what species. That's all about air and gave it into the densities of the stat, densities, and genie-team-team. Over the next several years, we had to be in the university, we didn't get there eventually, got married, and stopped frequently about animals, particularly horses, which we've always loved. We did not find the strange as love, as I love cats, and it could go with dog craze or whatever. The sexual aspect never wants to encourage me to speculate at home in Christ. Love, choose of them. practice with runes off the road to stare at a poor seat in quotes. But watching nature shows particularly the ones that show real meetings between the numbers in a certain panel and in the side. Because I'm a bit afraid myself sometimes. This thing goes on in a series. A human document, both of her denial and of what happened. As we could closer, he revealed other dreams and fantasies he had, some  dream for seeing lions and leading together one confirmed written out scream's and other statements being fitting behind the act of winding through votes. Welcome back to everyone on this page! They can't control what the mind does when they're asleep. Others are the tendency of us being courses struck me as odd, but not for the win-sane. Even the fact that he wanted to have sex with me on poor spec didn't seem to strange to me. And practical and comfortable, yes. Strange? No. He asked me if I thought having sex with an animal would constitute adultery. Is it good, man? Perhaps I was blind to something that was so out of question. I thought one of those people think, and only desperate people would ever have to resort to men alone. You're 20 teenagers, no other outlet, but really gruesome looking adults. I could not figure out why he was asking. She said he was curious. If I could tell the conversations  that sometimes, so I did not think this was anything special. I never thought it was odd that he would spend hours just visiting friends and on courses, I would run to the race track as well. them, we're going to the races, we never heading, we're biking from miles, just to see, just to go to a farm, and for a side there. When he said he couldn't see but night, when I, I meant a very good one. When he said he couldn't sleep in the night and would go for walks into a two morning I worried about him but never once thought he was in his tent hop to track and make a stallion who's a new boyfriend. He said he worried about school and work for us. Anyway, let's talk to him about how they got an internet connection. He starts signing on to these groups with a disgustiness on the net. She said in Karen released what he read but he started getting great Karen on it with how my walk by the computer. Stay up late night, tell her in pictures in the net got to see, pretty soon. and never got to read. We began snapping each other. Those angry videos always meant ignoring me. Those angry because I wouldn't did many quote, quite a thing. Three acres wanted on and finally, she tells her, she can find some, says don't hide this from me. And then he said the sentence that changed her voice, she wrote. I mean, I haven't done papop, but some of those people have done. Dillon, I asked, oh my god, open mouth and search for it. The laughter himself and hung his head with. and totally lost and defeated and it means to tell you that in that, you started to cry. I thought it was getting bloody almost a gibberish. They wonder how stupid things make one. Doesn't make one me? Why? Why? Why? Why? Then she goes on explaining that to a few years and all she's learned and she's , I'm for him. And then she says, in a way, people go to other experiences and have these things that I wanted to cry and thought so close to him, because it was a very told me, so I finally knew. She says that in Rot, she went to the letter. Anyway, she goes on to say, as she's come to Kesa, they're talking about other people. I'm talking to other people who have these desires. She says, I'm looking at what to realize there was so much diversity in the world. I'm very glad they had the opportunity to find out, plus it with Anton Didd. the A that breaks his wedding bells every time he's with Nannmore. It's not as if he had ever been with me for a horse. He told me that what he feels for the horse is totally different from what he thinks for me. The horse was going to spiritual void that I cannot. Well, I am saddened by the fact that I cannot, they're all of his needs. In fact, I don't, they're all of his needs. I come to realize the trouble for a zoo or power friends. There is no way for anyone to be all things to him. For it's not anyone. I have it. So you don't have to write equipment to the Italian for now. Brilliant. This coming out actually made our marriage better since I've been used to go to the Grades of Custer, even hearing what he had done with the animals may mean to a closer to him since the viewer, a part of my hidden knowledge is just it. He has told me that if I force him to choose to pick me in an instant, I hope I never get that pity. Did he enough to force him into a twice in a half? Congratulations, according to ipsk ee am bing I'm running straight on the saddle He sits upon his grave and horse Her name is Whitney She don't love me She's got a lot to talk to you in the Ontario society so happy to be all kind of true family people that's cool when I was a little girl I thought my grandmother choosing some each I really did my mother Bonnie was a question called career girl and after she and my father separated I was left with my grandparents five years in my child Pramidazel stumbled into this next story after whom. And to get to the story I think really interesting, humor. Pramid is from Texas, and the person who shows closest with his child is a grandmother, who she ignored and he ignored her. And the grandma's house is always order-weaning, who versus the chaos of Pramid's parents' house. If you use a girl, Carmen put together a little documentary, about her grandma Tuesday, who is in a nursing home, and not to happen about it. And in the documentary. she talked to the grandmother about Peppain and asked, and she remembered what was  growing up and viable about Christian Grandma. Sundies were always problems with me. When I was little of living, I heard dreadful and boring services. In the way all the ladies greeted me and asked me if I could nap time, washed the blood of lambs. Ze孩 was thevid at 10 degrees añ shattered during the day. of the 20 papers, even the grandma who said, Devil's Black, when I ignored the church girl for granted, six blocks away. And of course, the civil rights issues suddenly made you aware that they were no black and not church. Even though we had to drive from a poor black neighbouring to get to the brush away my questions by telling the fellow folks in their own way of worship, and that they wouldn't enjoy the white properised magic services. Can you hear that? Yeah. Can you hear what they're singing? Oh, what are they singing? Swing of the chair and very little. Do you  it? Very good. Now, I need to have that face up. What? Where are you? all those elderly people have been completely set. Damn hell and God, rewards can never be used to my friend and his house. Never. Nigger though, that was a word nobody seemed to mind. The damn niggers were getting too big for their bridges. They were getting sass, horseball. They wanted to sit next to you on the bus and at the World War Slamish counter. I heard this kind of talk my whole life in my grandmother. begin to sink in until we couldn't get an ocean view of using a park we want, as they said, me and her sweet. Meanwhile, my father, who thought too easy was crazy as a bed bug and I was just her, was running for school board on a platform of integration, from our Texas school system. He and my mother joined Unitarian Church, which recording my grandmother were a bunch of demons, and tensioned between my two families. A more parent, terrible piece.
