We used to read the vocabulary pattern when it first came out and we made curtains. Very powder curtains. And  they have  no curtains now and I look back at them and I'm  wow, , it's changed. I wish you were still there. This is Kegel Hernandez, in seventh grade at the last school here in Chicago. She says that she actually visits her fifth grade classroom, room 211, and her fifth grade teacher Mrs. Chan, fairly often, and reminisces about the past. Recently, I went through the shows and the books are still there , are America? It's  the book, are America. Yeah, , reminiscing about  when we read that book and how it, it, sure. That's a racism. Back in the thread, she covered a copy of the book with one of those paper book covers with a picture of insane fun it. It was her copy that then I'd rather write her name and find the books at her school. They had numbers and my number of white people said 30. So you did find book them 30? Yeah. I thought book and it was just there without a paperback cover and  everything that was mine is not mine and I think  that's the hardest thing from switching to another grade. And to another classroom and to another teacher. There's no environments in new different things to learn. Well, old memories to leave behind. 20 years from now, 30 years from now. When you try to remember back to seventh grade, what do you think you're going to remember from this year? I think I'll remember it. Barely. Isn't that fun to strain? So to think that you're going through all these experiences now that somehow are going to get wiped off the blackboard? Yeah, but I even have that experience now. I can't remember things from  second grade. I see  some things  I remember this kid. He wrote this Valentine card from his  your pretty as a world. I don't know something  that. But I can't remember teachers really well  I used to. He does that but then he does that okay. I do that about that because  it would be... It's a part of me, it's , you don't even remember what's happened. It's kind of hard because it's been a part of you. When I asked Pegal, which friends did she wouldn't remember it all someday? It wasn't hard for her dance. Cynthia, I probably should get them. And Lene, I probably should get Diana and Maria. I'll forget them. And... So, do you often get a whole bunch of people? She's not close to these kids or anything, but as she said their names, it was  watching them vaporize or something. Some day they'd just be gone. Erase from the history of her life,  they had never been there in the first place. We forget most of everything. And then, sometimes we go back and try to remember. And really, there is no predicting which people and places and moments will be able to get that. They aren't in Maria. They could still make the cut. Well. From WB Easy Chicago and Public Radio International, it's a American life, I'm our class. Today on our program, return to childhood, what you find and what you do not find when you go back. Our show today in 4 acts, act one, once more with feeling, in which Jonathan Katz answers the age of question. What happens if you return to your childhood home and it's not so nice, and the current owner tries to sell it to you, back to punk, integrate, flannel suit, watch a mortgage-back. discovers that his old punk band from the 70s is hot in Japan. It decides to leave corporate life for a little bit and go back on tour. Factory, each being in my head. A 34-year-old man investigates who he was at nine years old and learns a thing or two that he would just assume not remember. At four, every day I forget something else. A 10-year-old explains memory with the help of novelist Nicholas and Baker. Stay with us. That one. One more with dealing. You may have heard of the series on public radio, caught lost and found sound, which looks for old tapes put on the radio. But one of the producers who works with that series, Valerie Vilarty, new a man named Jonathan Katz, who loves old tapes. Loss and so much that he says that it just puts him in a good mood just to be around audio equipment. Naturally, they got in touch. Katz. There's also a kind of minor celebrity in his own right who did a TV series for a while about a cartoon psychiatrist called Dr. Cats. Anyway, Boston found sound at Cats sit down with another one of their producers, and in J-Alson, to play some of these old tapes of Cats' family. And after they did that, Cats went into his little journey into his childhood and stepped further. But I'm getting heard of this story. Here's a few minutes first. I've been going through his old childhood tapes and J-Alson. on, and do a some serious time travel, okay.... your email. The TV would be on it's kind of sad Can you kid believe what this? Now it gives me great pleasure on behalf of our entire congregation To express our very good wishes Mr. Sidney R. Kats and to Mrs. Kats. Upon the barmits for this morning of their son, Jonathan. The 10,000 of the plans of Israel. That's me. Verily, I give you good doctor. I said, Verily. Not my teacher. Bring us back to thee. Alone. We will return. We knew our one day is as a boat. There's somebody. I have a Yoke accent in Hebrew. Pretty tough. I'm totally dead my HBO special. This is the most money I've ever got paid to perform live. I'm bored. Let me move her to head a little bit just when we're sure. Well, that's all I think. I'm going to leave her to get free. I'm going to tell her to have fun. I have no idea. What can I do with this? Behind me. Okay, let's get this to you, okay? Oh man. I have no change one bit. That's what life was  in my house. We were the ones who really take the nipples watch what we just did. I have the subnoxious habit now with my daughter and her friends, both daughters. We can just be sitting around with a bunch of friends, and I walk in the other tip. going to go, okay, talent show. what you have this 17. It's pretty uncomfortable. John, I think has joined us from this poem studio in Boston. John, are you in the home? I'm taking the interview. Over the course of the week. Talent show. , I pretty much am always well in the country. before it is something we are listening to something I'm surrounded by my past and audio tape See how many hours of tape you have there in your house I have a say, , and it's very hard for me to give it accurate as a rip it I would say 5,000 hours And how much of it have you actually found that? Well, if I'm sitting in my office in my house writing something Reverend going downstairs and having a cup of coffee or put on the mold wheel to take a cigarette for him Let's play one of the recent recordings you've made. Okay. Now I want to see a picture hanging in the wall just reminds me of what could have been. Same in the glass that I was gonna say. Yeah. And I still hope maybe someday we can get together. See what we need. And make up for lost time. So what we need. And thank you all the way. We will Fly Down. Cruz Me. Thinking of survival. You stay! It's not a subject for a song to sing with your own hero daughter. Yeah, but I mean you could... It feels on the bus go round around only so many times. ? Hey! I'm  a break! You and her love! After the gap, there's all tapes and talking about them. And decided to get together with your sister, fill us in the turn. into your childhood home in Brooklyn and it was a cheap set day. The sheep said they was what we lived. My early childhood memories were for a house and sheep said they. And how long had it been since you did that? I don't think it'd been there since the 1950s. Wow. It was a dirt road or as summer was in now. Yep. A part of Brooklyn was a dirt road in the 1950s. It's true. We lived on a dirt road. Don't we turn right at every one in Brooklyn? Just explain the setup in the car when you went back to book on who was there. I was driving with my sister Phyllis and Nangeria. I'm Marilyn Mayburne and I've done whatever happened in the West. So you drove back to the old neighborhood and moved up to a series of different houses that we lived in. What was it  to knock on these doors of these different houses trying to talk you away in? I used that one's fun and I think ... I think Phil was sort of a distorted view of my celebrity. That was that it was going to be in the press people the fact that I used to be a cartoon. Right, you said a one person after another, I used to have this TV show. Yeah, not a one of them seems to watch that show. No. Oh, wait a shot. I'm trying to get some news to the audience. I have a TV show back in past I'm in the movie. And I'm here when my sister Ferris sent me an 100% for his film. Or maybe fake me having the fuck who my f****. Okay, sorry, I guess the most amazing was the sky of the alien street when he announced that he couldn't let us in because he's on an international call. Right now, it seems so arcane. Yeah. he was the first person to make contact with somebody from another country on phone. Yeah. Oh, yes. Hi. , my international call. So please be quick. What is this a night? I mean, it's  six and we have to see the apartment. I'm speaking to my wife on Switzerland. I'm back. Where did they cost? Yeah, cost. So we got a debt. Good. Good. Good. Every college, so we can ask your local friends. Yeah. It's nothing to show off if that's his way. We finally get into one of the houses. Would there be a private view that was surprised that, in some end. some way that other people were living in the house. I expected to see how I furniture an oddly enough my parents. What who were worried sick were who'd been. But of course in a way, because that's the way it looked the last time we were there. Right. Ex sort of think of my home using book on especially as the sets of sick homes. Another defosal time. Yeah. But instead. and he's kind of... kind of mendous. And the recently led us in it, it wasn't the sentimentality, it's out of its un-democratic forehomes, the 400-in-30-9 thousand dollars, and it's a dumb. He was very hospitable, he chose to remove in a room where we... first and I shared a room that's where we moved to Manhattan. But so, the first... We lived in this... In the summer, when we were... We were... We were... We were... when we got locked in, should we have a theory? Yeah, we got locked in the bathroom and had to call a fire department. Yeah, that's all that, huh? You remember to disclose your orders, customer, for you? Let's talk about how you got all of the sister on this trip. I want to play with you, please. We just passed her old school. There's a house similar to this, my little stuff. Did I just go there? There was one thirdy, but you wouldn't really be there. Did I go there on the way there? Yeah, maybe. Because you said that, over these two. She's how is it? Beautiful, private houses here are not there. , I think if you dissect the dialogue, you can see that with neither of us are really taking in what the other person is saying. And I'm pretty much back in the jokes, but I'm not sure she hears anything, forget her dancing. Where's the theaters? It's so weird. Give me the how much she is to cost. Really understand. It was your intention to look younger and play a sexual way from this. We're very competitive and especially about our past. It's almost  a revisionist. , she wants perversion of the past to be the one that's pursued is a truth. What's it if it's a shame about your sister's version of the past and your version of the past? I believe that there was a certain amount. No, I sense it, her version. The big difference was that she and I got along only with kids. She thinks she's at you that a long time. Yeah. She thinks that we were a happy family when I think we were. I wonder if it's just that she was happy? That's possible. It's the most submissive interpretation. I expect to define some evidence. happy childhood. What effect I couldn't really get along with my sister? it's so strange about about this fifth-year-old back in neighborhood is you're really dealing with the most potent psychological material possible. you're going back to the place where you grew up you haven't been there in decades. You think you would bring back a flood of memories and feelings and  and nothing happens. It is odd. Well, , it's a little bit  this TV show that made me, and I'm not trying to change the subject. I did a TV show recently about it was called Alpha Force. And the premise was that it was six guys living in a bunker underneath the Utah. All specialists in some field, I would have left contact specialists and we were set up by the government to do covert operations in front of the countries. Yeah. No. Ah. Ha. Right? You're Killing B. Hello? Have you seen it? Did you guys think that it's then silk? Yeah. Yeah, it's not. I don't do it that way. I just think I think that what's really bad it's actually its own tool. Maybe it's something that I kind of . I love it. Sounds  it would turn into but just in the bunker no one's calling. So why suggest we start a book club? And that's kind of where we are now at this piece. Okay. Do you think what you wanted out of that to be true back home? No. What do you want? You said earlier. hard for your working clothes, just some sign that of about whether things were happy when you were here. What would you hurt on these tapes or scenes? , never had that. , if I had been able to rip away the wallpaper house and see the words written by me, sweet guy, life is so good. I mean, I, I look at my, my 18 year old. and I guess that's the feeling of looking for. When you look back at this note, , I'm looking for evidence and I too used to be at happy one. , it's looking at a black and white photograph of that house with my father. And my mother and me and my cousins and my sister sitting on the steps might be more potent than actually sitting on those steps. The community in Jonathan can't. I can still recall. I can still recall. Back to Punk and a great final suit. David Philp is the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills. As you might imagine in Beverly Hills the handle rather large mortgages. He dresses neatly and beautiful clothes his clean cut hair. But in the 1970s in his native England he was in a punk band called The Automatics, which was never really a big commercial success. But no. and respected in the history of the Pugminton there by people who care about these kinds of things. And last year through an art set of connections, he ended up revisiting his teenage years. For the first time, by going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan. Here's how something  that happens. I mentioned it to a client, and I said, well, , I played in a Pugminton, when I was a kid. And he said, well, really, he's interested in, and then the next day. He sent me a copy of a new bay auction and said, is this you? And I saw what, so it was, and I'd watch this auction, and I'd watch this some price shoot through the rules, , and then I began to realise, wait a minute, I'm collectible. Let's get down to breast hair here. How much will you get? I think that one actually went at $48. I'd particularly  looking at, , all those with, other groups that were going to 25 cents. Music business offerings along punk lines that I thought were low low nonsense at the time and it was good to see that their records weren't valued here. So later I mean it was it was that history came out on the red summit. Yes, that there is a sort of Darwinism A in the Reckled Collective. What happened there? I went to see Ricky, the drummer, and Ricky collected it. And he very kindly lent me these two scrapbooks. So I took pictures and things out of there. I just put it up on a, had a friend put it up on the website. And then I got an email from Feecy in Japan saying, I'll try to tell you in Japanese punk rockettes. and a name of a person. Yes. And your record changed my life. Well, and you found out through the website that there was an envelope sound. So he asked, , if he could put in touch with Toshio Jima of bass records, which was struck up a deal. And then they said, well, would you come over here and play some gigs to, , promote? So you go to tour it, how old are you with that one? 45 years old. A little bit of great here coming in. A little bit of great here coming in. And I really wasn't sure whether , I'd still be able to do it. So I hadn't played those songs in 22 years. . not in my shower, not to anyone. I mean, prior to being married, I mean, I remember dating women for a year who never knew that I'd played. I'd ever played. It wouldn't even come up. Wouldn't come up really, I mean, I'd have a guitar hang around, but lots of other guys did too. Would you ever pick a guitar and play through yourself? Yes. I wrote a lot of songs for my dog during this period. Can I hear a DVD? rière. The titles would be, we're going to the park with some big favourites. To be followed by that hit, who's a good boy? Oh, what a good boy, actually. It is. What a lot of good boy. So, we went over there, October the 6th took my wife, which possibly was a mischief. What was a mischief? population but no it's a good thing to take my wife because you're approached by dozens of teenage girls I was getting stopped on the street so what happened the first day you went on stage well there was just  the announcement the light and sort of a moment science which lasted forever and then sort of out At the back I heard the opening wrist when the tanks were low the pole and there was just this whole ignition of energy from the club and front and all these kids just started going mad and it just clicked right in. The felt  I was in an automatic cover band or something  that because it was so long ago I didn't feel that association as the writer because I wrote material and all that I didn't have that association as the writer anymore. See, but I would wonder if as you sing the songs, the conviction of the writing returns to you and you remember of the feelings of it. Did that happen? It was a muscle memory, it was there, , the movements are all locked. in the lyric and the beef and the parts. And as I played them, they all started to come out. It was just  being a marionette or something. , here you punch the egg,  what they, , sort of bring it, , remind the drama to come down and, , they point at the guitarist for the solo. , you forgot in the thrill of being on stage. Yes. I forgot. What it was to have the audience right there. Before this had you ever performed at Hongshou, sober? Never. Well, unless I was taking the anti-biotics. But it's not in the same way. So much information. It's such a brief sentence. No, it actually was one of the great paradoxes really, I suppose, that was great to do it same way. Whether I'm at a stage where you felt your age, we just, towards the end, you really feel yourself. , because it's  a sauna up there. I mean, it's so much energy going around and, , it's louder than bombs. No, I'm not gonna let it go. No, I'm not gonna let it go. So your wife had never seen you do this before. There must have been a part of you which felt so pleased that she could see her. Yes. I felt kind of , , I'd become this other person. And when I was over there, my life over here seems to have us sort of almost re-mine substance. And then, of course, seems  I'll back. The events. in October and Japan just began to assume that sort of mantle of green. I did three shows two in Tokyo and one Kyoto and after it just just great. In Kyoto we set a... Black record for the largest attendance ever. It was so packed we couldn't actually get off stage. The only way out was over. I had to sling myself over the orders and they carried me on their hands back through the crowd and generally deposited me the stage dorm. So this is your last gig that was your last gig? Yes. And it ended with the entire audience lifting you up and passing you bodily out and it ended on object. you out of the club? Well, not out of the club, but to the stage door, yes. It was amazing. And then they have a really good mood by a mob of teenagers and people in the 20s. And what exactly is that ? Well, in Kyoto, I felt pretty good about it. I'm not sure how I would have felt about it. In London in 1970, the scene was incredibly violent. Whenever you played, you were just as likely to get beaten up and now you're still out of the club. I describe what it was  to come back after the toilet It was hard for me to get motivated again to do my business after the After the tour It just wasn't as thrilling as being on a stage in front of cheering well not many things are And it's a bit  some of ,  my dad's generation  after sort of  growing up ASAT kid, , being fired on and in, , World War II and all that kind of stuff. It was kind of hard getting it up for, , working at the shipping in the shipping industry again. Shortly after I got back Steve Lillie-Wike was in town. And that is, he was the original producer and he was also my roommate at the time. all the automatic stuff was going on. And now he's incredibly successful with us, not YouTube, Dave Matthews and all that stuff. And anyway he was in town, he had some time and so we hung out together for a couple of days and Hunter was off. And so, yes, Hunter, I want to. So, , we got to hang out and we talked a little about the old days and he told me, , big Paul from specs does catering in. And Nigel from the Menbers is not Australia now and Walter from the heartbreakers. He's a stop broker and man of hand. So it was, I think I got to see, we don't get what we deserve. We get what we get and we have to be okay with that. — Did it feel... — David felt? — We'd sing ourverted…. The Maddox that he has not quit his day job. He has been recording in the studio lately and hoaxed the tour Germany in the fall. Why is it that the Axis Powers are the ones who are going for this music what right now? What is that about? Coming up, a famous novelist and actress from the TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the impossibility of time and memory and a babysitter, its action action action, believe me in just one minute on Public Radio International, when our program continues. To American Rifle America Glass, each are going to program of course we choose some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, return to childhood, stories of people revisiting the past, what they find there, what they do not find here. We have arrived at Act 3 of our show, and this act is a story of how one of the producers of this program made a decision to return to his childhood. At Expoomberg when searching, for somebody named Susan Jordan. through he and his sister Kate and her parents knew for about a year when he was growing up in Cincinnati. These are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan. Me and her sitting in the background and telling about the day camp I went to that summer. I can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes. I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the council had to catch it and on and on  that. Me and Susan flipping through one of his time life books. Rack and all of it. the decades, the sixties. She is long brown hair, she's incredibly skinny. It's 1975, she's wearing bell bottom Levi's, a faded gene jacket. She points to a picture of a bloated man in a powder blue rhinestone jumpsuit, sitting cross-legged on a stage before a crowd of crying women. That's my favorite picture of Elvis Sheezes. This information seems somehow personal and important . Meansu is in writing in her car. I'm going through this phase when I'm trying to notice things. So when we popped to a stoplight, I start trying to notice the guy on the motorcycle next to us. The apparently doesn't want to be noticed, especially by a peculiar nine-year-old staring at him through the passenger window. What are you looking at these years? I turn around, fast, and face the dashboard. Did he say something to you? Susan asks. What did he say to you? Nothing. He didn't say anything. It's fine. Look Greenlight. Tell me what he said. What did he say to you? I say silent. I know if I tell everybody. said, she'll get out of the car and try to kick his ass, which scares me, but comforts me too. Susan Jordan was our babysitter. She watched my sister in me every day after school for a couple hours until her parents got home from work. We didn't know any adults  her and we loved her. The summer before I started fifth grade after being with us for a year, Susan got another job. The last time I saw I was a Christmas Eve in 1982. I'm 16, cashier at thrifley foods, supermarket and Cincinnati where I live. The places packed, all 25 registers are going. People lined up halfway to the back of the store. I look up and this is Jordan. She smiles, we talk. She doesn't have many items, so I checked them through as slow as I possibly can. I can't recall one thing we say to each other. Hello? I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's marrying. She has me some kind of business current. Her husband's probably. Something having to do with the building redwood decks. She seems happy. Meanwhile, there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her. They tell her to hold on. I'll try to get my break. We can catch up. She says great and steps aside. I keep signaling to my manager, but there's no one to relieve me. Five, ten, fifteen minutes pass. I keep glancing behind her, so you can make it. apologetic gestures. I can still remember her standing there holding her one bag of groceries, smiling back of me. Finally, she touched me in the shoulder. I have to go as she says, but I come in here all the time. I'm sure I'll see you around. I worked at Tricle for two more years. I never saw Susan Gordon again. The dress would be crazy that I know her again. If I hadn't run into her at the store, I don't think I care. If somehow, having a play with the missing  a huge role in my life when I was a kid, and then getting just a taste of what it would be  to talk with her as a peer, I've never forgotten that much. I know it's ridiculous, but after years of thinking better, imagining what you have to, wondering if she ever thinks about me, I decide to find her. I start with my own. the one former employer of hers that I know. Hi, Mom. Hi, Alex. Do you want to know I'm calling? I do, I do. You remember Susan Jordan, right? Susan Jordan. Susan? She worked. Yes, bringing her a valve, but I can't place it. , she was our babysitter. Oh. Oh, okay. Chicken leg. in my pet. One of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname. I think that's all I want to say about chicken legs in my pet. I've gone to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan, but she didn't remember much more than I did. She was that babysitter that really had the floor of a relationship with YouTube, and she did with her. She seems to have a very meaningful relationship with you. You almost the kind of relationship that you might have with another adult. That was about the extent of it since she never stayed around when I came home. She was out of there. We're talking to my mom, did do. It was make me look at my childhood memories from an adult perspective. for example, what I remembered about her living situation. I didn't get there. I'm pressured that she was close to her family. I got the impression that she's very much out on her own, very, very young. I think she must have been in the process of breaking with her own parents during that time. That's, that's, yeah, see, that's, that my memory is that, , of , she was in high school, right? She went to witness it. But I also remember her living on her, for some of that, I remember her own house. Yeah. And the reason I thought that she lived by herself was we went to some we went to her house or her boyfriend we had to go pick something up somewhere and we were in her car this big blue duster I think there was and her boyfriend was there and her and her boyfriend let cats out and there they were gone and she was furious and I got in the car and then she looks lamb the door and I think we peeled out and he was sort of standing  who's sort of standing there and saying trying to reason it there and we were out of there. What did you say? Did maybe I think I felt sad for her? I remember thinking this is sort of in retrospect, but I think I had some sort of inkling at this idea at the time and just sort of now realizing it. But I think... I remember thinking that he was one of the few people that she had in her life and she could move in really the time on him. Yeah, you were probably right. She was a scholar. Mm-hmm. You... you... They have been at that point at that moment her only friend, ? My mom didn't have any idea where I could find Susan, which made things difficult, because a Susan Jordan is a very common name, and b, which probably not a name anymore. I called the County Court Records Department to find other Susan Jordan's marries in Sonati. My mom asked a friend who worked for the city to search other Cincinnati birth records. I contacted high school alumni associations, asked friends at high-powered newspapers to run background checks. Finally, there was one former Susan Jordan who stood out. She seemed the right age, she was married, living at a Cincinnati suburb. She had a couple of kids, her husband was a lawyer. I got her number from information, and it wasn't until I sat down the collar that it hit me. A phone call from someone you babysat 20 years ago might not be a welcome surprise. but in fact strange and creepy. Here I am practicing sounding benign. One, two, one, two. Susan, is this Susan Jordan? Is this Susan Jordan? Shh. Finally, I made the call. Hello. Hello. Hi, is this Susan? Yeah. Hi, my name's Alex Bloomberg. And I'm... I'm calling from a radio program called this American Life. And this is a private strange phone call to receive, but I was wondering, first of all, do you remember me? It turns out there are a lot of Susan Jordan so you don't remember me. A lot. One guy even called his ex-wife, a former Susan Jordan, and then called me back to tell me she never heard of me. I was getting nowhere by myself. So I contacted her professional. One Irving Bot when I certified New York City Private Investigator three days after putting him on the case I got a message saying he found her I called him back I called this morning early roughly around 7.30 I should get morning I  to do myself. I should My name is Charlie Sol and my life is part of the getter. You walk and I'm looking for someone I used to live in Cincinnati and went to a private school there and the time which is in short. She said that's the, I said okay and I said I don't know anybody named Alex Wumber right away. I babysat her. And the interesting part about the whole thing is she definitely likes you, remember you and she's gonna call you. Hello, is this Susan? Yeah. This is Alex Bloomberg. Hi Alex, I'm Sue. I'm Turingoke. How are you? I'm just gonna get my email. I got your email. Yeah. I talked to her at work. Susan and I talked for over three hours in the home. Catching up, comparing notes. She asked about my sister and kids that used to live in the street. And our old family got. I'm Turingoke. I'm Dio. It was amazing how much she remembered. And how much we remembered in the comment. Even small incidents. the time that we were stopped at the traffic light. And I stared too long. if you guy on the motorcycle. I think I remember that on the area of the new? Probably. Probably. And he said did he say something to you? And I said no, he didn't say anything to me. And he said, he said something to you. Didn't, and you were about to get out of the car and pick that guy as I'm sure. I think I can remember your face. I think you were sitting very still with your hands in your lap. Were you afraid? I was terrified. I didn't know that he would notice me. But ... What's going on? I would have taken it now. I had no fear. I'm telling you. You remember a time? , it was  maybe six or seven or eight years FB babysat us. And I was worried. Yeah. I remember. I remember. I guess you were you bagging my groceries, but I didn't recognize you. I don't. And you told me who you were and then I did. Right. Right. I think you said mop head. I did. I did warp you. The people still call you that. Susan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company as a repair person. She spent the next 20 years or so hanging from a telephone pole she said. She hated it but the money was good. Around the time her first marriage ended, she finally got up the courage to quit and find work using her degree. She now teaches at a special school for mentally ill children. She lives in Florida with her second husband and she seems happy. Of course when you dive back into the past  this, you find how pass it. and incomplete memory is. First they're the facts you get wrong. Turns out Susan had been a college freshman when she babysat us, not in high school  I thought. My sister remembered she'd ridden the motorcycle, also not true. And the guy who she got in the fight with her with the cats, her mind-lined was her hairy 70s boyfriend, turned out to be her roommate's boyfriend. But besides the facts you change, they're the facts you completely omit. That fight over the cats? Susan had forgotten totally that I've been there. And it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she forgot. Other details she remembered fine, even the names of the cats themselves. Awesome and tall. We were Hillbilly, you remember? Good. And I can't imagine what I took you over there for. I'm sure it was for nothing, we were just running errands. There's the lucky. It's funny because when I, , I remember these very people are incidents. And that was one of them and probably the reason I remember it is because it seemed very significant to you. I think I sensed as a kid that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point and you can trust. Oh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved there. I had no family wrong. I'll let's see. I'm moved. out the day I graduated from high school. I was 17 because I started a year early. I had I just wanted out. I found out that I got scholarship. I packed up that night. Why do you want to get out of bed? Because my family was dysfunctional. But my mom and it was pretty bad. The girl that I lived with, at that time she was taking a lot of drugs. And her boyfriend, and every time I would come home, they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something. And I really didn't do it much at all. And it was really, it was tough to come home. I guess I'm not scared enough for a little bit. I really missed my little brothers and my little sister, and they were caught. I guess maybe trying to substitute. I think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember you so fond that was because I think it worked both ways. I think that we felt that didn't make you so close to us. I think we responded. Well, I was desperate. I guess I was looking for a family. But I mean, it's only you knew. You probably wouldn't know how to make it. But I mean, it people are complicated. Now what I really wanted to do was finish. more time with your mom and dad, but I was terrified. I just couldn't do it. I was shy. So a lot of times, I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk, and I wouldn't run out. They were sure they were. And they probably felt what's wrong with her, but I just couldn't do it. So you sort of talked to us instead. Yeah. I was comfortable around kids because I had to keep my family. I just hit my family. Every time the subject of her hard times came up, I hear a subtle hesitancy in Susan's voice. At first I thought it was embarrassment, but that was an indigestion. It wasn't until we had been talking for hours that I realized what it was. She was waiting for the other shooter drop. She hadn't forgotten that her past had happened. She just forgotten that I'd witnessed part of it. interfere became clear. The one that had been knowing it, our entire conversation, was that I was calling to say she damaged the new by exposing me to it. I don't think I was too kind back then because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family. And that's what my fear is that I might have had a negative impact on people. And I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age. But  you just want to remember. And for you, I was the babysitter. The kid loved me. Love, love, love, love. But I would be devastated if I hurt anything different. [\"Pomp and Circumstance\"] There are parts of your past. You don't want to go back to. Parts of your self. You don't want to go back to. And for Susan Jordan, the earpilated, I remember, is your she just is in forget. And it turns out, I'd also done my best to forget what I was that year. I didn't think of myself this way at all. But Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentlest terms possible. When I was nine, I was anxious and bookish. I was kind of up tight. Not the same as the men's fault that I just kept thinking that kids don't know how to play. When I went to your room, I didn't seem  you had a whole lot of toys. I hope I got this right, but it just seems  there were mostly books and more educational things. I remember you had planned it since then. room and chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any goals. You didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had babysat just in more serious than general. So mainly I think that's what I did was try to play. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I memories had deceived us about each other. Even if they had deceived us about ourselves. As Susan said at one point, each of us remembered what we needed to about the other. I needed to remember the part of Susan that she doesn't think about much, her top-ness and face of hardship . She said she must remember it aside of my family, but I just take her grant it. That it was common in our house, that there were books. There wasn't much fighting. It was the first time in my life. I had ever seen that people live differently in the way I live. And that's what I decided I wanted from myself. You can try to return to childhood by looking at photos, or visiting the old neighborhood, or listening to recordings. Or you can find someone who need back them. Someone who haven't seen the sense. They still carry with them themselves and picture of you, but it's unclad about the years and between. Remember you better than you remember yourself and you can do the same thing for them. Alex, one bird. That 4. Every day I forget something else. Let's end our program today with one of the ideas we began it with. Remember, Kayla, the seventh grader who is already aware of how she cannot remember her own path. Well, this very idea comes up in a novel by Nicholson Baker. It really great. in a usual novel called the Everlasting Story of Nori. The book is told from the point of you of a nine-year-old named Nori who at some point talks about how hard it is to remember things. Actress Michelle Trakneberg leads a brief test. That afternoon, Nori chides her reconstructed every tiny detail of the international Chinese school in her mind. She couldn't even remember all the kids in the class. She remembered one very nice girl named Staffu, who left later on, who had a birthday party at her school in the school. Nori had floundered into the deep end. and have gotten about a gallon and a half of water in her lungs, and thrown up a tiny bit on the grass. She gave Stephanie a pair of tiny glass slippers, wrapped up and probably the best wrapping paper she had ever drawn. She still thought about those glass slippers. They were paper-wates that a glass glow or may, but they worked as real dull shoes. They were amazingly wonderful. It disturbed Norway very much to think that all she was going to know about. what happens in my life was not very much at all. You can only really remember the things that happened when you were an older child, and the things that happened to now. That is yes, today or the day before yes, today or late last week. You live your life always in the present, and even in the present, this day, dozens and hundreds of little tiny things happen. So many that by the end of the day you can't make a list of them. You lose track of them unless something reminds you. Say someone says, remember when you dropped your... the morning, and you do remember, but then that is lost in the table. Now, some things you can just accept that you're not going to have the slightest chance of remembering. It would be nice, but  that it would be basically impossible. For instance, being in your mother's womb, as it's called. Some people thought babies could remember that. Nor I one morning asked Lilliguy if he could remember being tucked away in Mommy's belly, long ago, and he's... said, yes. He said, it had all things there, in she's tummy. It had things that were called steam trains. It was filled with steam trains, city of Truro, Lord of the Isles, the Mound, pictures with steam trains and toy ones and jumping things. Thilled filled with day. Well, of course there were and toy trains in Norris' mother's room, unless maybe he was remembering the small intestine, shopping around. Maybe he was remembering. the freight train of food being digested, going around and around. That probably not. Still, Norr thought it would be nice to be good thing back at least to the age of 3. It shouldn't be impossible. 3. Older than Little Guy and Little Guy could understand an amazing number of things. But Norr can go back that far, really except for a few scripts and scraps. You remember? being eight and back into being seven and she went pretty much back to five and then it teetered a little bit. She all remembered her fourth birthday party, a mermaid party because she had watched the tape a bit a number of time on TV. One thing though, she made a point of remembering and passing on to her older self, every year that she got a year older, she said to her parents. Remember when I was five? I said I was five going on six. Remember when I was six I said six going on seven? When I was seven I'd be going seven on eight. Then going on eight on nine? Well now I'm going nine on ten. So each year the list of years got a little longer. But you remember the earlier times that way by saying list over. Another thing she made sure to bring along every year with her for a long time was memory that there were many, many little amounts of money. She had found in the car and thought to be hers. but maybe not. Or time's her parents had bought her doll outfit or something when she told them she would reimburse them later, when they got home with her own money. Or gifts she bought other people with her own money, but borrowing it from her parents since she'd forgotten her purse. She would skip way, not thinking to it, then still remember it and bring it into the next day. Then skip a week, then bring it up. Finally, she couldn't keep the amount in her head because it had been added on. and subtracted from so much and it began to pull it hurt. And I thought, I know, I'll pay them $100 when I grow up. And that will surely make up for anything I'd rather than long to wait. Then she didn't have to keep track of that. Michelle Trackenberg, who plays Buffy's Little Sister and a portal and a key on the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, reading an excerpt from Nicholson Bakers, evalasting story. of Nore.
