  "text": "It was Junior Palm, David stated that Ditch done and wasn't doing so great. As he walked, he got some cigarettes to explain to me that the Palm is the culmination of a three-year campaign in his part, getting him to the cool ground, mostly white crown. He began with the arrive and he can park high school. See, this is the story between the five. It sounds a freshman, I would have to hurry, I would have to hurry, I would have to hurry, not really go away. So, I'll quit, I see others, I'm going to risk beautiful girls, I would not only dream but have it on my way. or just even  taking them on date, you're doing physical work, right? Third, you're just freezing, probably, in the park. Almost gorgeous girls call Asgard Pop, she says yes. So, Goddamn, I changed lives. So, I got into this crowd, I just changed my speech, my dress, and all this stuff. So, the same person, I changed, I'm just, oh, this is a popular crowd. I'm just popular, no. So, it's not in the pool, right? She's just a resistor, but I can hardly move. She's so gorgeous, take on, , just, I mean, I go with her this year. She's so gorgeous and all the other drugs is in damn. I can't go now if she, if he's giving up for her, if he's asking for me. I'm trying to think, who's my rapper that I think? And I'll tell you this, I want some fistful. I want to hear this flow around what they're meaning, kiss her, kiss her, feel her up or whatever. You're even more in a glob of weight or whatever. But I would count on that, I was here to have fun. And that'd be an ice teacher to it. That'd be a bonus, . That was a push. And she's out of here  a legend. Best friend get the to a site in your animal long. Which is my home in coat. The problem. We don't make it's going to the army in this country. And I'm making a college. We don't make them get married. But if they're still in school when they're 18, they're glad with the impentrable fact that is the prom. They've got to go with the junior prom. You get a choice. And then they have to take a stand. Yeah. So, not go. That's some kind of experience. Use it to try to climb to a new group of friends. Use it to try to get the girl. Just try to get through it. The stakes are weirdly high for a 19. Good luck. As you get older, I think a lot of people tend to roll the rise if they are being wrong. Because you're a slider, there's something about it that just feels embarrassing. See if you went. close and massage or music just the whole thing. I speak for myself. It's embarrassing to think how thrilled that was to go out. That night, the whole thing seemed brought in the possibilities. To me and to all of us. So today, we're in the midst of promises and right now, we bring you four stories from, let us understand it as adults. That one of our program today, tornado prom, what happens when a natural disaster strikes the same night as the unnatural disaster that that is from back to, see the last dance from me, again, Francine Pascal, and I'm gonna walk through a 700-foot 13-hiders including the Sweet Valley Highbooks. This one is Y, teen stories always have to end at the prom, not great. When we do things for certain in life, death and taxes, in this act, you can experience over the radio, a complete typical prom, and oh, just the time, I don't  you should have an hour to find date. Back for, only one thing missing. is the epicenter of prom genius is the place with the prom futures being born how to race in Wisconsin they have added one ingredient to the prom that takes to a whole new level of intensity one magic ingredient find out what it is stay with us the BB EZ Chicago it's this American life I'm a reverse that one you need a prom So in Huisington, Kansas, a few years back, on the eight of hit on prom night, poisoned into the small town of about 3,000, nobody at the prom was heard. Back, nobody at the prom even knew what happened. But during prom over a third of the town's destroyed, one-on-one man was dead. In the seniors' left to figure out what to think in the whole thing. There's an burden from his son. On Friday nights, the teenagers in Huisington, dragged mainstream. Where they go to a party at someone's house, and the boy shoot best hits in the driveway. and the girls jump on the trampoline. Sometimes the parties are out in the country at Paws. Ticks in the sixth they tell me. Since it's Kansas, there's weird weather. High winds that make the power clicker on and off. They get a lot of tornado warnings, but they never thought one would actually touch down here. Poisoned team just seemed too boring to be visited by a natural disaster. It's just  nothing happens. Always in some , everyone says I was , I was , all right, nothing will happen. Nothing happens. It's just  while it turned out coming in. Calm actually feels grand and poisoned. The day of the dance the girls drive down to great bend and get their hair done at main attractions, they all were long gowns. They shop for them at a store in Wichita that won't sell the dress you buy to anyone else in your town. The dresses are elaborate and  all prompineries, extremely difficult to explain. It's  black and it's fitted but when you look at it from other directions it's silver and royal blue purple or shiny there's  two straps that go back in the cross or on sort of spline  people would ask what it look and it was so hard to explain to them because it's just so unique. all very I tie Not really anyone didn't have  a tight dress or  long. They were just One sheet  I can still really don't know not just that there's just  white cloth I think from the female the Elm is her night  most ladies are From the be everything I think they wanted to be so unitell never forget. So I'm hoping to add this. I mean I wanted to hear lots of magazines, just looking at themes and stuff and we had a whole junior class vote on which one they wanted. And they came up to be Lost and Move. So it's kind of ironic. We really were lost and what was happening? We didn't know what was going on. I mean, after it. It's lost. What happens when a prom meets a tornado? When two events went off and then did disaster, collide. The data broke the prom and the tornado came the poison tin. Everyone tells me with common a sports shadowing. Started out of sunny, but looked stormy by dinner. It was sprinkling by the time everyone parked your truck south of the night of Columbus Hall on Main Street. They ducked in ran inside Tom. There's a crowd of people taking pictures. I mean, it's I was out of basketball games. I was , shh shh. How do miles out to a little bit? This is Sean. He's a junior. He videotaped the prom, partly so he could show his mom what she missed. From here, he and his classmates tell the story. It took a minute for people, , finally starting to eat themselves. We got their late. So  since we got  a ride at A-pop. So soon as we got there, the dance bar just started dancing. We danced for  an hour or so, , about an hour. And then light started flicking off. it didn't flicker. It kind of went off and then it came back on. People just, some people  my friend Ty and his kind of scared and his kind of scared... She's breaking out the send me to just find yourself. Normal blackout thing. There's a lot of people screaming in the morning and just the ammectin life. So I was to make a deal with that one time. Hand me that beard, break out the cake, stuff  that. Light's my back home. Everybody just kind of looked around. When, come to what? When I'm your worried age... When you're awake, When you're have to beHA The more it grows, the more when someone else likes it. When you needs to be on the hydrangea effects. When somebody's even  trying to do a bunch of stuff. And put the band from my durante. what even anything do The door kept open and we knew we could hear it was really we knew it was getting When it'd be outside and someone had said that it started to rain and People were go out and look and it was  rain was just coming in horizontally It was just blown down the street We didn't think anything of it It was just, oh, , we had to go out in this later. Didn't think it was as bad as what it was. They were playing I'm a survivor from this and this child. And that was  next to last song for the lights black out. Who would know, , I mean, you would have thought that that song would be playing one of the last times that a tornado right before it ripped through right here. second time, everybody just kind of stood around, everything waiting, then , we're  hurry up, turn the lights back on, come on in the sun, stand around that crime, . DJs came out and they had a long stick and they were trying to get everyone to do a limbo, just to keep us entertained and why the lights were up because they could have been in music or anything  that so they had a line. and then the limbo going through. And that was when our principal told us that we needed to go downstairs. It's surely after the lights were out, the door of nice flambis, then this is basically sucked open. This is  the principal of poison to nice skull. That point I walked over and you could feel the pain glass kind of vibrating a little bit. And it's subsided a little bit. I stepped outside and as I stepped outside and ambulance was coming down the main street and saying uhhh... the P.A. saying, get an basement. Okay, it's in news. Here's a break. We've got them. There's a lock in the sink. We can't get out to get more fear and drugs. I've always been outside. The wind is blowing and the rain is coming down hard. Everybody come to the wait and take shelter. It's not a joke. You win those. Get your math out. That's just over your head. So get yourself as a serious host. I'm out. Get out. Get out. Get out. I was just taping it, she just came up to start saying that stuff. But I talked to Rattler, she didn't, she had no idea, , there's no idea, she feels bad for even saying that stuff. So, it was , well, she's around learning. I was , who is the best girl ever ever ever, who makes me look  you. I was , how can I see you? I'm a liar, you are. I mean, when I wasn't looking in the camera, it was , pitch black. with  two flashlights in the distance. She can  barely say. I'm not really scared. I'm not really scared. It was dark and we haven't probably seen everybody. Mr. Norton said that we weren't allowed to go our principal. So we weren't allowed to go upstairs until the cops came and told the set of it. So I said, hey, I asked him, I was , well, are we down here because the hail storm, instead of storm tornadoes going on, he's , well, right now everything would be. speculation. I just didn't stop on the stairs and I'm sorry. I made the call that problem and be canceled. Two hours later I looked back in the state and so I didn't thought, well that was a silly statement. That's sure that didn't even have to make that statement. They weren't even being a kid there. That wanted to stay at prom. It just goes to show how little we knew. When we were, we were blocks away from the street. So that's when my people that would have cell phones I started getting on those. And a lot of rumors were flying through. When people... I mean, it was , okay, all of a sudden someone pops up and says, Zach, your house is gone. Or , Jacob, your sister's house is gone. And then it was , all of fifth street's gone. All of six streets gone. I was just , don't jump to conclusions because you don't know what's true and what's a lie and what's a rumor. These are rumors flying everywhere. That Derek knew it was gone and everybody that was in it was dead. And I mean, that was where we're gonna have breakfast after active muscle. There's people crying because no one can't leave. We don't know where our families are at. We didn't know how to get a hold of anybody. It was, I don't even know if I can explain the feeling. Just , I was, I was just, it was just so scared. I was, it was almost, you couldn't really even talk. All I could do was cry. I just, that's all I could do. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. Well, we're setting everybody to start walking upstairs, , and we're still a little dark, . Yeah, it's looking for my focus, I'm taking it off and setting it on the chair. And me and the other guy looped up, both had the same looking, , boot near. So we're looking. He was  that looks  mine in his girlfriend was yeah, that's yours I can tell by that one I was  he shows I don't know how to catch you got here, but you didn't have it So I kept it I was looking for it couldn't find it. I couldn't find it and then I heard Somebody on my name I thought that's my brother. No, what would he be doing? I'm very Then he's  well, yeah, I go talk to mom. So I figured out she's a overreactant. She wants to talk to me He's her look okay Kind of seeering  there's a little bit of  I'm in doorway and make some of his figure and kind of talk some walked up to her. She started crying and my sister was sitting and crying. I just kind of was  on. Last time I heard her shouting that worried and scary was when my dad died. last time heard my mom sound  that. I kind of sat there and I didn't believe it at first because it's tornado. what tornado there's no tornado. We didn't know about you. You told me, I didn't think it was because I didn't see it. , I was right here. , how could there be a tornado without us now? We'll end this mom one outside. Everyone from prom was standing on the sidewalk. Main street looked fine. None of the buildings seemed to have been touched. The air felt nice and cool. At first, we'll feel that the cars were parked  from hail. But then we realized the storm had just covered them with little white flowers. No one  actually came up. and said, oh it was a tornado, it was. There was someone saying , hey, I'm coming here, you came here, you came here. There's where it gives you a kind of listen for your name. If there's a comment up it was , there's just  that one row of straight  six and seven. I mean that's what  all the kids are renamed off that little on that straight. There's , wait a minute, no, let it hit up there. Oh there was so many fire charts and ambulances. I mean they were just going to that. Lord just kept on going off the internet and nothing. They kind of  lit up the whole town when they went there and then you look on the other side and tell them to the guards. It was weird. Because it was  catchback basically. there is kind of  a job north even if all  it's so black, all of them. We drove her out for a while and that didn't be my song. houses that I used to know, ,  the one house head  big chunk for that at the top of it, ,  a tea rack. walk up and you took a bite out of the top of the rope and stuff. It was pretty amazing. My cousin had a separate car from my aunt so he took me as close as he could get me to my house and I just got out and I ran to my house. I was jumping over a power line to the treelands and everything in my prom. She was in flip-flops and I got there. This is a lane up. She lived on sixth street where the tornado hit. My mom said she cooked that supper that night. She had a crystal pitch. iced tea and a cinnamon table. It was still fine. After the tornado is still sitting  right there on the exact spot on the table and the touch on the roof was completely off the kitchen. Do we could stand in our kitchen and look up and you be looking up at the sky? That night, kids walked all over, hoisin' to the flashlights. All the places they could think to go, the dairy queen, the bowling alley, the grocery store, football field, we're gone. It wasn't just what something had finally happened in Washington. Poisoned tinhead. become an entirely different town. More rain I now scrumptious is around zero. I arrived in Hoisin's in about two weeks after the tornado and Elena took manna toward. Everything is normal on the side. There's the can't even tell anything ever happened. All sections of the town were still perfect. There were people on forges and shiny party balloons tied to mailboxes. Then we crossed over. A lot of the west side had already been bulldozed. Now it was just dirt and basements and house parts. Someone's front steps are a kitchen, cut away  a room in a doll house. And of course this is Kansas. The Main Street in town is a red brick road. Lots of people had spray painted their cars and houses and boarded up windows with references to the wizard of Oz. Everybody  right step back dorking. photo on their house is  our house. We had all the windows boarded shut and we had all kinds of things. We had  we're coming for you, Toto and  dear Dorothy, I miss you. If somebody finds me please pack me and send me to Oklahoma, love, Toto. To the kids in Washington, it started to seem  the tornado made choices. Why would it not down a house? But not even break the glass on a frames photograph on bright nights in purple. all kinds of weird stuff has happened. When they were in the Adam's room, they only think they found left in the room, wasn't movie twister. I don't know. And some people found a prom glass in their cupboard, and is from 1963, and they didn't have any kids. They were an old couple. They didn't have any kids that graduated that year, and they have no idea where it came from, but they found in their cupboard. Some teenagers started to look for a logic, and they were set in the room. was spared. I'm told that the junior class got at the worst, and that it's a known fact they've been jinxed and support grade. Addie, who lost her house, and Brooke didn't, told me that Addie's bad luck, and Brooke is good luck, that they joke about this all the time, that even at the moment the tornado destroyed Hoisin-Tin, Brooke was winning a prize at Paul. We'll take the whole thing a lot harder. Seems ,  what, we just can't get a break that we just can't get lucky. We'll start dice up. years ago had a heart attack on his birthday. And then last fall, the house will have lived in since he was little, got too expensive for his mother, and the family had to move out. The house was on the east side, and the tornado didn't touch it. Even still, when I drive by there, I look at the house and wonder what it would have been if the tornado hit and still lived at that house. , and I wonder if , if I still lived there with the tornado, it's come that way and hit us there, , because , is it because if... somebody in that stuff. And if I did live in that other house, , that maybe I would have, , that tornado probably would have came out over on these, , that it probably still would have came through and done something to the house, just the way I've been. I think it was meant to teach me a lesson, , in a couple of ways,  on my other stuff. Oh, we'll be close, we are the tornadoes. down. , that have something exciting going on in that now. It's , well, here, have a tornado. No, how do you feel about it? The Lena felt  she caused the storm, too. Friday night before the tornado, me and Addy were driving a clap and to hang out from friends and I was , you know, I didn't , I've never seen a tornado. I was , I really want to see once the touch. They're really scary. I've seen a couple, , but I've never actually  the name one. I was , I know. I was , man, the crazy enough but it really did happen. You're  24 hours almost exactly later. the next night, it turned out it kind of takes out our house. It was pretty freaky. I was , oh my gosh, I remember after the tornado where I got home on his crying, I was taking my mom and I was , I swear I made this happen and my mom's , no, I need to make it home. I mean, it's pretty scary. Saying, I never seen my real one sitting at the night before. It takes out my house. I asked Sean if he thinks the storm single people out. I don't think so really because that was sure it came straight to my house and would found me out home but it meant it. I had , , all the time. I mean  two sisters, the first one was a lot of as much said, oh I'm going to entrance. Bye! sister asked me if I'm gonna go with you. So I was , I got rejected by sisters. So it should have found me and  stuck me up by myself. Just to be , ha ha ha. And then hit my car and hit my room. So just hit my home house, just my room and my car. I scratched that bad luck I did with some. It was just a choice to figure that that happened. That was definitely the problem of all problems. I mean, it was a horrible, horrible experience to go through, but it was definitely problems. I mean, it's  something that every resident remember, , some people they look on prom, look back on prom and it's just a problem. Everybody knows what prom is. happen, , they know what's going to happen with prom, they know what prom is, , but now we can say what happened on prom night and it's really big of it now, ? I guess I'm just one that you'll never forget, really. I mean, thank you prom night night, I think it's born out of you though. I mean, everybody's going to remember it for that. Usually the story of prom's one of disappointment. You're in the bathroom crying during the slow dance, but you throw up at the hotel room party, but you go home feeling silly for having been excited about something so meaningless. The teenager. and Hoisinton got the kind of prom story everybody wants. They got a legendary prom, but night that actually did to use their lives. I mean it's I went to prom my sophomore junior years and it was a dance. It was a prom. It was nice. It was fun to get all dressed up, but it was  the prom that taught a lesson. , it just became our cars and clothes and more so important and family and friends me. It taught it a big lesson about humanity, I think, to everybody there. Everybody can have a new perspective, life walking out of that path. It was a way of  a whole different world. Just having fun with an actually outside and  totally opposite. People are in the basement, stuff falling down, houses are gone. People are actually losing stuff, where the problems still dance. When the tornado hits an afternoon, it's still just free of everything. There's  still happening. to get time. Some totally different way you want us to. You step out and say, you go into another world. Reality hints. Prompt isn't usually shattering you to the world so quickly. Suddenly, a lot of kids in the poisoned tin have to act  grown-ups. We'll go into college in the fall. That is sometimes things it would be better. better to get a job on an oil rig, give the paychecks to his mother. A senior named Zach actually pulled his parents out of the rubble of their own home, on prom night. But everyone's looking forward to rebuilding, and they're all getting used to the idea that anything can happen, even in Hoisin' Tinn. 2015 Sense on Staat System Brittney잡 Since we've respired cassettes during back in 2001, we'll, the nature of talking about how doomed he's up, and his family couldn't get a break, his father died in his house and his throat. He died in July, for a car accident. Just a few months after he was week, Sandenthrew. Even at the scene you're proud One storming that miss little town Everything got turned upside down letting me set the scene. I was dancing with the problem Just when she was kissed her She got carried out by a big old quick Don't let her walk the dance flow Don't let her walk the dance flow Coming up they've been doing your high school since the year tonight 1882. So when they say and this is direct quote, we have been dreaming about prom night for years. They lean it. That's in a minute, which is called a bubble Gradio, and then off program continues. This is American Life, my class. We took an appointment with course, we choose some theme, bring your variety of different kinds of stories and these program, very end of promises and stories about, , we've arrived in Act 2 of our program Act 2. See you soon. stands for me again. So pretty in pink and carry to that computer and cars between the class and the two many other movies and TV shows to name. They are, and actually you can't up at the prom. Why? Why the prom? Why is it so on the present? Well for answers we turn to Francine Pascal, who has written or invented the plot lines for 700 books in the sweet velvet high series, which of course is the adventures and visible Hopefully did. field, twins, and well, it's a permanent high school juniors. She's back to us from my home in France. Well, I have to say that the problem is probably the quintessential glory of high school. It's the moment that comes closest to the romantic vision of life. I think it's repeated again only one other time and that would be marriage. I mean, it's that important. in the high school life, in the teenager life, in that pre-life before adult. That's interesting. So as an attributional drama, where you'd want the characters to end up in marriage, and if you're ready to be teenagers, all you've got is the problem. We hit that's about it, that's right. And out of the 700 bucks, oh, I probably, from, is mentioned in at least 500 of them. But I would say, it's probably a major goal. almost 33. 35. 35 or so books actually take place at the proms and actual proms. Yeah, there is a prom as the plot scroll or a very important part of the plot. I can give you just ideas of it. There's, I think in the second book, I did a plot about who is going to be the king and queen of the prom. And there was, , rigging the election. And it turned out just to give you an idea. Spot on getting a date to the prom. Well, buddy, who has no date to the prom, the wrong date to the prom, the wrong date to turns out right for the prom. And I know there was a part about this school girl. Her brother had to take her. I mean, that's permanent trauma. And then there's the other thing with his money for the prom dress. And there's the one about you. Thank you for going to ask you, buddy. someone else and every army when you're putting your involved is as many plots as I am. , they begin to fall into some categories and there's things  the back plot. The blood pot? The back wager,  a wager, the back plot or the pledge plot where you just the boy asked the girl on a back to go to the prom or the pledge is he has to ask. the leaf popular girl in the class to go to the prom and then she finds out and then he really wants to go with her but it's too late because she's furious and that takes her whole book to settle down. It seems  one of the common prom parts is in prom courses and choice, and so things. And often it'll be the good looking, unattainable boy or girl is one possibility and the smart funny best friend is the other possibility. Exactly. Exactly. of use that sort of thing is also perfect because so these people are not going to be living for the rest of their lives and not legally married or anything but they do have to make that first important choice of the person they are going to spend that momentous evening with. And it's a, it's a, it's almost a mini marriage kind of choice. In book number 142 in the sweet ballet series, a straight-cut big night. have not won, not to not read, but four characters who end up switching their dates at the prom and one girl tries to kill her date. Oh, that must have been a thriller. A court-courtney tries to push on off of a boat railing into the water and Elizabeth is in a speedboat. Soaring, yeah. Right. Yes, well, . That's just a variation on a theme. That's all. You have to do something  you different with them. When you are 140. Listening to you talk about this. It seems  what the prom does and what it gives you as a writer. As it gives you a natural arena where there could be a conflict over love and an affirm and without the prom you have to invent some situation which would feel  it has weight. Whisk. just has a way. Exactly. Because the problem is it's a natural. It comes filled with all kinds of emotion. Just the mention of the past. You don't have to create something and build it up and give it terrible importance. You don't have to do any of those things. Did you get a problem yourself? I never went to my own pop. I was not interested. Drink. things we in our eyes. I didn't  high school very much at all. It's funny that I ended up writing so much about it. And what did you think of the problem? I really was not interested. I felt that I was just sophisticated and mature for that sort of stuff. And I just didn't... I never, I never really participated beyond writing speeches for the political pandemic will be one. on the newspaper. That's what I liked. But beyond that, I just didn't have an interest. You never cared to go to the prominence. So you've now somehow faded, but you in a situation where you've had to revisit it over 35 times. So it's true. Yes, it's my punishment. But it's different because I don't have to show up there. The charming, fancy, pesky outsider of Sweden. On the phone, get in the mood! I'm a little more aware of my words, all  rain through the phone. I was always hoping that I could be here page, but when I call you, I'll never hold you. That dream, death, and pucks is, so let's go to the problem, huh? You and me back in 1994, when I was a reporter friend, here's all of my students. They were actually covered with senior problem, and half high school in Chicago. And we thought we were quite destroying that right here. Back in 1990, I woke up on stage. That night after I transported to Maryland, you went to the airlines, what do you mean by indistinct stuff? and contrast to the prompts in Francine Pascal's books, this captures on tape with prom usually. Here is this very old recording. All year long, the teacher sees students who's slouch and gossip, students who work clothing that teachers don't understand. Students who need prodding and discipline, and constant surveillance. And then, on prom night, the students reappear, transformed as an dream. And the teachers wander around or marking to each other, can you believe how well-behaved they are? Have grown up, please. Matthew Jerry had his help planned him off the years. I think they really made it great. They really made it. They really made it. They really made it. They really made it. They really made it. These are fussies or the seniors that have made it. All the f**k are out. Pearl River didn't air us day. George Bore hadn't bothered with the talks. He were a black shirt. He was getting a black tie. Black pants. No jacket. They were having fun. Except for one small hitch. Holy 6 seas horse shirt. I don't dance because he can't. Well, it's not that I'm wrong. It's  a kid. He's a kid, yeah. Maybe if they play some metal, he said, slam dance. 94. Woo! 95. It's a good boy. This couple was having a different kind of pop. We're going to Niagara Falls tomorrow morning. But tonight we're just going to party. My girlfriend hasn't telling me where we're going to go to the halls. I'm going to a special place. And I got him a special hotel room somewhere. And it's a surprise. What do you think I'm saying about this? Mom, mom gave me that  mother daughter sex talk But it's a little silly for that Kind of in one year out the other but she was so very worried and she and mom made it do this God it was ways to money, but You're mother gave you a mother daughter sex talk. Yes. Yeah, saying it Something maybe he might because I'm leaving her college okay And since we've been together this long, it's gonna be very dramatic between us to leave each other So she's  all he's In the bus, the moon's on him's gonna try to do sex ants! He tried to keep you here, but... It's too late for that. On the dance floor, there was a certain amount of copying fields and kissing. But the sexual tension at the palm hit a kind of surreal xenon. When the DJ told the boys to bring chairs down to the dance floor, girls were seated in the chairs, and the guarders ceremonially began. We both killed their frontier. Over a hundred teenage girls presented bare legs with guarders. Hold in. I have to teach you this. You need to make it. Meaning, grab the guarder with your teeth. All right. I want to kill back the shooting. I'm here. See. No. This is the kind of activity that separates the just friends Palm Dates from the real Dates. And dozens of just friends stood around the edges of the hall in various states of discomfort. Two. Two. One. One. One. One. in teenage boys, bring their faces up against a slightly sweaty thighs of their dates. Rip multicolored garders with their teeth and drag them off the leg. It's a shocking and amazing sight, but when I asked teachers about it later, they all say, where have you been? They've done this for years. I'm coming apparently, things get even more explicit. Alright, okay, let's move to the kids and we'll have a slow dance. Alright, okay, let's move to kids and we'll have a slow dance. As evening war on, George and Carla, a couple of the didn't dance, did go out for a couple of slow numbers. Later, when it was time to leave, they picked up their prom favors, took some balloons from the centerpieces. And joined another couple of Mark and Charlotte, Mark's father's food tempo, and they searched for her radio station. What did that CKC? She's not so normal when you hit me right. No, I'm not. She's not too hit me right. I  it. 9 Alright No man Hospital Hey And Man Everybody pitched in dollar for gas parallel waived people in other cars and inhaled the helium from a prom balloons Hi They argued about directions discussed who one owner rider is going out these days And finally After nearly an hour, we ended up with a party. Pretty lively party, but mostly we stood around outside. Where's my liquor? It was hard! Now where's my liquor? Charlotte repeated this about, oh, 20 times. Nobody else seemed to interested in getting drawn. But finally someone organized a liquor run. I think it is sell to you. To sell to me, if they don't sell to me, they'll sell to somebody else. What do you want? Can we lie mad, don't baby? Mad Dog, what kind? Can we keep you? Wait, he needs some food. You're gonna have five big. Throughout the year of the time. One thing you forget when you're not a teenager is how much time teenagers spend just standing around, waiting, waiting to get organized, waiting for everyone to show up, waiting for the person buying liquor to return. Percentage wise, this was the largest part of the evening. In variable, during this time, someone starts to get on someone else's nerves, for Charlotte and George is so miserable. Look at this, look at this. Show is the abs, man. She never shuts up. Now I should just keep that. talking and talking. It's , when did she shut up? And it's  the tonal voice she uses too. She's  a whiny. Yeah, totally voice. So I can only hear it. I had a put up for when she first started going to TIF. Man, and I hated it, and I hated it now. So I'm just bringing me down, . Go ahead. Go to my boss. I ran 130. A decision was made to go to the beach. When a Chicago's downtown,  Michigan Beach. In the church, you can't have it. And after much debate and four attempts to get it doesn't people into cars, we finally drove to Belmont Harp and walked out to the big rocks on the water. Everyone stared at the lake. The city lights made the clouds glow orange in distance you can see some fog and the lights of the water pumping rays. Those compensations man, how do you  to work out there? You keep the work out there after three days, three days shifts. Right. You hold the outer, you switch and feed you. You work and you get paid and you just hang around there. And it's  roll, call city, yeah, I have to get paid through the ass bar. I mean, so scary to be an employee, , , and so dark. So that's a really special thing. I really feel uneasy, you're out of the water. So did you say you feel uneasy but weren't? Water, open water. But , I want to see you. Oh man, space, it's freeing me out of the same. It's the best way in space you can go. My then, why isn't she to it fairly? The dire speech that's coming from him is surprising. He's college bound and did student on football team. He's really easy going. It's a compliment. Seriously man, there's no fucking freedom. He's got their place man. There's always some cop where somebody asks me what you're doing or what you're doing. But there's always somebody who owns a place. There's always going to come to you and ask you, , especially when you're on your age. Then they got to really get on your back. You lecturers about it, which you got supposed to know, which you're supposed to do. Where in Charlotte you're up to cigarettes? Charlotte takes you to choose on. We talk about this in that. And then we look behind us and see the blue lights through the trees. What's that? It's a couple of years ago. No evening  this can be complete without a running police. They're perhaps a hundred yards away in the parking lot in their squad car. Or if you get now, they're ready to get now. The police hover there a few minutes, put a ticket on one kid's car and drive off. No big deal. Next up naturally is an all-night restaurant. By the time we owe the plastic denies and then use in our hands, it's for an... morning. You ready to order? I want salad. They got so pissed what he pleasantly stopped at the top of it. Fayed had handed them a prom and they knew they were supposed to stay out all night and they kept wandering in place to place, waiting for something to happen. Nothing much did but nothing bad did either. I'm starting to get laid outside. I can't sleep all day. Back in The Card between the Card members and the Card Explorer.. said that the best moment of the problem was when he got to slow dance with Carla. Mark said it was when he missed getting ticket from those cops. Charlotte said it was when she looked around at other people at the prom and realized that she no longer had to return to the house. you that for you when you're missing. So every year for the past 60 years, in the 30 weekend in May, all the high schools and race sceneless concept for the proms. On the same night, I've got all the proms landed to get some all seven schools drive a parade route, two town, convertibles and limos and hunting cars, ice cream trucks and semis post prom party, which in received a bigger than the actual prom cell. First, by the local Rotary Club, it goes from 8.30 at night till 3.00 next morning. People set up volunteers to watch the procession of cars. It is a huge, huge deal. And then, 27 years ago, it got even bigger when he door tells him that. The good people have recently seen loved their problem, and they were always looking for ways to make it better. And so, they added to it. A force, even more powerful than the problem itself. they added live television coverage. Last year, 16,000 eyes were watching. A right of package, seven schools, one great location, one night angle. From its prom, prom, live Saturday, May 19, 930 p.m. What will you be wearing? It's a really, really... incredible atmosphere with an 8,000-hour laser show, 5 to 10,000 dollars for the balloons and flowers. Craig Haskin has been running the rotary clubs post-prime for the past couple of years. He was voted into the job by his fellow Rotarians, simply because he is 27 years old and by far the youngest Rotarian in Racine. And he looks young. On prom night, he has to wear a special badge, so the high school kids know not to ask him to dance. There are school uniform people. They're right carpet television crews to talented the the host and host is that interview when you walk through the door and I'm just  Joan Crawford John Rivers Joan Rivers just  Joan Rivers when you walk through where are you wearing Good evening everyone and welcome to time-worn our table coverage of 2001 rotary post from parade live from festival hall on your team's lake But my name is Jack Bowdozer. When I was walking down the red carpet, I felt  I was, you feel  a celebrity. Jack Fishbain was a senior at Hornlet High this year. And there's fans, people, all ages, , there's glitches, half glitches, hundreds of people around the rival area. People screaming in their name, taking pictures, holding their hands out. I feel  the power, but I have to rest, , follow me around. Tell the vision. cameras in your face. What did you do before you got there? I was really trying to come to the company. The whole school there. Okay. So you all ate together and then came down here. There's people on the left of the carpet interviewing and watching all these limousines and friends coming in. Everyone feels  a celebrity and everyone sees everyone else's as celebrity. Everybody. is everybody's best friend at post-prime. You walk in and you see the strobe lights flashing and the celebrity feeling is even multiplied when you get there and that feeling doesn't go away until I still have three weeks later and I'm still feeling the celebrity watching it all again on television so as long as you keep watching and everyone knows how big of it is it really isn't downplay. , once you kind of lose that feeling, you think about problems, start talking about it with again, and people want to hear about it. People who didn't go and have been watching and have so many questions for you, did you do this? Did you see this person, what kind of music did they play? You are the center of attention when prom is tough. So you all, you maintain that celebrities' scene. Here's what it looks  to the home viewer. Because this is love budget, local. People programming. It's mostly just one camera shot. Couples enter the festival hall passing two by two in front of the camera. We're moving in high morning straight into the camera. One after the next. And this goes on for four hours. In Zach's house, this footage has become a kind of video wall paper. While I was there interviewing, I copied as a cable broadcast played the whole time living. Sometimes a family member would drop. about the conversation, to stare at it for a while. Now, and then, X-Lone's says of what color attention to the screen. Here he comes. Look how handsome we have been so excited with that we watched it numerous times. It's great. I mean, we play at the back all the time. It's right. We have two copies of it. It's in two TVs. And every time you watch it, you see somebody different. So much fun, we run into the parents and the kids in the city, , to say, and you're being trusted, you're matching taxes just great and it's great. If you ask the local television studios, what's the biggest? Again, Craig Haskins. The Oscars Super Bowl or Prom, you at Hands Down say, because it's the highest rated anything. In town, that's a good way to judge people's interests and what they're watching on TV. Proms everywhere are all of that hype. So it's no surprise that once you have a problem, that's a TV show, that the ratings would be hyped to. The cable company's commercial says that 60,000 eyes were watching a prom. By that, they actually mean 30,000 viewers, two eyes per viewer. And really, even that number is just a guess. For sure. One person who's not watching the problem, is Kirsten Hipski. I spoke with her other job at Desmond's formal wear, a taxi to rental store at the Regent's E-Moll. It is also safe to say that Kirsten was the only person in the mall that night, who was reading Play Does, Pages. I'm reading it, I'm soliciting your own school and you're a wonderful and I want reading it. I also can purchase my drink. You didn't go to prom. No, no, I didn't. The ring fell at the attendee. Yes, it went. is a beautiful illusion. People here indulge in the thought that maybe they're not in place that they are. Your scene is not a glamorous place. I mean, I know I'm part of it. If you're someone who hates the poem. There's no better way to reveal your hatred in my work and a touch shop. Here's what it says, everyone at the store despises the perm. The worst part being when the kids bring their sweaty suits back. Sometimes I'll come up  stuffed into a little grocery bag, tied and tied and tied and we had to bring it to some back-to-hole thing and pick it up very lightly. The gloss here got  fungus underneath her fingernails, and I'm feeling this on the socks. She gets suitably. Rastains. Oh yeah, grass, few mud. For people that say that prom is there for people to feel special. I don't know about that. I mean, find me one high school senior who really needs a ego boost. It's the time to be cocky and prideful. And I think it's kind of indulgent of shit. If they say that they feel  a celebrity, it doesn't surprise me at all. Because they do get treated  celebrities, even though they know the personality might be less than you. I'm certain about it. I can talk part in it. To truly enjoy the racing prom, maybe to enjoy any prom. You have to be the sort of person who enjoys the hype and will love to it. Zach certainly did for basically his whole life. I have been watching Prima Television every every every May and it's only natural middle schoolers, elementary school grade school high school all ages are watching this. So every year we watch it and as a kid I thought I was going to come to the helicopter with a yellow succino. Actually this year there was a kid. the yellow text, I see it all, but no hell of a cop there's unfortunately. Watching it on TV, I just, I never realized how glorious this festivity really was until I actually was a part of it. I mean it seems great you look so forwards with and it was even better when I got there because it was the real thing out of experience. And it was the realization and the fact that I knew I was actually there and no longer looking forward to it made it that much better. Prom after all is just a dance plus a whole lot of hype. Racing under Sandstress so well that it's possible they've created the greatest problem in the world. They've hyped it to the point that when I asked a bunch of junior high school girls and they were looking forward to the prom. All of them looked at me is if I just asked them if they were in fact of. the human species. Because it's fine. By the time they reach seeing him here, knows how to get me dead.
