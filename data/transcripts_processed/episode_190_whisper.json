When he talks about his life this far, he says he just didn't have a choice, that's what he means. When I was, basically when I was locked up in June, I was there for a year and I really believed that if you locked up a year, just with a whole bunch of guys, it really makes me chummy to stage. I was at all all that I  to do and most likely I just did  this guy and I told you everything  guy they passed the ball but we can say these real males can really know that it's just a act it's  really you girl but she acting  a dude It can be very, very, very frustrating and confusing when you are  around a whole bunch of metals. Because what starts to happen when you're around other metals is  the deep side that you, the female parts, try and come out and try to just try to say something, but deep side you push in that person down. It's  the egg of crack in the pre-knowers become a bird. I know it's some very free to, but this is totally real. If you try and figure out who you are, it's funny what can inspire you. What can be helpful on giving strength? Tito for example is an M&M fan. The night M&M performed at the Grammys, trying protesters, egg protesters, got a home of fun bit and said. Tito was at a party with gay kids and bisexual kids and trans sexual kids. He's who are actually born as boys but live as girls. Throughout watching the Grammys on TV and cheering for him. Tito explains it this way. Here's his white guy, M&M. He's somehow felt that part of black culture was just inside him. And decided that he would rap  a black guy. And ended up able to pass in that world. Transgender people is the same way. It's a boy that feels... a woman inside and want to be greeted that go ahead and explore that. So they want to press  a girl and act  a girl. It's in the same category for somebody that feels black inside. I feel so heart-caged but I feel black inside. And I want to explore it, right? And I think if M&M can do it, in druk I mean transcended and in successor Next year There's a deep part of American culture. You saw about the idea that you can make yourself into anyone. Have any of our movies or about the idea that I'm going to be a star. I'm going to sing dance, take Wall Street by Stone. Own this crazy town. See my name in light. Someday be a gangster. Someday be a real boy. Someday get to Washington and make a difference. Someday weave my uncle's farm on tattooing. Become a Jedi Knight  my father. What today on our program? Stories of people who felt this very American call to be something they were not. happen. Who WB Easy Chicago in Public Radio International, it's a American life, America Glass. I program today in 3X, back one, girls, girls, girls, story of teenagers who were born as boys, but lived as girls in Los Angeles, at 2, age into the stars. A fan's unlikely dream to meet his favorite movie star accidentally works, probably who is the right part to do his horror, agree, Arya Sharon, she Monteras, David Ben Goyon, and me, an American teenager who dreams someday of becoming the prime minister of a nation where he does not even reside. Stay with us. Back when, girls, girls, girls. Over the last 10 years in Los Angeles, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of trans sexual teenagers. These are both boys and girls. You see the monestries? Both are on the rise, but the boys do win. as girls are a little more visible. As you might expect, they prefer to be called Chi, 19, and girls, not boys. Prism spent the last two years getting to know these kids, interviewing and writing about them. Did you tell us this story? I'm writing a book about trans sexual youth. In Los Angeles where I live, there are hundreds of them, noisely laughing on street corners, run away as cast-offs from families who can't possibly understand. There have always been trans sexualism. and everywhere else, but never so many kids so visible and so determined. They come here because they hear they can find underground formats or friends or simply because it's the biggest city they can think of. And because they fall into the radar of regular social services on the street, they're playing doctor, nutrition, health adviser and shrink to one of them. I've hosted pliers around asking them to share their stories. I got one call from a 20-year-old minute last year. her name was Fox Tuzel and she told me she was going to be the first international fan sexual pop star. She described herself so I could recognize her. I'm very beautiful she said. I'm tall and black with butter pecan, caramel skin and long luxurious silk hair. She suggested we meet at the Red Lobster. When I got there I saw she wasn't lying. She was very pretty. She wore glitter on her eyes and had silver times right at the end of her hair. On a ripped jeans she had sprawled the birds. Latins do it better. She'd grown up, light, air, Jackson, in Birmingham, Alabama. As early as she can remember, she felt  a girl. When the teacher would parcel kids off into boy and girl teams and kindergarten, fox stood their frozen, not knowing which group would join. And when she hit out of lessons, fox had to invent herself  any other teenager, but without the templates, prompting, brainy, chalk. Fox had to make up a full persona that fit with the gender. inside her. It's a trait that attracts me to these transgender kids in general. They're intense drive to develop their own melody and then their own rules to go there. For instance, for a few years in high school inspired by Prince, Fox with Paster own name, Marka Simple. I did not use my name at all. I would just use a paint triangle. I would always kid paint sparkle with me every day and if I wanted to sign my name, I would do it in my heart, just  I would paint triangle. Because the paint triangles are visually from the hollow class. because back then a lot of the gay people there in the concentration camps got Pete Triangles put on them but then the creative soldier I am I put some little bit different on there I put a sign of a woman on there and don't  it's  the same time that you see  when you go into the women's bathroom it has that little symbol of law. the woman in a skirt? Yes exactly it looked exactly  that and that's  the symbol I acts you And I've got a necklace  that and people would ask me what does that mean? What does that mean? Everyone would ask me that. And I would love with people to ask me that because I would love to just tell them I would say this. I would say it means that I'm a woman trapped inside of a mill's body. That's what it means. Fox Cross Rest and Secret and alone in her room pretended to be Janet Jackson. Sometimes she'd sneak out. her window laid at night and cheap Halloween wigs and halter talks and just walk around her neighborhood. She wouldn't run into anybody, she just liked how it felt. Unlike the parents of many of these kids, who will throw them out at first-to-scab room was the let-o in school bad. Fox's parents were supportive of their own child. They just worried for her safety. But she worried for her sanity. She knew she had to go someplace where the unusual was more usual. So as soon as she graduated, she got a job, so it helped her pass. and bought a bus ticket to Los Angeles. And this is where the story begins. Kowangan Hollywood Boulevard is wrapped for a set off, this is where I hit Sitz myself. My name was when you paved down there, all one of these stars, one of these days. The corner of Kowangan Hollywood is part of the famous Hollywood Rock of Stars. Every square of sidewalk is embedded with polish star. Matt Bellamy, I don't know if that is. Harry, one dollar. Alfred, great. This people were so famous. Why haven't I ever heard of them? Fox was just 18 when she got to LA, but she arranged to stay in a group home called Covenant House, where a lot of stray gay kids go. In some ways, it's easier for trans kids to hook up with other girls  themselves than it's ever bad. Fox found where to stay in LA from the gay yellow pictures, before she ever left from them. Sam? trans kids use the internet to pick it up. With the jump to full tilt woman who came on a casual Friday, the telemarketing for Fox who worked on the time. On Fridays employees were told they could wear whatever was comfortable. Most people showed up in jeans and low-purs. Fox showed up as a woman. The values came down. And it was just , Fox is ill. I mean, all those years trapped inside of that boy's body. I mean, 19 years' beaks. that it would it just can she just can take me. She just can take just dressing up on nights just dressing up on weekend. She wanted to be out all the time. Since that day last January, Fox never dressed as a man again. She's fully fox, even when she goes home to Alabama on her Christmas. Then what happened if you decided to go on hormones this afternoon, it would be 5 months to be exact. I actually started proms. I went to the LA Freakment Inc. I went to Dr. Victory. I got a prescription for, , Prim-Rion 2.5, The Pills, the Roo Purple Pills. And, , I waited into my insurance kicked in in middle of May and my job. And I went out and I would pop my first bottle of problems. I was just so happy. I really wanted to swat a whole bottle. This. Taking hormones, which give them breasts, redistribute fat and more feminine way, soften the face, are only one part of transition. There are all kinds of unwritten rules to keep the girls in check, and mainly they center around appearance and passive. When someone recognizes your genetic and male, it's called getting clapped on the west coast, or spooked on the east, and no one ever wants them to happen. Some girl I talked with described having some guy in a restaurant, a dude, and she passed by, and it was so traumatizing to capture from dressing from months afterwards. So the girls are always monitoring each other, keeping an eye out for bad makeup or fake looking boobs, and sharing craze on anything fishy. Think fishy is the highest compliment you can get. It means you look  you were born that way. You were born girl. It starts to be voice. If you really want the sushi boys. that can really destroy the whole am it. A lot of times you can have all the makeup in the world, but if you look  a break, are you just that passable? I mean, what does it mean to look  a break? The little  a break, that's turned out a lot of girls used as far as a man and a dress. That means that you may have a dress and make up, but yet, it's so obvious that you're a guy. They... Say that to each other and they college with her? I'm yeah, yeah a lot of them say This name is she's breathing in that That's how I had a girl say that Do you think that girls are a critical of each other seems to mean when I see them from the street? There's a whole lot of criticism right away Confitted for a certain image House is by my side people and students, friends. If I go out with another girl that is as as fast as I am, because for one thing, it's bad enough if you get clocked, if you put another girl that is not as fast, but there's a kitchen clock, you'll be more that brings yourself to see down. So a lot of girls in myself, you can go out and publicize less tasks and girls, because it is in great predictions. It's in great, great art. It's hard. but you have to realize I think. Better change in your woman's bed and not. So why would you want to put more guess-linging fire? There's a certain strip of Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood that box says it's been a drama. It's where straight, often married men come to pick up young transgender prostitutes. It's also where just-out transgender kids often first spot their own kind, and can imagine a place to blend in. They hang out at Benito's and all night talk-o-stomers. Kids will stand around and gossip and laugh. Go turn a trick, hang out some more, pop into nearby ass-pubs on an alcohol guard. It looks so good right! I do! I love her senior! When Fox and I- dropped in at the needles this month. She ran into her friend. She had a little senior. Where you live in? Where my little? After my man, I've got a husband that I've had for two years and you've got a house. Got an apartment and the months will be slow so we've got to come up with half this month's rent. You still got to go come up with next month's rent on the first. You're working on her. So I don't work all the time but just something. I know that's going to go. I mean, sometimes I work, I have to do it too. No, oh, that's not good. Oh, it was so loud that I've been here. Girls have just arrived in Atlanta. I might show up here to socialize for a few weeks, and then turn it to a person flash. It's by then that they've learned how hard it is to get a Richard and each job when you're 17 and have both a male ID and a seek-up breasts. So sex work becomes the option. It can be dangerous, especially for the younger ones. Some of whom have been kicked out by the parents of 13 or 14. and are looking for a place to stay in the top of the ocean. Box used to work for a lot, so now she's moving on to office jobs. Whenever I do work for a little part, when I have to work for a lot of companies, to get money for that point and time, whether it's to go to studio time or whatever. It was so I really try to stay away from the boat park. I worked it all well and switched up and saved the job. But I basically, I think it's something else that goes to do because I'll keep this. So one thing we got salt after is  the number one type of employee cell. What is it  trying to get a job as a young pension to persons? It can be very frustrating because I would say last blow jobs I've been in. Last, yeah, last blow jobs. I've had a big pop with these limits, which is  genetic women. They can be very supportive. as our organization, because I was thinking of giving us tips from him, but it's  when it comes to the bathroom, this is , it's  we just shoot it there, first space, I don't understand. And the last two jobs I was there, a lot of women can have problems. It's best for me. I'm , okay, I look  a one. I am built  a one. I rest , you want me to use the bathroom too. I mean, the house. If anything that's gonna mess up, a little kid, just a bit poor boy, points the rest of his season is really nice looking, Jennifer Lopez looking  hungry, standing up, urinating after the year. That's gonna just destroy his whole heart and sad. The girls on Santa Monica make $300 in the night, but we'll talk surprisingly casually after they have a pellet. For some, there's a bit of a thrill to tantalizing the straight man who would normally move off of him. And for others, it's an unfortunate pause on the past day one. So many girls come to San Francisco, and they have that pretty warm and constant. Oh, I'm a glad you're worked full of iron on your feet and rich and girer look alike. And he's of the amelian area, he's of the married and their ham children. I think that's a lot of girls really think. They have that pretty warm and constant. Do you have that fantasy? I'd tell him that elbows don't double. I'm not actually very hopeful and hopeful for that. Have a little more here, they want to stay down here. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm here. Everyone, come on. Everybody, come on. Watch me do my thing. Watch me do my thing. I  it. It's Friday night at Fox's Tiny Studio apartment. And while Fox sings and wraps with her friend, Ateedam, to have her dragged daughter, 15 year old Angela and 18 year old Ariel. Are getting ready to go dancing in an underage club? Luckily both kids are petite and the onset of puberty has been slow Their faces are stopped and in their clingy nylon dresses Bob wigs and knee high boots, they pass amazing well They dress  any Latin high school and our way they be doll cute But a little more trampy than a long one They love creative So she looks pretty yes you too Jack There's an area  a handful of other local kids keep their wigs, heels, handbags, and makeup and boxes out . Angela and Ariel both still go to high school and live as boys during the day and don't want to risk getting caught by their families. While some of the other teens live on the streets just don't want to get their stuff stolen. So Fox's place is a sort of de facto dressing room, come for a house where kids come in and out, dress up, eat boxes food, get some other advice and help and crash on their house. I was there for hours watching them do and we do them makeup. and fluff and gays into the mirror and pull in the astonishing number of gobo boots out of process process. You don't have a bronze? It's a water bush so they can look big and soft then at the same time when you walk they've double. They filled their bras with water balloons. Hormones would give them breasts in a matter of months and would add weight to their narrow hips and back sides but for now, Nader is started taking. There's just riding black market for hormones here in the line. And  many people. description drives that are purchased over the counter in Mexico, estrogen smuggled across the border in the sold in the swap meets with other Mexican pharmaceuticals. In the rush to fill out in past, girls will shoot massive amounts of hormones into their bot's happy, often causing CMS accrued schools. Sometimes, they'll also inject silicone and oils directly into their hips, butts, knees, and even cheeks, ultramarmed apple heart from juice. There are a few doctors who will prescribe hormones to tips, but they're waiting with survival and some feel. the dosis and chicken serving. Fox has gone legal route with nested in prescription and her doctor tells her to expect breast about the size of her mothers. After all, you can't and re-region at us. This particular Friday is special. The girls are celebrating Ariel's entire night. Ariel is 18, small, Latina, and even when she wears a baggy boy clothes, looks  a shy little girl, and curls her. herself into the chair when she talks. She tells me she's decided to retire. Her staff dressing and leave is a boy for one whole month. See if she can make it. Tonight is her last night to try. How long are you facing her ears? Be hang it ears and you're named. Really? Really? Really? She knows she's... Ariel named herself after the little mermaid in the Disney world. For so many transgender kids, Ariel's engaged the little mermaid is hugely significant. After all, the film came out in the discussion. The cartoon Ariel is a mermaid who hates the lot of things. Someone's nothing more. She was living in the ocean and she wanted to be a human being. And then she turned into a girl. She stayed  a girl. She looked  a flat. And then she went for what she wanted. And she did what she wanted. And she did what she wanted. And everyone's happy. We will happy. her sizes. it'll be  my mom telling me you can be a girl you can do this make her. and and foxing says no way airs retirement is my class. she remembers her own teenager and how she would iend of opera season. I hope you  it. Today was, I don't know if it was the right blow, which is a depressing game. A few days after the retirement pass, I met up with Fox again at the event. We drank a cool, it on plastic cups, and sat on the second home couch, shades gone. Everything just needs to be coming together now, but I still have this... and be in this inside of this apparently Valentine's Day came up plus I broke a zombie right after that and isn't making things much better that I haven't had my first relationship yet. Whenever I see Poff she talks obsessively about finding boyfriend. She's visited psychics and grilled all her friends for leads and can't figure out why nothing is planned out. As she's gotten older transitioning into a woman is no longer the central drama I've getting a boyfriend. Today's story is typical. She tells me about a guy down the street who introduced himself as Christopher Columbus. He told her she looked good and they exchanged phone numbers. But he never ended up calling her. It was probably at least some month after that he's still in call and I was walking down that same block and he was out with a bunch of strange. And I wanted his friends that day. I wanted to talk to him and say, hey, what's up? And the guy that identified, he's a subscriber of Columbus. I know where I said, that's a man, that's a man you're a guy, you're a guy, you're a guy, you're a ugly, you're ugly and I just walked away and my heart was just so broken and  now every time I passed by his house and he was standing outside with his friends or something he still cheesed me and I said in the savings  that I'm on the left. Last time he taught me how to  three weeks ago and he asked me, let me ask you something, have you at a cutoff game, who was referring to it, but it's a surgery hand. I said this person, and I guess that means we have an antichart and that's what I'm playing. How do you handle that inside of this and that kind of rejection? Well, it's been an inspiration for past songs that have written. Fox wants to be a huge star. She's a singer and a rapper. She spends all of her money on studio time. According songs about coming out and being French and wanting the world to understand. She imagines being someone who's sex symbol to and knows her future boyfriend will have to put up with that. She constantly worries about when that boyfriend will come. She's a singer and a rapper. It was a few weeks after her 21st birthday. Fox called me up all excited. It was finally happened she got everything she dreamed of. She told me she had met a man actually they met a week ago and he was now living in her apartment. This really exciting I mean it's  last week I'm single and now this week I'm boyfriend he's cooking from me and I'm falling love with him and it's falling love so it's always happens a bit. It's  a dream. If you're any question anymore it all about straight guys going to transgender girls. Remember these girls are fantastic and horrible. Fox's new boyfriend Sergio 23. He's a Puerto Rican guy from New York with an X-White and a daughter. Fox is the first transgender woman who's ever dated. He's straight and sweet and totally not. I even told him that he's , I don't believe he's in time to respect it. You're so fine and you can get any real girl that you want to. But yeah, you're here with me. As one of his exactly as I know thanks forstawington話! How do you feel when she's so good at you to get any real girl? Well, I should say that maybe she's really well-doubt but at my feelings, I think more fun so , I don't know, yeah, I don't know, yeah, I don't know. I went to the gym and that's something. Sergio was listening to my song, it was a real girl and he made a comment that just struck me. Enough. I forgot when he said what he said baby. Oh I say you don't have to be a woman to somebody  me. Because my dear, I don't see what she has, I'll say I see that this is something. Look at you. See, this is. I will say, the heart doesn't see only feels. When I tell people about this book project, they all want to know which of the kids are really women or really men. By which they mean, who has had the gentle version? But the surgery is irrelevant. Lots of trans men never have it because it costs 70,000 bucks. And plenty of trans women,  clocks, don't want it. It's funny, feminism has worked so hard to prove that women are more than what's in their pants. But when it comes to conceptuality, it's all people can think of that. So I countercrewedness with crudeness and asked them, if you somehow gotten to an accident, and lost everything below the race, would you be any less woman? Any less man? If you think you're a woman you are one, we're not used to that idea. We're not used to believing that gender is determined only by our hearts. In Ariel's case, she couldn't suppress this heart, and her retirement turned out to be more the past than you were born. So the last time that I saw you, you were signing to the tire and stop dressing and how long were you going to take your tire before? Promenh. How long did it last? It lasted for a little reason. A few days after her retirement party, Ariel's friends started calling her, asking her to go out and dress up and take pictures of that. So she went and it felt great. Let's get her to talk her in talking. I think I did. It's  I'm , I'm gonna go to hell. That's what I think I'm ahead of you. Why would God disappear? Because it's just in the Bible there. You were born a man. Did you learn anything from your retirement? You learned how to call. Did you learn anything from me? Yes, that I'm a boy. That I'm old of you. I'm a boy. Ariel is struggling back and forth, dressing some days as a boy, and some days as a girl, or gale to me. Ariel as a boy is withdrawn. Lincoln vacantly and drowning in baggy hide everything jeans, he almost disappears. But as a girl, Ariel is vibrant, believable, sassy, claiming space with her walk and challenging to move her eye. When Ariel was going to a rough university school with her years back, she tried to be tough in masculine. But the boy still harassed her for acting too girly, and she had to drop out. To get even, she showed up one last time, and pressed up as she says, hoochie, at a tiny dress in heels. The boys didn't recognize her as she walked around the quad and some even asked for her member. I love this appliance, this revenge and face of such a dream. Ariel recently had to be for sister's house in South Central neighborhood because neighbor boys once again were threatening to kill her for acting today. She's now living across town in her own apartment with an older transgender woman. Ariel still not. But the other day, she did calm me up to see if I would take her out for 19 weeks. She wanted me to find her a wish. Crispy name is Rida with me on the Sandeless. These days, Fox Chusell has a day job doing street outreach to transgender youth to hear her music.

And how to load your position, the moment you get that first job, you can be sure that 18 of your probably strands were simply calling you about how to get your spy novel published. There's something so alluring about becoming an author. It's something so daunting and agmatic about the process of getting published, but even the most accomplished men and women will travel as it happens at industry. Power and the poor. This is how the greenest publishing recruits end up editing intermusing of gangsters, telling millionaires to fill their darlings, stelt shaking and craziness. And this is how, with little training, or experience, and only a vague idea of what I was doing, I became the professional literary agent for the world famous movie star. Mr. Bruce. You don't have a ghost in your mouth. That's fine. As a zagiant I've had to explain them along. Rus Campbell is an actor. He was Ellen's boss on Ellen, Jack on Jack of all trades, the Talicus King of the Use on Zina Warrior Princess. In the movies, many act cop-one and many act cop-two, he played the cop who was not an actor. He's a sort of actor dies in the first 10. minutes of the movie Condor, which he gave me. The music you're listening to right now is the theme from the adventures of Bristol County Junior, in which Bruce Campbell played with Palbon. He was canceled that for one season. They still use the theme song though, from time to time to introduce four to the events people will soon use to be a win-pitch. The song is one of the things about, perhaps you've seen a movie called the Eden from Beat. of its two sequels. He will dead too, dead by dawn, there's a character named Ash, whose hand is infested by an e-conspirator. After the possessed hand slaps him all over the house, he cuts it off with a chainsaw. But it still isn't him. Ash goes out to the workshop, and what follows is one of the great parodies ever to be filmed in class. If you're over it's ready to cast montage, close up of Ash gathering his tools and ammunition, and then you can modify the chainsaw. which he then straps onto the stump where his hand was to be. Pulling the rip cord, he uses it to saw the end of the double barrel shot and he curls again the powerblades pile around his street computer, puts it into a hole star on his back. Because the chainsaw's engine wars, he stares into the camera, and deadpains the immortal one. Who the... That's, there's him. And with that line, he'll be movie star, he's one. Because if you don't... What no who Bruce Campbell is is a growing circle that devoted fans who do and who want to move him. They build websites in his honor. They make recruiter maintenance with his picture on himself on evening. When Napster was on his last life's past spring, the only thing he did be sure to find there were German drinking songs and Bruce Campbell's most famous Lawrence. Ruby, this is my boomstick. Held a king baby. Held a king baby. Good. Bad. I'm the guy where we've got a girl. Tub ile substitusta ki il worship I got moves to you pal, you ain't leading the two things right now. Jack and Jack left down. On their own or dropped over home made tecno music, they're the passwords into the inner circle for the cult of Bruce Henry. The cult is nearly equally men and women, perhaps because Bruce's charm falls somewhere between Harry Grant and the three stages. Maybe it's because he's not very well known and appealing to these your own personal no no. knows about it. Even if you're aware that Bruce Campbell had a small army of batten fans, there's something about him that makes him think that he'd ever had a chance to meet him, the two of you would definitely be in a mighty, much worse, Campbell and Bruce Campbell. That was my line of thinking anyway, in early 1997, I was a young literary agent with never sold and a Bruce Campbell thing. That screen my office finally was slipped at the something I had only heard whispers of foam, the world blind plane. It didn't do much for office productivity. But on that first day I typed in words Bruce and Campbell and changed my name for Rebellion. It turned out that Bruce Campbell had his own website and by his own I mean his own. Not some slick corporate product, but a homemade looking affair contained by volunteers and he three long essays from Bruce advised for inspiring you because notes on how much orange can't. cost and film festening, reports from the set of the Kale's native, a terrible Tom Arnold movie, no gaming, whatever you see. There was a link to an email address and I clicked on it and I stared at the empty form. They didn't know what to say, but then, of course I do. I'm not only a fan, I'm also a professional literary agent. Have you ever thought about writing the book? I didn't really expect him to write back. It certainly never occurred to me to this book nonsense and be something I'd ever ever have to think about again in my life. But after all, one man's Emovi God is another man's lonely working as a defactor, stuck in New Zealand, Phillmingsina, War of Princess, taking digital pictures of the strange, sudden hemisphere electrical outlets, and posting among the Internet. It must have been boarded as a man. So the next thing I know, I'm chatting with my hero on a crackly overseas connection about why the world must hear the confessions of a beam beam. People of celebrity dreams all the time, David Letterman was into your apartment building, the Pope calls wanting to know he needed to catset. But this phone call was the real thing. There I was telling him how a book proposal was written, what Nellard does, and what... the other end of the line, it's Bruce Campbell, saying, -huh, icing, the proposals. When he actually said groovy, it was very misled. I wanted to draw our conversation out in part because I thought I would probably never speak to him again, but I also wanted to end this quickly as possible so I can put it behind me, make it into a story, get back to my normal life. So do this, I even tried to discourage him. probably know I said I've never sold a book for me. But when we hung up, it was noting I wouldn't go back to my normal life for a long time. Somehow, you don't remember me. I had sold me. After that, it was all then new. And for a reason that I was too much of a fan to anticipate. The nature of being movie starred in and such that it can be a celebrity on one hand and a nobody on the other. And I would tell that it's hosting a horror movie. by expo, Bruce Campbell may not be able to get a rest in the lobby, but in the convention hall is a living dummy. Turns out though that most of the editors I sent his proposal to don't live in the convention hall. They live in the lobby. If they were aware of the world and the roots of the star, it was only to take the time to see me. Even those who were closet Bruce fans  me were either unable or unwilling to take a stand and let their geek price for them. So this project which initially seemed to spell easy money. for both of us gradually became people to some of his younger generations. Which put me in a complicated position. I had achieved my dream moment for his first call to me, the rest was brave. But now, against all common sense, Bruce was interesting to me with his dream, and I was letting him down. It was time to bring out the big rooms. First we say in publishing, it was... time to bring the pope on the catson. Bruce had to put himself in front of those few remaining editors who hadn't passed, make the feel as giddy as I had during that first phone call. He had to come to me. I had obviously always wanted to meet Bruce in person, but not  this. Not only the sole reason for his coming was because I had to date, but in failing his so I tried to distract him. quick tour of my office. We reached my cubicle at the top of the stairs. That's me. I said, we could play a few small wheelchair. We were just going to dinner room. As we walked on 6th Avenue, my girlfriend and bruises wife and little ahead of us, bruised and I painfully tried to move small to move. To dinner, I finally got the experience every bruised hand of Ben dreams and Ben. It was hanging out with bruise. Specifically, I was eating hummus with him. Was that sound exciting? Of course it has these. Everything was along completely in Dream Life. And that's what made it great, where two couples have been dinner, talking about the book Speed Red. The only thing that skewed the night slightly towards Suriality was my shaking knee for a cigarette, or it was holding on, I thought I'm really sending you. But even after, when bruising his wife caught me in my girlfriend, frantically lighting up on the street, it wasn't me. They all had a laugh of me. The book finally sold to the last editor we met at that day, the one who had brought in the Bruce Campbell issue of Pangori amagazin for an autograph, for introducing Bruce Rampen's bosses. Actually, he didn't even buy it at that house, he had to quit Bruce and take a job in another company and then take his boss before he could even make a modest company. He quit me at set. It was a huge weight off my shoulders. It's not usual for a book to take on was two years to sell. weeks. I was hoping that Bruce didn't know this is keenly as I did, but I could never use him. If you're someone's literary agent, the one piece of advice you can't hear from his, go get a good literary agent. The day we sold the book I was on vacation with my girlfriend, who might have been dating for 10 years. The next day, I asked her to marry me. We can invite Bruce. Hey Bruce, how you doing? Greetings, greetings, Andrew. Thank you. I see you, right, good? Yes, I brought to a few sandwiches. That's nice. It's been four years now since that first email, and I'm visiting Bruce in the Yorker hotel and Manhattan. The book is about to come out, and Bruce has come to push it with a Q&A and autograph signing in the Tangoria weekend before. Then you'll see him! I'm not a fake in community for various reasons I've left the business. The Bruson I've stayed in touch. And we've got to use to run and go. I want everyone to stand up. Stand up. Everybody's single one yet. Raise your right hand. Repeat after me. I. I. Stay your name. I. Stay your name. I. Stay your name. I. Bruce's famous for antagonizing his homies and they love it. They love him. And this room, Bruce Campbell is the biggest star in the world. His book is the most important book in the world. Now I am as a steamed tongue. His former professional literary region. Are there any plants for evil that fall? Alright, so we're to never have that question about that. As the convention continues, Bruce signs posters. at shots, DVDs, loop- scripts, faired breasts, anything the fans enjoy. The line goes to the back of the Roman alphabet door. In this crowd, there's almost a paternal sense of crime, and even concern, the filipurus has never had the big break of the serves. Your brothers? Are you a Bruce Campbell fan of this one? Oh, big time, yeah. And my brother and I were , it's  our aisle, basically. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. We eat for much, , drum-plotting, all the more movies, and that's , it's called the, , Well, my brother over with the whole even that series. I'm kind of, I hope one day that, , really big and then money into stock markets, everything, I'm gonna click, , my studio , for example, yeah, I'm gonna make the start with one of the real big movies, pop and ash. Right now, I'm a freelance writer, but I used to be a literary agent. And in fact, I represented Bruce's book, I sold his book to really publishers. And I'm doing this show about how, , four years ago when I first... started talking to him about doing a book. For me I had the same impulse was wanting to bring him to a bigger audience and you were saying how you'd  to exactly yes yes that's awesome that's really really good I just think it's interesting because obviously other people feel the same way that he deserves more exposure he definitely deserves more yes definitely he's really it's not not exactly reality so you start the studio you get a Bruce Campbell vehicle going and you hire me to do the book hey guys the World peace We got a hangout at the end. This I realized is the paradox of all those MPs who want to reach. They all want to hang with Bruce. They want to earn it. They want to help you. And it's because I hit and I will have done exactly what this kid dreams are. But I wanted to do it. Help. And then hang them. Finally, mention is over. A few fans tried to shout over us after his room, but he evades him. I, however, instillated the following from the back pasties and freed elevators who was for contact says to us. Then we run into some trouble. Bruce's key card won open his room door, and the organizer has to be dead and have him programmed to confess. Bruce and I stand there in the shadowing hallway, locked out of his room. He seems fidgety, exposed. They're still quite a few fans from the round, and now I realize. And one of them, I'm not as agent when the organizer comes back with the key, Bruce will go in to change that after the airplane. I'll go back to my apartment, watch him on television, just  I did before I ever went in. Pretty soon I'll run out of closet works, he says email him to call him. Do you get the special treatment I've come to expect from my friend, and move his room? Is there anything you want to do for a thing? ... They got it in their head about saying these lines about what  what lines  in a groove here give me some shirkers and those are tough just because it's a feeling Plus it's  we're in movie that's where that's where comes from that's the original I would just be giving you sloppy seconds Which is a good no come on no you're all literally agent I said no John Hachman, listen to your Bruce Campbell's book is Chins Cook Hill and Business, and Support, especially for typo… Do not miss out on this show. See that full danger To everyone. That great. Harry Alcheran, Shimon Paris, David Ben Gorean, and me. We've heard about a number of different kinds of dreams in today's program. There's also a kind of dream that we have protect ourselves. I'm seeing who we really are. December 3rd, 1986, Wednesday. Another fascinating day in the life of Adam Beans. I have a map test tomorrow. I'm going to school early to tutor a girl in my class for the aforementioned test. My math class, a joint precalculus and calculus class, consists mainly of seniors not especially interested in learning. I guess that I'm the class expert on quote in the... And I always do the math problems which no one else can. And for this, I'm disliked. I guess that because I apply myself, think clearly, and do a little work, as well as some intelligence helping out, I am a geek. In truth, I am far from it. When you first read that to yourself, when you first saw it, your reaction was, it was pure horror. Recently, Adam Davidson, an occasional contributor to our program, found his old. high school diaries, Adam's mom is Israeli, his dad is American and I'm glad in New York. His body was in New York. His brain, as the diaries reveal, somewhere else, entirely. I remember when I was writing it, I remember very clearly, although I don't say this in the diary, that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of this week. Me. That I would one day be prime minister, and it would be very important. for history for people to know the deep thoughts of a young Zionist as he prepared his way to lead his nation. Now our regular listeners are in this American life. I might remember that you've been on the program describing your experience in Israeli Army Summer Kim. That was right before I started writing this time. Wait, wait, wait. Sure. There's so much wrong with Jews and Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me. One thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews. This attitude sickens me. You Jews of the world stop worrying about money and well-being. I do not know what exactly I'll do, but if this situation continues when I'm a bit older, then watch out world Jewry here comes Adam. Watch out world Jewry here comes Adam. He's a home in California. Let me see. Wow. Yeah. It's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership. I know. , that's what's kind of amazing. And that readership is world-juerated. Yeah. The Jews of the world who won they read this book and will say... If he knew this at 16, how could I be living so bad with him? Can I say to just read one of the passages we've talked about? Is it? Sure. Let me see. I mean, I have this thing from January 4th, 1987. I memorized the hope, Hattikvah, which is the Israeli National Anthem, a few minutes ago. That will help me in Israel. I'm not making any of that. Amazing. Here I am, the shiit-prime-in-use of Israel. What are the things I need? Oh! I need to know the National Day of the Porn, to recycle it. There would be a ball game or something. It's in the Potsinger. You're right exactly. At 16, I had such an inflated sense of myself. There was so much going on in my life, that I can remember. And I wasn't recording it. Instead, I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of, , I'm not just a 16-year-old kid. and  having crushes and  the hopeless geek who can't get a girl with kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything goes through that. But I don't know, I mean just maybe, maybe keeping a diary with one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain kind of person in a certain kind of situation. Maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually. make up a little thing. Yeah, I think I didn't have much angst about being the future prime minister of Israel. I was very calm and confident and comfortable with it. And I had so much angst about every other aspect of my mind. And so I now see it as just kind of maybe it was a good solution. , it was a good way to deal with this, with what I was knowing through. I had this space where I could just be, , one of the greats. I wonder what the 16 year-old Adam Davidson was feel? It knowing that finally, , an audience million people was getting some of the reading from this diary. I think this would feel so small to that system. This would feel so nothing. This would be so unimportant. See you in another video. Weeknd. on a radio million people what's a million people . Yeah, I mean we're talking about his we're talking about he and we think changes. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that yeah that he would be fairly impressed. And Adam what what would this 15 year old you think of you now? I think he would be really disappointed. I think he'd be really sick because you're not the prime minister of Israel. Yeah, because they just have such a small life. I remember I was very disappointed and very sad about my parents. I was reading biographies of course of all the crime ministers of Israel. I would just think about my parents and just think, how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people? How is that enough motivation? Have your petty little craft and your petty little feet. and they were small little apartment, , , it just seemed to... And, I mean, they have the kind of life that, , I mean, basically, I want for myself. What you're saying though is that the 16 year old you would be cringing at your 30 year old, right? Just as your 30 year old version is cringing at the 16. Yeah, that's very true. Yeah, it would be very, very disgusted. Be heard this, this right for me. It would seem  I had settled, not pathetic, what? At a Davidson in Los Angeles.
