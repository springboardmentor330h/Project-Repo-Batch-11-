So it's something I asked him what is the music? What is that? And he said, well, that's the music from his country. We were actually five of them the right was Somalia. We talked for a while. And then he says to me, that's my wife. I say really. He says, yeah, she's still back. She's a singer at weddings  that. And he was here. She was there. And he would drive around all day in his taxi. Listen to her saying, how are you around on the road thinking about him? Missy. I think you're true. I think you're true. Out there on the road right now. Now, this tape line, just one of the many people on the road right now. So much of the life of this country happens in hard. So much of it. Imagine for a moment that people look down for all the streets and avenues and windy country roads and highways for above somehow. Highway, quickly, you've seen the vast meadow spread before you.

Though he's about to spend over $100 from paint job with car. I'm gonna go from, I gotta dress to you. I guess three. Tony turns to his friend. I  to take her out. Tony, you're gonna regret this for the rest of my life. Yeah. It's very dreadful data on it.

The car floor is cluttered with empty mountain dew bottles. It's a car-it-packs of cigarettes. From the door of the car, signs attached. Look at these split messengers. Well, red light. The car's relationship to me is definitely... they don't  me. They hate me because I think they're really scared and paranoid about driving with no hands talking on my radio and next stop at the same time trying to write something down trying to look for an address and I look at it as a big video game, You have so much time to pick something up and drop something off in this time and then you have all these obstacles in between How do I paper boy  the old video game  I'm saying? Yeah, I've hit a few higher hydrants and a few people and a few different cars and and you get points taken off for that. I must say, dude, I told me I'm going around that.

And people, , they cut and in and out in front of you all the time and, , talking horns and yelling at you, cursing and stuff. And if you listen and this kind of take. You come, you're alive, you just say no. You stop, you let people land you, you're just... To me, it's equal to a martini that's from the go-home, and it's said I had a martini that you're loved.

The last one is you've been driving. It's definitely the first stage she's a rejection. I'm wondering how this is going to come out. I'm thinking that the government's wrong and that K-Lang is right and her baby's going to be born alive. I do not think it's going to cause massive diseases. But I have a feeling they may start a colony, the mothers, and fathers of these children. Let's hope we'll do more. and the guest in a few months. I'm partly in another world, not the parts that need to be driving car, but I get very involved in the stories. I often listen to very involved things. I'm in the middle of a 20 book historical fiction series that takes place during the Napoleonic Wars in the Greatest Navy. And I'm in, , book four, about to start book 14. And I talk about going out.

You're on the road right now, in your car, listen to the radio, hate a look inside cars around you. Each one, some little bubble, it's on tiny subculture on wheels. Bye! and steel worlds, probably down the street, alongside each other. Today at our radio program, we take you inside, there's other cars on the road. We'll be Beezish Kago, a public radio international, it's American life, our class. Today in our show, we have lots of tape recorded inside moving vehicles, plus original stories by Nick Corinby, David Cedaris, with parents and kids, a longtime buddy, drinking beer, increasing the neighborhood on Sunday morning. If drivers are safe, and drivers who do not want to be saved. The entire American road system is laid out before us. And let's start right in Chicago on Chicago Avenue for the number 66 bus runs. Come on, Luke, come on! Tiger, allow me. The English name is... Let's see here for a while. The little Pearson is 40. Outgoing. The Ruchi Drive Chicago Avenue has from the point where the city of Chicago touches  Michigan on the eastern edge of the city. Out to the westernmost edge of the city. Ruchi that is six miles in each direction. So long and slow to drive that in a late hour. shift, she only drives it back and forth for times. She's been a best driver for six years. I was little. I didn't think you could back up off. I didn't really think about it. What's weird is when you're in your car. You pull up to a bus stop and you get really open to do what  and you will. I'll see. I'll see. Well, I, , sometimes running and coming straight to you, starting to slow down because you, let's leave you. Okay. Oh, big shot. Yeah, it's playing with both. Then we use fly right behind. Hi, Mommy. How you doing? Yeah. That's my mom. Yeah, that's my mom. Let's move on. Yes, man! Okay, alright, Lambie! There's our teacher, I'll teach you guys around the market, on my SS 911 AR inside your left hand, so let's do it for a phone call and shift your 90s. Oh my goodness monitor this. I'll introduce what you are life and what you just starts. 正ump norte! This is where I grew up in. Too much. You're not going to lose for me. I just have. I've got one. Exactly too much. Let's just say this is our first round. Pointless school and this is our way to O. And , anything really have to do right here. One deal. The grandma school went to the block down there. That's one of the neatest things about being a neighbor. There are times when I see people who are to school with me. And they'll get on the bus and I'll be , I know you didn't even do it from all of them. It's not  that. I  to play it. That's  25, you 23 year ago. Thanks. Start from all aspects. Have a good one, babe. Thank you very much for your steps. HP really nice when we do that. And it's  really good. It's just a game. It's fun. Well, we've already moved over there. It looked  a lot of Polish people that lived here long. And that was about 30 years ago when I first moved, first moved over there, south of that town. Now it's only black. , you might be a lot of beautiful people. Okay,  when we were in high school, hey babe, step on up. Every softening line went up to ask us, these two stand outside the bleep for the bus. And it would be so many of us and we were a panel around it. The bus driver would tell us if we were in high school. Not always had, but take it easy. So what happens is when I get in that area, I kind of  this, I'll laugh, even if people look at me , what's the oil? But even when you're at, you must be  the dress guy every day. Look how they just  a high-time at the air. But then , I think it is exactly this is where I grew up at and I've got to come for one. The NLP Peterson. She says on her days off, she tries to keep away from the root. She got to go have no. And they should look at my nose andashing right in your body. I even have to work on the screen. The whole screen. Because when I used to, I used to come on Chicago and I was , Oh, there's a bus. Oh, he's out of place. So, you just remember so much. Now we're going to stuff that happens when you drive out here. Or lanes. Baby, I'm done, you're done, you're done, you're done. Baby, I'm done, you're done, you're done. Baby, I'm done, you're done, you're done. The cross-the-ocean in England, cars are driving along the wrong side of the road. One of them, an emerald green, four-door car that we would call up in jail, that they would call it, pleasure. Excuse me, Nick Hornley. So, it's a lovely sunny, crisp London Sunday morning, I'm in the car with my sun-bany. Do anyone see? and autistic, leaving loves the car. It really is a public, nobody does. When it's strapped into the back seat, say, no other kids can get in his face, they do after the world, that people fly at him  Asteroids towards a space car. And nobody will make a leap to feed him, because it won't reach. And the side windows of the video tape that more than it needs to change. He likes to know where he's going now, so he's memorised all the significant routes. This is a kid around the occasion. remember the sequence beginning ready and steady is completed by the word go but somehow and these somehow's constitute enduring misproved autism. He's managed to construct a mental street map of the entire London metropolitan area. The route to school is on because he likes to. The route to grandma's house is okay too not only because he likes grandma but because she lives 50 of Martian London so he gets to stay on the car alone. The route that's not okay. is the root of the park. The park's two-place chrome which means that the journey is open before it's properly forgotten and someone at that cross is that we're making get out of the car but it's a lovely sunny Christmas summer war. He starts to yell at the top of the landscape in Canada when we don't turn left into more stupid stuff. turn, it sees a slasher chance, the school was all about 10 minutes ago when we didn't turn into a little road up across the Holloway Road at Greating Park. See, all many streets takes you on to use the road and used to roadly, eventually to motorway as Grandmaskas. But from the Lanzi street, it has straight across and to reach its park by on our way to Primrose Hill. Doesn't that sound nice? Primrose Hill? Not to Danny, the Lz get louder when we stop the reach of sweating using pitch. my husband is still. Come on, can I say in my best fun voice? We're going to the power, the swings, the sea saw. He just turned the yellow material up to the left. I tried to lead him out by the hand, but he slaps his away and grabs hold of something to see now. Anything that will anchor him inside. So if I take the power knife and cast him in the small body, the power has one end of the family alive, the other, the three of us are  the warrior family in the TV so. I end up dragging my son out. I was able to do it. A couple of look at this is a very warm pass. They don't say anything, but one day I'm sure someone's going to report and I'll be arrested. There's a certain iron to this. I learned to drive at the age of 41, entirely because it's a family. I didn't really want to learn and I've a mild, potent, a hot plant. The public transport that served me well all my adult runs in life is becoming less and less. panic loves going on trains and buses. But sometimes it didn't want to get off. And sometimes it wanted to get off the car at stop. And sometimes he decided he didn't want to wear any trousers on the top deck of a number 19. And that was one of his backings of the, because I'm bigger than him, I wasn't always in the mood to fight them. They can be very strict with his anyways, he's fight to this. Down his best friend and class mate Tobin wants to come such a possible dozen. Head, head. the addresses, they have to be held down by his mum and his lanyl, at which point the woman ran over and started pummeling him back with her fists. Sometimes I silently dare someone to say or do something, just so I can tell them why I'm having to be so cruel and hopefully make the little terribly in the process. So anyway, I took driving lessons for 18 months and slowly slowly overcame my fear and nothing, I found, after every awful, occasion, be careful, 6km from now. the Vemens drape is more dramatically how much I love my son. I passed my test first time and I bought a little Ford or Perjard and I thought it was love so I could drive into places  the park. A busy grateful isn't held. It's all going on to his seat belt with the air life and the screaming will I try to pull it back and onto the plate. Eventually he can hold on no longer and I lift him out and put him down. After a brief pause during which he recovers his command. and Potion stops here and draws off towards the park gate. Because another thing Dennis did not want to tell us very second, is he loves the park. He loves the swings in the sea so it's spinning around and around on the grass and in his dizzying. And it's a lovely sunny crit for Sunday morning. And hey, there's an empty swing and literally within 10 seconds he's full of smiles and happy and there's no trace whatsoever in his face of the ankle pulling trauma to which I recently called him dead. I'm the one to find the couple who may or may not have a surprising look on their faces when they saw me coming from your flat to planets. They showed them just how if you're with them using them, the course they never ran. Which is maybe just as well. This is in the wild. I'm going to find a way to get another bit of a sweep. Nick Corinby is the author of High Fidelity, and the Bout of Boy. Back on this side of the Atlantic again, not very far in one. On Cape Cod. And a green Volvo sedan, Jay Allison drives us to start a really ice skating lessons. She's 12, which means surprise, in the car they do not agree about what radio station to play. Are we gonna be late? She's a part of a lion sedan, that is ridiculous. With the song being winding. I feel that she is not already. Why is she a tube? I feel  I'm not always ... I'm not always ...

Bubblegidium International is when our program continues. American Light from the past. Suffin said that this country was rebuilt in the 20th century to accommodate automobiles, as cars we have the suburbs. all's highway system, much of the physical and commercial structure of this country. And so, cars are so important. Today's program is made up entirely of stories that happen in cars. That's I'd  to introduce a few times a week in an 88 Mercury Grand Marquee that he inherited from his mother. Senator Conrad Burrins of Montana picks up random passengers from Virginia, drives into the city during his rush hour commute. Having people in the car means... to be contrived in the past lands, set aside for the cards that are full. Tell me the conversations also. What do  what issues are on people's minds? Politicians, I think, have a big problem. They've never learned the lesson that you can't hear with your mouth open. , it's interesting what people talk about, especially, , but they always notice, , sometimes they notice the Montana plates and they'll say, well, you're from Montana, and I said, yeah, I'm the, they ask what I do. And sometimes I sort of just don't answer, so... I gave him some sort of a non-larscript answer and wait is the non-descript answer? Do you just say, I work in the government, something  that? By work on the hill, I tell him I'm one of the ants on the hill. More or less accurate? I would say. I have a New York City, Jeff Perkins, tape recorder's passenger, and we'll look at the satin sheet. Just pass the car. He's quite the country devaluess team. I'm trying to kind of focus on a particular subject which I  to ask you about. The subject is subject of dreaming and I'd  to know if you dream vividly or do you remember your dream? Sometimes I dream of it. Actually, when I was in my early 20s, I was having a recurrent dream of my family being editable. I had dreamt that my mother was a big mutant, and that I was dating Mr. Nevisco. And I had also called dreaming that my father's feet were made of roast beef. And that he would sit in his usual chair and play thought pieces of his roast beef to feed us with. On the other side of the country, our dreams come true, Los Angeles, cars flew along in the 405 from the camp. From our beloved Viennperson came out west, got a first Hollywood job in one of those cars. On the mid-1980s, BMW 5 series, big heavy car, who was the driver for a movie producer named Pico Sherick, was head of ABC back in the 60s. When I introduced lots of films, I correctly cared the step-for-rise. is the so-called Woody Allen's first movie taking money in Ron. Driver in this world, the job where you train to the Indian producer yourself, which I would be in one in. So now I'm going to take care of the car, do I have to be scripted, set in on meetings, go and do everything. Part of the idea was that I would shout out here. I was expected to know everything he was reading, I was expected to know who he was calling and why. And he would ask routinely, , why am I calling this person? Not just a test in the bus, in the way. slip his mind and oh yeah why am I calling this person? now it has to sort of because you want to ask me about this project or that project. So if you didn't know  it was your big trouble we a little scared of him oh yeah oh yeah I mean he was a sort of larger than life he said that when you smoked big human to go which would have to get from him. It's a contract band and we had to get them from Cuba. And that was part of your job. Yeah, yeah. We had to get them from South Africa, which was  a double note. Wait, wait. So, really? Because it's during the embarking of part-eyed. Yeah, so not only you're getting contracts, but you're getting them through a country that was, , that you didn't want to be doing business with. So, not as we were getting through Canada too. Which brings us to this story. Some people do their socializing in the car, just cruising around, running errands with friends, seeing who's out.

Okay. but we come together on a weekend. It all comes together basically in the car.

They are really getting harassed. They're not getting harassed, man. Police just came around the corner. Man, we should go around and see what the business is. Hey, what up? Oh, don't worry.

Some of the most important moments people's lives happening cars. But sometimes we are not aware that these are the most important moments in our lives as they're happening. David Cederis tells this story. It wasn't anything I'd planned on, but at the age of 22, after dropping up. out of my second college and traveling back and forth across the country a few times. I found myself back in Walley, North Carolina, living in my parents' basement. After I'd spent six months waking it noon, getting high, then listening to the same Johnny Mitchell record over and over again. My father called me into his den and told me to get out. He was sitting very formally in a big comfortable chair behind his desk, and I felt as though he was firing me from the job of being his son. I've seen this coming and it honestly didn't bother me all that much. The way I saw it, being kicked out of the house was just what I needed if I was ever going to get back on my feet. Fine, I said, I'll go. But one day you'll be sorry. I had no idea what I meant by that. It just seemed  a sort of thing a person should say, and they were told to leave. My sister Lisa had an apartment over by the university and said I could come stay with her as long as I didn't bring my journey in Mitchell record. I'm mother offered to drive me over and after a few bones he had said took her up on it. It was a 15 minute ride across town and on the way my mother and I listened to the re-grodcast of a radio calling show in which people phone the host to describe the various birds gathered around their backyard beaters. Normally the show came on in the morning, and it seemed strange to listen to it at night. The birds and questions had gone to bed hours ago, and probably had no idea they were still being talked about. I thought about this, and wanted to find anyone back at the house, and talking about me. To the best of my knowledge, no one had ever tried to describe my voice of a shape of my head, and it depressed me that I want to notice while people were willing to drop everything around. My mother pulled up in front of my sister's apartment and when I opened the car door she started crying which worried me because she normally didn't do things  that. It wasn't one of those I'm going to miss you if things, but something deeper and sadder than that. I wouldn't know it until months later but my father had kicked me out of the house not because I was a bomb. but because I was gay. Our little talk was supposed to be one of those defining moments that shape a person's adult life, but he'd been so uncomfortable with the most important word that he'd left it out completely, saying only, I think we both know why I'm doing this. I assumed it was because of the drugs and I'd left it at that. I guess I could have nailed them down, I just hadn't seen the point. My mother assumed that I needed a true and it tore her off. Here was another defining moment, and again I missed it completely. She cried until it sounded as if she were choking. I'm sorry, she said. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I figured that within a few weeks I have a job in some cramming little apartment. It didn't seem insurmountable, but my mother's tears made me worry that finding these things might be a little harder than I thought. The Giannister think I was that much of a loser. Really I said, I'll be fine. The car light was on, and I wanted what the passing drivers thought as they watched my mother's saw. What kind of people did they think they were? Did they think she was one of those crybaby moms and fellow hard at the time someone shipped to Koppita? Did they assume I'd said something to her? Did they see us as just another crying mother in their stone gaseong, sitting in a station wagon and listening to a call and show about birds? What did they do? imagine, for just one moment, living might be special. Hey, if it's a derousin-slight, I spoke as caught, me talk pretty one day. And I'm writing up the obvious I draw a card that you wrote In an art sense And the people are cracked Go, Av Only Love to Kind Make I call the Love to Kind Let πα If people are out next button no other purpose with no other purpose.
