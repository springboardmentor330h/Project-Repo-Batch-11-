  "text": "But Kamaiyethe, who joined the country, led us to have the rational, adult conversation about Sam Koss. He was introduced to a special Christmas edition of the American Light, which would be an easy Chicago, and public radio international, on our glass. Let us head back to the background. Back for a moment, before Christmas lights were invented. Back for Macy's Department Store goes up on 34th Street. Back before the moment Charles Dickens writes Christmas Carol, back to the molten lava ağ for a very center of modern Christmas. Today, someone first will be in Santa Claus. Someone is actually figured out when this happened. And it's in 1822 in America, in New York City. And you didn't have thanks for the whole thing. A bunch of rich guys, and not just any rich guys, a list of credit rich guys, so I would read that would be big problems with the entire American experiment. Then very young. Then more young. to them, and the star was to the G. Is to us. And these guys did not  in one little bit. They were very suspicious. Democracy, modern capitalism, Thomas Jefferson. They just saw his chaos and as a takeover at the city and really no country by the mob. This is Stephen Mismal, who's written a history about all this called the Battle for Christmas. Ordinary people, by which he really meant to them the middle classes. We're taking over. the city commercially at politically. They call these people the mob. One of the dreadful areas of the mob rule was what happened at Christmas in the end. There was all this public rally in the Christmas. That's you who celebrated the way we celebrate New Year's Eve. Yes, exactly. If you were worried about the mob, the one time of year when we probably had a being most on your guard was the Christmas season. During Christmas, robbing bats, toughsman from door to door, demanding drinks and making threats. It was right. that is noise making, massive public truckiness. If you understand why these rich guys just hated it, and so they sent it to create new traditions. Traditions that they hoped might replace all this debauchery. Starting around 1810, they tried to convince people that a certain fourth century affixing, seen Nichols, and they recognized the name, was in fact the patron saint of New York. For about a decade after that, they tried to make his same stare, just December 6th, into a regular December holiday. on the island of Manhattan. Now, these guys are very serious about the whole business of creating new holidays for the new nation. At least one of them has involved in the creation of Washington's birthday, Columbus Day, and the Poghiguan. But this same Nicholas thing, it was not catching up. And if you saw the way that they portrayed the Nicholas and hand out that when these guys had printed in the 2010, you might see why. That picture doesn't look at all  the modern Christmas Sam. of course that we know. In fact, he's a very dignified, match-stereo bishop. He's in clerical roads. He's in clerical roads. He has bishops, miters, and scepter, cross everything about him. Looks  one of those medieval saints. He has a halo around him. A Saint Nicholas comes to punish every bit as much as he does to reward. So Nicholas appears in the book in 1809, in a couple of columns over the next few years. It is not until 1821, as somebody mentions in the live in John Christmassy, who describes in the slate who vire reindeer. One reindeer in this case. And then, in 1822, one of these rich guys, a man named Carmen Parkmore, changes everything in rights of power. How do you ever get to say that? Each. changes everything and he writes up home. This is the poem that begins towards the night and for a Christmas, run all through the house, not a creature was staring, not even a mess. I actually find it kind of incredible in reading the history that, , a century and a half of later, that the poem that actually created seemed to cause is one that is still overheld. Yeah. But what he did was he transformed St. Nicholas, utterly no longer in this poem. and his Saint Nicholas, a dignified bishop. In fact, there's nothing bishop  about and he's rather short. He smiles, he's fact. A guy who just loves kids. It's all there in the palm. He's stopping somewhere with care. The reindeer's names. The fact that he comes down the chin. And note saying this course, the next time that you hear the palm. For a coat, a short pipe, a bag that he carries over his shoulder. Ordinary Yankee Tricks. Not a bishop. This was the key to the whole thing this embounds says. This takes him out of the aristocracy and makes him a regular working man. Middle class even before there was a name for middle class. Perfect hero of the new nation. And come in part more, didn't have any idea how popular this vision of Santa might get. And so incredibly, he didn't publish the poem. He just passed it around to a few friends. So if he had wanted this too. But. The American ritual he probably would have taken steps to publish it, but he didn't ah, story hasn't that a niece of his ah took her upon herself to publish it the following the year and a newspaper and the Hexin River Town Troy. And it was republished and republished after that. Within a few decades, the Christmas described in the power. Christmas ended. They're Santa bringing toys, kids with parents, all indoors. That Christmas replace the big, drunk and loud, corralizing out on the street kind of Christmas. So, the aristocrats got their way. They killed the noisy version of Christmas. Who accidentally? What's the day on our program? We bring you stories about Santa and many ways that you're seeing. At one, the red velvet underground, image one, great man. It's up to death. Desert, to vessel with devil, named Oz. two, if this slays are rockin' and they'll come and knock in, which Sarah Valle explains why so many pop songs just Santa getting all jiggy, three. It takes a nation of sanders to hold us back. Story of two little boys, and we can hope that these have school with Santa, for Santa, Santa, and taking a class from BTS and chains, or from. proud to present in all new story of the most fantastic crime fighter the world has ever known. The single handedly heads him to part and started to become a searcher stop. He read more than us. Five. Santa versus the Easter Bunny, which right your David Sedaris tries to grow cross-cultural understanding. So, better we needed everywhere these days, my friend. Hold the holiday season. Stay with us. The one, the redicum of the Underground, we begin our program today with a story with the most idealistic possible vision of Santon and a quest for something lost about Santon. I don't need it. I guess I'd somehow become okay with the death of everything. The death of faith, honor, idealism. I thrived in the country club of the death. of everything. Until a newspaper headline caught my eye, Santa faces the sack. So when he deals with Manhattan fired at Stores Santa, the macy's was adopting interactive and poll . Santa Claus was on the verge of extinction. I got thinking about that and I don't know if something in me kind of snapped. You can't recall the exact Christmas that part of the way it was in. I'm not sure how I lost him. He's a kid and his oldest a boy. brothers I believed in Santa Claus way past it when healthy. I was a fanatic. At the slightest provocation I defends Santa's honor with a flurry of punches against any nascent elementary school punk. My fervor was pure and scary. I remembered that feeling now and a new one thin, a wanted-back. There's a couple weeks before Christmas. One minute and I'm fussing with your cyclables, living with constant suits of basically normal life. In the next, a clean brown package arises the door, a little gift that sent me a cell. Something I'm not sure I want the neighbors to know about. I'm 33 years old, and I bought myself a sand suit. It's a strange moment in wrapping my box, cardboard and paper giving way to rich red cloth and noodles of white wig hair. The stairs of humor really can explain something  this to them. people in the night. What? You can infiltrate the sin underworld as sin in yourself. The name of proving he exists. See you down to the point. Here's what you do. You stick that sin to suit in your garment bag and go. Do that momentum, take your body, block it from the tarmac, turtle it through space, the satellite, and land it on another planet. Change. A place that looks a lot  the whole cell. It's been so to actually, but close enough. The night before my first appearance is cloths, I take my sand suit and calm back. It's a d-lux model with luxurious, deep red velvet, faux fox fur trim, wax bats to wear over my boots. And sand sunglasses with little square plastic lenses. To be fit my belly, there's a big cushion with a catfish. Protector. Christmas in America means a trip to the mall into mall. I'll show up at the biggest one I can find. The malls, the mall of America. I've already been given a crash course in Santa 101 by the mall star Santa, but it doesn't matter. I fall asleep with pains and doubt. To have what it takes, what the hell does it take? morning comes in auspicious start. The costumes hot and itchy especially the waging beard. You can tell you're saying that you never know little things about yourself. I'm a real peripheral vision guy. I  to know this coming out in the black jacket. Also I enjoy oxygen. Trapped in all that synthetic filament and find myself gasping for air. Finally, I'm perhaps most in, I don't  being the center of attention, at all. A mumble of people, I'm really in half-hearted, hell-ho-ho-ho's. The tempting something more theatrical, I look my hand and wave and canocally. Ah-ha-ha-ree, crees-smiles, every one. It comes out as if I were just off the boat from Castlevania. Moving on, I spy a group of older kids, maybe 12-year-olds, wearing baggy teams, hope love. The link in skateboarding newest types. My first impulse is to try to slip by them and make it seem as if I'm linda shopping. If course I'm not. In fact, that they're looking at me with fires of response. But before I thought it true, I actually hear myself addressing their leader. What's up, Pes? Someone giggles, everyone else starts backing away. The sober and depressing thought occurs to me. I make a sign. You can play half of them to service to Christmas, my value of drives and for it. A curiosity and secret shing out of righteousness, mad purpose. I take to the sky and spirit of claws, make house calls. New York arrived at Barcelona to tap me. with 50 volunteers street corner cringles on our way to Santa Parade. You got to get down with the people. One of them, a man named Socrates tells me, you got to jingle in for the Chachine. You California, I lay a reef on the grave of the Great Jewish Santa Hermine Fsteen. You would eat as lock as a mothable, and then suit up as big red to visit sick kids at a local hospital. He did it for 50 years. And then in Redmond Washington, I go to Microsoft. headquarters dressed as Santa, just to see. I can't myself on a corner in a Mercedes sedan pulls up. The middle-aged man leaps out piping mad. He's a Microsoft public relations person. He pointed me, Santa, and spotters. I am God damn sick of your guerrilla tactics. As if life at Microsoft is a constant parade of angry trolls and elves. I have a friend in Los Angeles named David Panch and when he hears what I'm up to, he decides to join me. He instantly comes up with a green felt elf costume, but impressive knee-high, he became socks and a cap that makes him look a bit  a Danish sushi. He's an unusual elf as six for three inches, but he too wants to believe. And a Christmas in Panchy. take to the streets with help to take a look at plan. We get in a rental car and track the planes to LAX and sunset. Then decide to meet and greet the hordes as they arrive from Asia and Africa. Even if Santa is in decline here in America, he's still big time abroad, and glowing in places where he would at least expect it. In baggage claim on received  a celebrity. A plate can tie one, they pat my stomach wide out, and so I share a good belly laughing them. Point for me, tips... They want to touch my impressive beard, flight them Sierra Leone, they want pictures for their extended families. When I wander outside, a cab driver pulls over and rolls down his window. Below my friend, Mr. Claus, who says, just drink for me to come over. Hello, yes, you are American. I tell him yes. But I hope, oh, oh, I'm also a citizen of all nations. And I live at the North Pole. Yes, a citizen who says, but he is, burning his arm. I hear his arm not peeled and intense and emotional, and no one knows I'm not looking for a ride he's pulled his banged up car on the curb to, to what? Say hello to Santa Claus? Yesterday I was a refugee from Afghanistan and today I'm a Sifston II. He reaches into his glove compartment, pulls out of fresh envelope. My papers Mr. Claus, I'm an American you. He smiles, eyes watering, grabs my hand. Merry Christmas Mr. Claus, who says, And then suddenly he's gone to more tail lights lost and see a traffic. Fancy I hit the road, headed east toward Vegas into the desert, driving a several bag of lunches because Santa's appetite has become miserable. Gassing up in Barstow, I chatted a nice spell on a cowboy hat with a self-serve, quiz him about the local color and these high desert parts. Do you  drinking? They're really only bars in bar stuff, who says, and I don't recommend them unless you feel  getting beat up. Still, there's something about the look of this place. The weird metallic taste of it being air. The dead ended and said it. So we take a drive around, me and my red cap, fancy this point we have. And happen upon a full corner with a cement structure. And neon beer signs lit in the windows. One of those promise-strepting tumble bars. barstep. It's a bleak Santaless place. Inside are a couple of cool tables, dark boards, and a long row of weathered looking tattooed human beings. Still parched after guzzling in that community or the drinks. The Santa bellies up to the bar, everyone's stairs, including the bartender, who says, what do you need? I'll have with these having Santa says pointing to the first broken down armbrake to his left. You don't have another. Suddenly, everybody wants something, to kill her, whiskey shots, to pack a cigarette, and Santa flutters more bills at the park and there. There's nothing reputable about it at all, Santa. It just is that thought of as a voice slurs over Sims left shoulder. Who the f*** are you? When it turned around, I'm standing those to those with a man wearing a camouflage jacket. The jacket. Long-stream hair falls from the space book cap. His knuckles are dirty and scab. His breath smells of mash and lighter fluid. His smile is lobstided, not friendly but menacing. OO the Holy Freakin' F***er you say is again. It's a fair question. One that maybe should have occurred to me before now. Before I came in here, looking as I look, and red coat, fake horny beard. So summit that. Th meat matter before barnstorming countries search for something that is nearly impossible to explain, perhaps more impossible to find, but boils down to a simple pollution, well, Santa. But then it doesn't seem to be a lot of him here at the Buysau. My answer is automatic, , the censored. I'm Santa Claus, I say, and who the f*** are you? There's some silence at the bar until somebody snorts, someone else could pause. And then,  a wave crashing and I'm ferolling along a shoreline, there's hooting holler and laughing that passes down the length of the entire bar. You hear that, boys? Sam is about to reveal you a new asshole. The distraction can be fuses my new friend. The name's Billy Byrne, and I'm gonna touch you. So it's a kind lucky. man with a van dyke and cigarette who is abruptly stepping through his. Because if he does, I'm going to rise head through that window right Billy. Oh yeah Donald, Billy says with a sudden smile. Billy but his drunk perhaps just bipolar enough to immediately forget that we were in the middle of a conversation for a passion and unanswered queries. And now we're suddenly chatting. Billy Donald and I. They're both homeless. Billy but Johnson saw this man arc. in the self-Christos. Provide them a couple beers, and in return they give me a crystal, a special Brazilian one with amazing properties meant to protect me against evil and bring light into the world. When I insist on paying for it, Billy Bud says, you money is no good with us, man. When you are with us, you are a brother. It's Santa's first gift. What do you want for Christmas, I say to Billy Bud, you're standing those to knows again. Seems that's the way Billy Bud likes it. If I tell you you can give it to me. Yeah, I am. Santa Claus, right? Anything? Anything at all. You ponders. It seems to speak. Stop. Yeah, I reckon we could use a few cases in natural ice. So I go with them, another one of their friends, and then who looks just  Santa too, but without the outfit to buy beer. After where we drive up to their encampment on a ridge north of town, just some sleeping bags and interbere tunes and members of the fire littering the desert. Somewhere that seems utterly nowhere. We'd buy presses a cannon to my hand. Here you go, Santa. Together we drank. Yeah. There's cold and this guy has spackled his stars, the brightest of highest point above our heads. Beer tastes salty and good going down, and when Donald offers me a cigarette, I take it, so I don't know how to smoke. When I go to light up and nearly sell my beer on fire. We talk about everything. About America, it's pretty as spots. It's most low down. We talk about home. Great is why we're not there right now. He's men dressed in dirty jeans and jackets, slugging natural eyes, open up to Santa, not to me, but to Santa. They're good people who've drawn a hard lot and then somehow have been to SNES, driven out of America to live at its forgotten magis. Not that they see it that way. Now the amazing thing is that they're standing here, the pockets full of crystals, they gave Santa his first gift. Now download the stocking bag down, now Christmas will probably be spent. right here on this patch of sins. We'll be the holiest, most blallicking, fierce going day of celebration that can put on. Billy Buds is going to cook a turkey with stuffing. Donald smiles at him and says, look at thanks to the Lord, but they're freedom for all of this. Then he comes up with a sky to the North Star. I know it don't seem  it says Bill, but we're looking for the answers too. Christmas Eve, I'm all somewhere in the middle of America. The Glom man dressed in a red hat and red jacket and red pants with white bird trim. It seems he's worn a Santa Rubbs for so long they could come comfortable. In the beard it almost feels natural. He keeps the Brazilian crystal in his pocket. He catches a reflection of himself in the store window. Santa. The people here come fast and furious. No one in reaching out for his hand now. The teenage punks strung out on something saying, Hey Santa, don't forget me, okay? The Jamaican man calls him Papa Nellau. He tells him he needs his life back for Christmas. The communal ages, the come to touch him, or stand nearby, flashy picture. to confess or ask at times to make it real. Every time you think you might feel tired, after all the hard work that bring the Christmas to the world, it feels energized. Somewhere near the Malfound, just beyond the food court, humanity parts in the light-filled grade, and there are two twin brothers clutching hands, wearing the same blue cordoroy overalls, pointing at Santa and complete shock and awe. They don't know whether to run from. or run far, far away. The penit doesn't take much. Santa comes down on one knee, nocons' arms, and the two boys break into huge, two-fless grins, and bust into a sprint. Just leap right into Santa's arms simultaneously, one night or arm. Sometimes people wonder what it's  to be sitting in a, , if it gets heavy carrying kids  that. But I'm here to tell you, you never felt something so , birds and they lift up and down, they're a one. We can all. My patterned EG is the perfect name. Version of the story is a period in S. Quiet Magazine. The story is a period in S. Quiet Magazine. We'll set it up to the city. The boy  me, The baby bring me some toys the other girls and boys Act 2 If the slay is a rock and don't come and knock in When the poem says the taint nick has a little round belly The chup one who laughed  a bowl full of jelly For most of us that is about as real as we want to get When it comes to se and getting off this goal. But the makers of popular music do not respect this simple boundary. No, no, no. And in today's program, as we try to understand all the various sides of Santa, Sarah Vald decided to explain this one. Even as a child, I loved Christmas songs almost as much as Christmas itself. I loved their arcane language, roundy on virgin, feast of Stephen, verbs  heart, and scream in the posso group. Take things off and stuff. Yes. Yes. Yes? Yes? Yes. Well. It's an important 20 years old side. When we talk about my future, what's the 2017 episode of Christmas this year? 40 these years, thank you goddammit. ンム. ! Yes? Didn't know they just took off something, because everyone just wanted to apologize, though. There was one Christmas song I couldn't stand. I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus. That one made me nervous. And it made me suspicious of Santa's good intentions. I thought, if he went after someone else's mother, mine might be next. I wanted to laugh at you. If daddy had only seen mommy kissing Santa Claus. Yeah, what a laugh. My poor, unsuspecting father, the man who went to all that trouble setting up the milk and cookies, catches mom in the act with fathered Christmas, what happens then? She ditches us, runs off to the north pole, and my sister and I are left key kids by New Year's Eve. I was probably 21 before I figured out that the smoocher in that song was supposed to beat the dad. But still, I saw mommy kissing Santa cloth. Is just one of them. Many gossipy musical reports about that sex part Saint Nick. A sweet through the Santa song catalog corroborates my childhood suspicion that Santa is not just a friend to children. He is a ladies man. Phrism. Phrism. December 1976 was Elvis Presley's final holiday season. It was my first with his Christmas record and this became my favorite Christmas song, rock guitar music that Santana and Naqubu decided to visit us next trip to this nice color event. is back in town. Got no slave with rain in the oven. No single mama. You wanna see me come? Hit up with me! Black Y'all! I hear that song now, and I cannot believe my parents gave me this as a gift on Jesus' birthday. It is filthy, but you could expect from my home record  Santa. Listen to this part. Hey, I'll be up to the start. You think that's dirty? In a load of clear it's Carter's song, Mac Dors Santa. And you'll know why Santa goes around saying, because he is a hoe. He's less interested in little children than in their mothers. We're able to build parents so that we can be alone. Leave the back no longer. So many of us spells amounts. It would no sound be in trouble. If they know children and adults, they call me back to Santa. I make my arms about to break a thing. Look at it. I make all the new girls happy. Wow, look at all that's happening. is what happens when pop music's in Christmas collide. The project of Christmas to celebrate the birth of a Messiah who will die and save our souls is that odds with the project of pop music. The project of pop music is love specifically romantic love and not the forgot so loved the world kind. If a pop musician is going to perform a Christmas song, here she doesn't have that much to work with from a let's do it point of view. There's the infant G. Jesus in swaddling clothes. There's Bethlehem that swaddled in town. There's Joseph and his wife Mary, a virgin, assorted wise men and animals, and their Santa Claus. From a getting it on perspective, you can see how the craigy old fat man wins by default. Take Madonna. Though most famous for being named after Jesus Christ Mother, Madonna took some time out of her busy missionaries scheduled to cover this earthy kit classic as a benefit for charity. It is not the babe Jesus she crows to, but the babe magnet Santa. Santa baby, Santa baby, Santa baby under its unique form in the air. In a normal, perfect girl, Santa baby, I'm hurry down the chute of night. Santa's job is to fulfill a child's wishes, and it makes sense that as a child grows up, she might wish for something a little steamier than two-protepe. A letter to Santa then is a blank page on which the heart writes what the heart wants. Listen for example to that six-foot tall Valentine RuPaul. So daddy kisses Santa Claus under his soul too last night. And I'll be sorry for Santa. is not live on the North Pole. He lives among us. Santa is us, with all our flaws, flaws lust, infidelity, and all the pleasures of the flesh. Experts no less than cheat and charm point out that Mrs. Claus' famous in their neighborhood for her brownies. Martin Maldas isong in which Santa's giving up dope. And here's the subtly titled Santa came home drunk. at the globe. You all know what is all about. I have to go and grab your words, now you're going to be the winner. Everybody try this the way my words. But I want to tell you books. I don't forget. I'm sad as I'm gonna make this house. It's not a big and good thing. At some point in our lives, most of us were at least a little afraid of Santa's judgment. Of that list, he's checking twice, who's naughty, who's not... Nice! What are we to picture a Santa with all our human frail T's, all our sex and drugs and rock and roll? Eat mommy kissing chimney comered down her bottle hitting sugar daddy Christmas. That's a Santa who would do well to remember the words of the birthday boy Jesus Christ. Thus say it the Lord. Judge not that ye be not judged. And  what they say about Jesus don't you Santa? Want all those human frails? It's  he knows when you're awake. He knows when you've been battered good. So be good for goodness sake. Sarah Val was essentially on the same law, locating, with time in part more the author of the poem, Twos The Night of Christmas, once lived on Manhattan Island, maybe two centuries ago. She's a calmness. for the online magazine, Salon. Music Music Music Music Coming up, when is Santa not Santa? Another little soft, in a minute. I'm a Radio International, when I program continues.

Smoking life in my request, each week in a program, of course, which is a theme. But it's very difficult for people to tackle that theme. This program, the Angel of God. where my red suit stories about Santa and the many different ways we see here. We've arrived at a three of our program, a three, a takesination of Santa's to call the SPAC.

She has never been so happy so he must take him off. all the time I'm known. He is the series from two large doors, rather than perpetuating the involvement of the martial thief.

There's a promise of grandeur or terror. In fact, it is this plain to me as the nose of my face that the man in the loose-fitting red and white uniform is the biggest imposter that I've ever enhanced the lay eyes.

This has been another exciting episode and the life of the most fantastic crime fighter the world has ever known. That episode of Chicken Man was written and produced for our program at the radio ranch in Los Angeles by Christine Coil and Dick Workin. The featured voices of Christine Coil, Dick Workin and Rod Roddy. Somebody stole my Santa Claus suit. Somebody ripped off my beard and boots. Some little fan soap, who is all dressed in red. He and the girls went to the pillow of my beard. Now, where my kids go to the school. Next slide. Santa Claus versus the Easter Bunny. A while back, Raider David Sidair was moved to France, where he rode in the school study French. He was the only American there. As he explained to an audience. at City Arts and Lectures in Texas. She would throw and talk to people and staff someone in the eye with a pencil one day and would hold your homework paper over your head and show everyone the stakes that you made. So I wrote a story about her and she read it and I got thrown out of school. This is another story about her and about the big religious holidays. And she's here arbitrariness of the way. to be celebrated sometimes. Easter eggs, Santa throwing the stockings, all the non-vegicide cops. Printed in our textbooks was a brief list of major holidays alongside his scattered arrangement of photos, capturing French people and the active celebration. The object was to match the holiday with the corresponding picture. Today's discussion was dominated by Russian nanny, two chatty polls, and a pouty, punk Moroccan woman who had grown up speaking French and a hoarse presidency. class hoping to improve or spelling. She covered these lessons back in the third grade and took every opportunity, demonstrated superiority. She'd recently transferred to the class and you could not wait until she was booted up to her appropriate level. Midway through the first day, she'd raised her hand so many times her shoulder had given out. Now she does lean back and her seat and shouted the answers. Her bronze arms folded across her chest  some great meta-魔 Ghost. grammar gene. We'd finished discussing New Year's Eve in the teacher had moved on to Easter, which was represented in our textbook by a black and white photograph, a chocolate bell, lying upon a bed of palm troms. And what does one do on Easter? Would anyone  to tell us? It was for me, another one of those holidays I just listened to the void. Going up my family, generally ignored the Easter celebrated by our non-orthodox friend. neighbors, leading to the suspicion that it might be either Jews or economists. As Greeks we had our own Easter, which was usually observed anywhere from two to four weeks after what was known in our circle as the American version. The reason had to do with the moon of the Orthodox calendar, something mysterious that, for our mother-only suspected it was scheduled at a later date so that the Greeks could buy their marshmallow chicks and pass their grass. It drastically reduced sale prices. The Chief Suns of Bitches, she said, They had their way to be desoligrating Christmas in the middle of God damn February. A brave Italian was attempting dance to the teacher's latest question, in the Moroccan student interrupted shouting, excuse me, but what's in Easter? Despite having grown up in a Muslim country, it seemed she might have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no, I mean. He said, I have no idea what you people are talking about. The teacher then called upon the rest of us to explain. The polls led the charge to the best of their ability. It is said one, a party for the little boy of God who called himself Jesus and, , that she followed her and her fellow countrymen came to her aid. He called himself Jesus and then he died one day on two morsels of lumber. The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pulp an aneurysm. He died one day and then he go above my head to live with your father. He wear it the long hair and after he died the first day he come back here for to say hello to the people's He nice He make the good thing and on the Easter we be sad because someone make him dead today Part of the problem had to do with grammar Simple man such as Paul in resurrection were beyond our grasp. Let alone such complicated reflexive verbs as to give of yourself your own and be gotten sun. Faced with the challenge of explaining the cornerstone of Christianity, we did what any self-respecting group of people might do. We talked about food instead. Easter is a party for the eat. of the lamb, and Italian student explained, one two made eat of the chocolate. I knew Brings the chocolate the teacher asked. I knew that word and so I raised my hand saying, the rabbit of Easter. He bring of the chocolate. The chocolate. My classmates reacted as though I had pinned the delivery on a house cat. They were mortified. A rabbit? A rabbit? The teacher, assuming I'd used the wrong word. Position their index finger on top of her head. Wiggling them, as though they were ears. You mean one of these? A rabbit? Well sure I said, he come in the night when one sleep on a bed. With a hand you have the basket  for a bread. The Moroccan world arrives on the teacher's sadly shook her head, as if this explained everything it was long with my country. No, no she said. Here in France a chocolate is glut, my big bell that flies in from... Rome. I called for a time out. But how do the bail know where you live? Well, she said, how does it rabbit? It was a decent point, Middle East, the rabbit has eyes at the start. Rabbit's move from place to place, while most bit. Hells can only go back and forth. And they can't even do that on their own power. On top of that, the Easter Bunny has character. He's someone you'd  to meet. A bell has all the personality of a cast iron skillet. It's  saying that come Christmas, a magic dust pan, flies in from the North Pole. Led by eight flying sender blocks. Who wants to stay up on nights so they can see a bell? I don't know. My fly went in for my own when they got more bells and they know what to do with right there in Paris. That's the most implausible aspect of the whole story. As there's no way the bells of France would allow a foreign worker to fly in. There's no way the bells of France would allow a foreign worker to fly in and take their job. That Roman bell would be lucky to get work cleaning up after a French bells dog. And how does the bell hold the candy because it doesn't have any arms? How does it get into your house without being heard? They just didn't add up. I suppose similar questions could be asked to the Easter Bunny. I just never thought about it that hard. Nothing we said was if any help whatsoever to the Moroccan woman. Clearly disgusted she decided there, but I don't remember if the situation is if the stat. And if without the language barrier, my classmates and I put a better job making sense of Christianity, an idea that sounds pretty far-fetched begin with. In communicating any religious belief, the operative word is faith. The concept illustrated by our very present and that classwork. My father struggling with the lessons of the six-year-old, if each of us didn't believe that against all reason, we might eventually improve. I'm not sure how that could seem. with a resurrection, but if I could hope to one day carry on a fluent conversation, it was a relatively short leap to believing that a rabbit might visit my home in the middle of the night. Leading behind a handful of chocolate kisses and a carton of mental cigarettes. A bell, though, that's fucked up. Here I'd spent all this time feeling intimidated by... French people. And for nothing. The next time the teacher humiliated me and someone at the market gave me a hard time. I just wore my eyes  a Moroccan woman thinking, well, what can you do with the nation of people who apparently believe in anything? I don't think I can help you. I think I can help you. Yeah, but they are awesome. And make the hall well saying, I wish you the understanding. But our program was produced today by Blue Shabby and myself.
