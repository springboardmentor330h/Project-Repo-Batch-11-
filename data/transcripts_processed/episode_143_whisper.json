  "text": "Then you're asking CalSkives to Congress for 36 years. Powerful Chairman of one of the most powerful committees, waste means. But if anything happened, he was sentenced to prisons or mail fraud. He started to meet people  one young man, one of the years old, who approached him in the exercise yard one day. And, , show, man, very young, good looking man, said to be, , the U.C. Residents all the time. I just want to know what my guess what you do though, so bad. He's the one. constitutional drugs. And say, why would you do such things? And you smile, I was going to go, oh man, you love him. It's okay. So what was the price you started for moving you throughout? She's , 10,000 dollars, I see. That wasn't a result of our body to carry a package. It's not the same, you need a straw. That means that's it. I said, what was your sense? 17 years. I said my gosh. First of all. To put this number in perspective, in federal courts, the first time rapists gets five to seven years. Kidnapping is four to five years. Second to be murdered is 11 to 14 years. And here's the thing. The young man was sentenced under a 1980s drug law that lost in tasky loaded for himself. It's a harsh mandatory minimum sentence with drug effectiveness, even first time offenders. Rustic has to be thought that the guys are punished, but locking them up from the end of adolescence until the beginning of middle age, it seemed excessive. The whole thing is a sharing in my opinion. It's not justice. It's this get-up idea. There are kind of something laws that put them in for so long. Can I still explain the terms in my opinion? there was a way to start the mouth congressman, then there's a way to talk about it. Why would there's a way to start? I can't tell you that, I don't remember. Yeah. I'm not trying to duck that question, but I was totally in a tunnel vacuum, the vision with my major distinction. And I expected out of the judiciary committee that committee that made this particular us to have the expert. In the Jewish year he can really give me the best clue. Listening to the debate about these things on the floor of our ship, there nothing. Not long after he got up prison, Ross and Cascini made a speech to lawyers in which he said he voted to these laws because he was quote, swept along by the rhetoric about getting powerful crime. A few of us had the patience encouraged to point out the public that there was relatively little that she had. changes in federal laws could do. We do the violent crime, neighborhood. So we acted, we got low bowels, and when I thought it happens. As a result, he said, we got up too many people for too long. And I don't know how to correct it, but , no, remember the legislature that I know will take this on because it's not popular. And he'll be criticized as being weak and the criminal justice system. Before he was put under investigation of self-rust of castes says he didn't really know about the sense of guidelines, he didn't know he voted for them. And in this way I'd argue, he is more  the rest of us than not. Most of us don't pay much attention to all the laws of the group, we do exactly what rust the castes did. They have some big faith that someone somewhere is paying attention. And if something bad is happening, it's legal. Fear is happening. somebody will tell us. But we often today are radio programs. This is steady how that faith failed us and where we've ended up. From WBZ Chicago, Public Radio International to American Light and our Giles. In the last 20 years, there's been a radical shift in the way that we sentence people to prison, mandatory minimum sentences, respects, route laws, laws, bouncing, 12, 13, 14 year olds to a dog court to move on to dog sentences. This is all this prison population has grown by 50%. and it's some point where another revolver news stories about her senses possibly unfair senses. And many of us carry in motion somewhere in our heads that maybe some part of this is gone too far. But , who has the time to sit down to figure out what it's out? Well, in today's show, we tried to figure it out and we bring you stories of places with a lot of things to be working just fine. where it seems fair. And stories about those areas, which there seem to be some problems. All our stories today are about drug laws at one of our program today. What's wrong with this picture? The story of how a person could be sentenced to 19 years for drug possession. Even if police found no drugs, no drug money, no residue, no paraphernalia. Even if it's first offense. Back to how we got here. A firsthand account of how and why Congress wrote these laws. in the first place and believe me my friend is not pretty. From a lawyer who helped draft the laws working for the Congress, I agree. We watch is the Watchman. 86% of federal judges. That's Republican and Democratic appointees both. I said the current federal sentence in guidelines do not give them enough discretion to set fair sentences. We hear from the judges. That poor. A night drug court. We heard at a typical evening. drug court here in Chicago and find a place where thankfully most people seem to be getting fair sentences. Stick around fellow citizen. I believe that you'll be surprised what you're about to hear. That one. What's wrong with this picture? This is the story of a case where the law work exactly as it is supposed to. This is our system working as we have designed it. Perfect game. Thanksgiving was living in Mobile, Alabama, 39 years old, mother of three children, working as nursing assistant. The father of her oldest child was a man named Larry Johnson. Dorothy says it's had talkative years. He used to fight every child support, his bad blood between them. And when he was throwing in prison on drug charges, he gave himself a lower sentence. He said that she was part of his drug drink. How was the  what the revenge thing? , as I read my paperwork and I talk about trying to show you how it is. he told me all for the heatball thing to get his own love. So, , I didn't know that. At the time, she and her children were living with a man named Tural Hines, common law husk. It was a working person, Merchett Stephen, and also came out with service with office. But he got caught up into truth, doing truth. , when I saw that he was following, I did my best to put him in rehab. And then we get out of it. Federal investigators came to the week with Darryt B. and a husband, part of the spurious medical care for Miami to Mobia. She was trying to possess him to kill us, crack cocaine, and just rub you. And campus is currently. Okay, they searched her house stem to start and did not find the first hen of residue and they looked for  residue, sandwich bags, cell phone bills, money, hidden, gun, hidden. nothing. And that is incredibly unusual. If I know paraphernalia, no drug scales. If I know evidence that she'd ever made any money, there was no evidence introduced. She had any money other than which she got through her maker job and the public assistance of children's problems. All indications was that she , we just live in on the edge public. Have a good night. to Kilo since they never actually found any cracker. Well, it was totally based upon, according to the agent, that testified what the Kingpin of the conspiracy said that he had stored a Kilo of Cracketver House on one occasion, and on another occasion he had brought a Kilo through and picked up a Kilo of powder from her house that's later Crack. So it's totally on what he said. He said, we're not true. Why would... say, what's in it for him? Well, cooperating witnesses gets substantial sentencing cuts in the federal system. It's the only real way to get your time reduced. And because he was a leader and I believe there was weapons involved in him, he was looking basically a lie sentence by telling on other people and by being valuable to the federal government, he ended up with a less than 15 years so he has a big insight. to turn in as many people as they can. Because there was no physical evidence. The case had been dropped to the state court. The federal rules were different. The federal court didn't need these problems. And the federal drug law has another provision. It's a matter of time. It says that if you have knowledge of a conspiracy, benefits, it has some time and role in this discourse. You can be accused of all. drugs, the valve and the spirits. So even if you just carry an unmarked package, one side of town, one other. Once you can be charged with the scene and out of drugs, it's person who ran the whole operation. For years, 30-40 drugs, she says she didn't do anything wrong and she says they have no real evidence against her. Just a testimony, once you've admitted drugged you. I got the longest time to anybody in the trial. I took you to the mind and I understand that the guy who's He used to running the program and admitted to a lot of church. He can't use it. And he had a previous record. That he's actually going to get out eight years before you go. In fact, can I, did you have a previous record going into this? I have no record. So what did you make it out? I mean, I'm still trying to deal with it. Emotion last year, trying to deal with it every day. I had 19 years of 7 months, almost somebody's say, I don't. No, yeah. And all these other people had it up and then scared. When I got still a film at that day, my kids were there to go with me. And when the George said, he didn't say 19 years, he said 235 months and I just did a function. I mean, I reached over and I asked him, I'm not sure, I'm not sure. And I said, what did he say? Say 235 months and I say, what is 235 months? I just did a thing and he said it's 19. you still a month. I just, I don't know, I just lost it out of the heat my kid is screaming the background and when the, , marshes took me out. One of the later marshes was crying and she said it. And after it was around, she said, see your son, hold on to the juice. Teaham that. My mother's all  that. Oh, still not way. So that was the most urgent thing. The US Attorney's Office, Southern Alabama, which is the Office of the Cross-Pet, kind to be interviewed on the story. But a prosecutor, acting as a spokesman, may be the Office of the Office of the Department, that the Office still contains the Chief's guilt, that it conviction as a student several fields. And as for her 19-year prison time, prosecutors said that when he began his job, he thought sentences  this weren't fair. But under the scene, the devastation, the crack of the prison has been found to slip. It is justified. We reiterate this in the box. One of the jurors, the Arctic case, told him a quarter that, while he thought she deserved a few years of prison, he was flabbergasted, she got 19. It was possible for him to be surprised because in federal cases  this one, jurors only determine guilt or innocence. They are a crisis of sense. Sentings done by judges. or a federal sense, guidelines. And at sense, the rules of evidence are much looser than it were during trial. Test the money that never made it to the witness stand. Things that were said to police that never entered into evidence. Criedably, even past charges that you've been accused of and found innocent of, in other trials, these could all be used to get into the evidence. And it is at this point in the process when the rules are so loose that the court decides to be mount of the drugs that you'll charge for. Tiny albums. of our sins. A greater amount of decades. Again, start to turn. I'm in the system a lot. I think the biggest abuse we still have is the amount of skip puffed because the quantities they get puffed up. What's the sign of that that thinks we have puffed up? What do you usually see when they keep getting puffed up? Well, you might have somebody caught with, let's say an ounce of crap. They're busted right hand that they've got an ounce of all of them. By the time they get to sin itsing they're being held accountable for, let's say, a kilo and a half, which maxes them out. But, you have to understand when you convert kilos to pounds, just to make a feel of stretch better, a kilo is 2.2 pounds. That each pound has 16 ounces. So you're talking in essence of 31 phantom ounces. How do they get boosted from one ounce to two hundred? Well, somebody says... And somebody says, oh Fred brought in a key, boom, there you go. And then we'll kind of set it to the... Well, depending on their criminal history, if there's somebody  Dorothy here looking at 19 years, seven months, provided there are no guns and they're not supervising you, bud. So, you mean, actually, you could get 360 to life on a first offense, 30 to life. And life in the federal system is life. You come out the box, there's... There are no problems. Nearly two thirds of our federal drug companies, across the country, have never been convicted of the violent crime. 40% of the first time in the country. It's tense and tense. Here's something else about federal drug law. There is a randomness to where it's enforced. Whether you're accused has a lot to do, where you will. Perth of the gains had the bad luck to look federal district that very aggressive targets drug offenders. So the Alabama, where the largest city is no deal, populist 300,000, depicted roughly the same number of federal drug offenders in 1998, is all of Los Angeles, population 3.5 nodes. Federal drug enforcement also tends to disproportionately prosecute minorities. They made up 73% federal drug addiction to 1998. According to 72% federal drug use. by white petal penalties are much more severe for crack cocaine for other drugs. This is reported Sam Pajas, in first road about darkness case, the Alabama Mobile Registry. It's just clear that a very high percentage of extremely high percentage of those infected or crack, which carries the longest sentences of all, are black people. And if you're in a federal judicial district where crack is the focus, it has been the South Alabama in a lot of crack cases. end up in federal quarters because the state court, then you're , then you're really up against having your odds of ending up with one of these very well-known gross instances. So up in that, I think we actually best the environment in which we're getting to this spot-up. In the end, our 19-year prison terms higher than federal mandatory minimum sentence for rate, kidnapping, right, the slave trade, criminal sexual abuse. child, second-rate murder, conspiracy to admit murder. Percentence had the same minimum as she would have gotten. She had hijacked a fine, bought and sold children. Just an opposite. , mothers and children that all you've done now is bringing up children to be bigger against the government. I mean, my son is very bigger. I know I never stole anything when I'm out. And he always destroyed this law and destroyed them. And how old were you kids? My daughter at the time, I was doing a task to make a use of a scum, a little bit Nine, and my daughter turned her with the level. And how are they doing? Right now, they're not doing a full business, possibly have to say, Are you trying to steal and step twice? Right now, they're trying to get in the cycle at you, too. You're trying to come around and you're stopped by the police officer. I was at the same car for the time being, we said that he wanted to go prison to join me. I always just find him that you want to get locked up, and we want me to get ready. You're in a different suit. There's some in Mayor and Account. Yeah. And how are they doing before you were? The floor was in cost and ready, my style was auto-student. He failed every year for the public's cost they're taken out. He was an honor student. So I'm on a roll. And your daughter? She tried to honor college, but after this we'll honor her trying to go to school and take care of the kids. So now she's on the dean, I'm a leader. She had a quick college and college a day. Take care of the kids, because she didn't want to be an app to them. You must feel  all the work you put into raising your sister's. She's the strong-trying right. You think our country's gone a little crazy and trying to crack down on drugs? Yeah, the countries don't all look crazy. They need to really check and see what's really going on. I mean, it's all right to tell you. I never thought you'd have to think what miracle would be  this. , now I'll waste it, my play it, but it's how I now think it would be a play it. How did the question be? Yes. Do they try to have you do the question be? No. I was right here, I mean, I'm incarcerated, but , I know I go the different things and they would say what let's do the play, but this is so behind now. Yeah. But I know too places, I'm gonna get out of it. My hope is very strong. Dr. Gaines, she recently lost her last appeal in the lab. She's good court. She's not your torture. She's one final chance and it's a long shot. just now I feel  the rest of the clip. I'm on my hip and I don't mind it everyday But she could go tell and I'll some higher Go tell and make my body I'm a devil in my mouth I'm a man, I'm a 10-year-old girl I'm a woman, woman, woman, woman, woman I'm more, dark than a dodgy It's fun, no Back to how we got to this point It's tempting when we hear a story Dark The Games to think of the tough loss to put her away for 19 years We're created by conservative law in order types, for public arts. And it would be nice to believe that part of the motivation for the vast side dealism. There is after a reasonable case we need to get in top on the premise. But in fact, the drug laws that didn't drive the games were not created by the public, but by Democrats. And as for how much idealism is it worth? Well, let us examine the history. It is an amazing story. That began in 1986. It was the 6th year of the Reagan. in Presidents. This is Eric Sterling. In 1986, he was the lead lawyer that came to drug laws for the House Judiciary Committee, which was about the Central Department of Environmental Ground. Two sides in this battle, on one side, Tip O'Neill and the Democrats of the House, the other side, Ronald Reagan and the Republicans, who had the Senate, the White House, and he could argue, parts of the American people. The bottom line was, the Republicans won in 1984 on the Crime issue. They have. had beat up the Democrats, they had attacked the Democrats, they saw former Vice President Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate, the President went down in flames. And so we now come to 1989 and 6. A year in which it is possible that the Democrats could retake the Senate, a year in which the stage is being set for the 1988 election in which Reagan will not be Did Gloria performance with his Democratic debate? And so in the overall national political calculus, Democrats are looking around for traction. And traction just means an issue that they can champion as theirs, so as to when people love them, it's about precise, okay? So in June 1986, at the end of the basketball season, the champion player from the University of Maryland, basketball team, then bias signs with him. NBA champion team for Boston Self-Hands team from the hometown of how speed it to for real. Bias, Bias, Boston, he's going to be the hope of the Celtics. Bias, Bias, Bias, home, celebrating with his friends and he dies in the middle of the night from over to the cocaine of some kind. Right. And a few days almost immediately Congress insurance, members of... the parameters go back to their districts for the joyful process. And the speaker keeps hearing over and over again about, , if a man in the peak of his health, a young man of such promise as Lenbines can die from cocaine. This is the proof of how bad and dangerous and evil this drug is in this drug for the moment. And this was captured. In the summer of 1986, the National Media had also discovered crack cocaine, and was kicking in full force, scare stories that the new Venice society. Deeper Neil got back to Washington, both did it to action. The Speaker convened the Democratic leadership, the steering policy committee, the chairs of the committees, and says we're going to put together an anti drug bill. It's going to be a Democratic. initiative and I want everybody involved. We're going to have a comprehensive anti drug provision and I want it out of committees before we go on our August recess August 14th or 15th. And this set off about a four week stampede they were called what got one month put together get ready. drug agenda and then you're going to go home in the middle of August and you're going to campaign to hell out of that agenda and we're going to come back in September we take it to the floor I will go on it and this is what we're going to ride to Electro Victory in no matter what. That's the point. And to make all this happen in four weeks just how how much faster is that then useful. It's warp speed. We squeezed into a month. What is typically a team on the process? So it's a legislative principle. Three days would be into the whole process. A couple of legislators proposed this idea. Mandatory minimum sentences. A radical recast drug law. If you were caught with drugs, it would not matter if you were a first time off with matter of their instantuating circumstances. The only thing that would matter. the amount of drugs you were caught with. Then the judge would give you a sentence whose length was imposed by the Congress in the laws. But it was being introduced at a point in which there was no longer an opportunity for hearings. We had no hands. We did not consult with the Bureau of Prisons, were with the federal judiciary, were with DEA or with justice department, to at least find out from those folks what would be the effective mandatory say on their wildly fixed footĲbery. The county law is one random enterprise of funding we wont have to go to the law because this what they are urging written by some of the needs to write from property of more $1.44 each dollars is 364. And the specific minimums that they chose, and could you just talk about one from them? I mean, how off were they? I mean, was it really so bad? I mean, was it just so bad at this point? The numbers that we picked in the industry committee, the 20 grams of crack cocaine would have triggered a five year federal minimum. They were public in. in the Senate dropped the 20 grams to 5 grams and raised from 5 years to 40 years because the Republicans were going to be tougher. There was again no sense of  it's not a large quantity of drugs from a consumption point Et節目 is marry. This film is coming. And this... folks who have really no clear sense of the dynamics of the business enough to make it just determination when you're just picking a number. One member of Congress when we try talking in terms of  real significant quantities and take in our city, you never have wanted that much. I can't go back and say I'm doing something about high-level traffickers because we don't have high-level traffickers. I think it was in front of the Pucky. That are comparable to what you have in New York or Houston or Miami or Los Angeles. I'm going back to my district and I wanted to bring something to the chief police. Because it's a damn great. This is going to help us. Among the staff and among it, the chairman of the other subcommittee was very usually very usual. very good rhythm in hearing our sides, my gutter evidence. I mean, the people turned to each other and just say, this is, what are we doing? No, not in this case. There's a way in which rhetoric crowds out rationally. If you remember Congress and you've spent a lot of time dealing with the minutiae of various arcane, ethyl programs, it is a, it's not simply a breath of the fresh air. really intoxicating talk about the issue of drugs with its good versus evil clarity. You can just  you can loosen up your time and start counting the table and you can connect with your constituents when you start talking about the scourge of drugs, the menace of drugs that danger that our children face, the epidemic, the pandemic. You're saying in a way that anti drug rhetoric is  a drug. Yeah. That's right. Why do you think you called one of these issues that crack cocaine politics? And while these laws are being brushed through Congress, it was actually a commission of super-minded people, Democrats and Republicans, trying to figure out a fair solution to sentencing all federal crimes. And then we're doing all the things that Congress was not through. They were not in statistics, they were talking prison officials. These judges and this commission was set up just two years before by Congress itself And it was due to present its comprehensive overall of all sentencing in just a year Congress ignored all that Congress also ignored a rather relevant bit of recent history which is that Congress had already tried mandatory minimum sentences drug crimes back in the 1950s This exact solution and it didn't work drug use went up So in the 1970s they repealed all those laws But unless you have a point with somebody say Well, , we tried this with blood power so that in 50s and then overturned it in the 70s because it was more I don't even know that that was raised in any more than an aside or in, , an paragraph in a background memorandum it was At that point simply not a consideration It didn't matter We were going ahead with this In fact, it was such a success, the two years later, Democrats did the whole thing again, rush the way to another set of drug costs, matter of rules. And this is where they added one of the rules that did end, Dr. Gaines, about that any low-level person who was judged to be part of a conspiracy. They could be sentenced to the same level that the leader of the conspiracy is. They have knowledge of the conspiracy, benefit from any way. , the brother was going to buy you a new set of shoes or... I... you're going to get some money, some benefit, you have some stake in it. That is sufficient to involve you in the conspiracy, and if you're involved in the conspiracy, the viable for the whole. A very profound change, again without any kind of hearings, I don't think people will pay attention to what the consequences were going to be, and it just passed. When you talked to members of Congress, What was you doing about it? Did most of them actually believe the anthrop drug rhetoric that they themselves were saying? There's a difference when you think about somebody doing some netflix this kind of law. If you believe they're doing an ideal risk thing, that is they truly believe that drugs are scored and someone must do something and doing it cynically, where they feel well maybe it's a scored maybe it's not but basically this is what I have to do to stay in office. business. I was never able really to have those kinds of honest conversations with the members. This is to ask you question  that is to close to asking, , , are you really gay? Or are you, I mean, we're talking about a extremely sensitive subject. I would say that the overwhelming majority members of Congress could use the drugs really are a squirt. But, they also, I think, there's nothing we can really do about it except we can need to get tougher. And I've fought them for that. Our challenge with drugs is how did deal with this phenomenon in a important part of our society, an important part of our economy, in a way that the system itself is not causing more wreckage than the drugs themselves are. But , to take care of the side of it, crime is going down in cities of across the country. The domestic factor of these laws is that crime is going down. So I'll say, but dope dealing is not a special thing going on. I mean, we're talking about a specialized type of law that the drug was. , it is still extremely easy for any body who wants drugs in America to get them. I mean, that's... in the real iron used that this is the one category of prime to keep increasing. We have almost twice as many arrests for drug crimes now as we did when these laws were passed. Eric Sterling quit his job with Houseby Dishary Committee, disturbed everybody kinds of drug laws that they were making. And created the criminal justice policy foundation, organization that's tried to get Congress to change it as well as pay its organization. Inventive to filies According to supporters of these tough drug laws in Congress to come into our program and give their side about this, both of them, public and representative Bill McCullen and Senator Orange Hatch both said no, despite repeated phone calls and facts as we will also turn down. But another supporter of these laws, Senator Mike Dwayne, of Ohio, the two senators office simply never returned our calls to anyone who showed that's the public and Senator Spencer Abelham of Michigan and John Ashcroft. Coming up, we hear about all the places where drug laws seem to be working fairly and judges, we get... Judges that's a minute of public radio international when our program is American life in our class to gonna put the course to be The variety of stories on that days program sensing stories of where I was Got too far one drugs It's fine. We've arrived to that three of our program actually Who watches the watch man Many people within the judicious turn against the carcinis and bloodstrips of current U.S. drug senses. The nation's chief law enforcement officer on drug use, U.S. drug are very happy. It's come at against them, saying they are too strict and in fact, it doesn't have 86% of off-federal judges, the school's Republican and Democratic appointees, since they want more flexibility to get their senses drug law, off-12 federal judicious. the past research as we consider wisdom and time laws. It doesn't have seen your federal judges have refused to hear any more drug cases, Judge Marl's last term, sudden district of New York, met her and have over 30 years on the ban. Stop hearing drug cases. It's not a couple of years. It's with regard to drug cases that I think the greatest in justice state class. They're almost all non-violent, and the offenses, but they carry very substantial all successes. Those were the case that was wrong touch. I don't find it so hard to send somebody to the prison for a while and crying. Touch Terry Hatter is the chief U.S. District Judge at Central District of California. He says that under the current federal guidelines, 60% of the time. He asked a word games. That's a bit word games to get to a share of yourself. 20% of the time he says, this final rule is not the sentence. He's the right sentence. A bit word of the problem he says is that because the sentences are set for each. to climb when the prosecutor chooses what crime to charge person with. Prosecutor is in effect choosing sentence and if you're in debt there are lots of cases where a person could be charged one way or another for a most severe crime or a less. We have two young women both young women live in the Mexico City, mothers, toddlers, they have been used sadly by a spectator for spouses, the carrier. innocent you asked the brains and drugs into this country. They were caught coming into the country. And what happened under the sentencing scheme was that the drugs were combined. You can know that one of them were traveling on their own tickets. They counted drugs collectively. Is that because they could be sent as part of this? Yes, that's right. And of course, they didn't have to be charged that way, but they were. And since they were, then they were forced to convert it, I feel  I decided on a move that was a good point for the military members of the military district. The young prosecutor has the ability which I don't have, which is a presidential appointee confirmed by the man who stayed silent serving for life. I don't have that that the young prosecutor can make a motion to go below the man to a minimum and the face is substantial assistance to be divided to the government. change the charge said one sentence. What can do them? It's trigger that my ability then can go below the manager at minimum. But you as a judge. I can't do it. So only the possible they can do them. I intended to give them harsh sentences just to go save involved in drug union two or three years. But as we turned out when... came back for Saturn soon and said to the one female prosecutor, are you going to make a motion for a down to the departure? And she said no. She wasn't at the witness's headnot cooperating with the prosecution papers, and told everything they knew true from. Just that they did not have much information in the Department of Drug Parents. That's the best case. Judge Hadder thought that was unfair, the limited block rate at the matches that possibly did, is not their fault that they had no explanation. So he thought that it allowed to sentence them a few years from God once in a minute. This was unprecedented and it turns out against the law, it was every turn on a field. Just another example of this Judge Hadder, how the prosecutor has more power than he does in the determined person's sense. Well, that's true in every case. That's true in every case, this prosecutor. makes the decision on how the charts are particular case and depending on what the chart is, we will work with the sentences pretty much. In the 1993 case, United States of America against Johnny Pacello, a Reagan appointee to the bench, U.S. District Judge Jay Spencer Rats, who is so outraged that he had the sense that 10 years were delivering a package containing drugs to a federal source of stress offers. But it's a decision in the case included this. It is hard to imagine there is any other nation, in which it convicted rapists, the long and unsavory history of prior misconduct, can be sentenced by the judge besides a restrial to a sentence which will make him eligible for parole in less than three years. By the defendant, first time a fender with a spotless prior record, stands to be sentenced by a congress who has never seen him and never judged him, who are minimum sentence of ten years without possibly parole. May if you are criminal. just a system that does not require not only those who accuse a criminal, but also those who sent and sent him . And, upon him, publicly acknowledged their acts as they're on to his face, his worse and unscivilized. It is barbaric. Act 4, a night in drug court. So before this show ended, we wanted to know how typical are the horror stories. How typical is the case  Darth Iganes? What happens in typical drug use? Other set-way up until this point we've been talking about federal drug laws. And while 20,000 people have addicted each year on federal drug charges, most drug crimes in this country have been state courts. 1996 it was 350,000 convictions in the state court. Some states are known for especially ruthless drug laws  New York State, but for the most part, state drug laws are usually less harsh and less rigid than the federal statues. Often they include a whole range of creative sense, options, and treatment programs, nation, can. So to find out what happens in a typical drug case, the American life through the Sanancian update went to state court. Chicago deals with its huge case load of drug crimes by holding court at night. The city decided 10 years ago that rather than... built new courtrooms to handle its 4,000 drug cases a year. It would simply open up some of its existing courtrooms at the end of the regular court day, and these rooms would handle only felony drug crimes. Court day starts up about 4pm. Current hours, so dependence have been heading up the stairs and into the seven-story stone forthouse down 26th Street in Chicago . Unless you work with 26th Street, this is not a place you have. up if your life is going well. As I was walking into the building the other day around 330, I passed a black man in his 50s and saw him stop in his tracks quietly throw up on pavement and keep walking. The court room I said in on is set up the sword of the round. The judge is destined as a huge curve at the top of the circle. The jury box sits at his right usually empty, there are very few jury trials in night court. And at the foot of the circle are two tables, one for the press, a fewters, and one for the public. behind the lawyers on huge pains of glass and behind the glass are defendants of their fans. To picture this courtroom, please don't imagine a majestic echoey space behind polished wood  in the verdict or some John Grishin movie. This room is much smaller and dims here. The fluorescent lights, bland carpeting, and 70s paneling on the walls. I'm not allowed to record anything in the courtroom itself, so you'll have to guess exactly what sound all this bad. pasties. The judge in the courtroom is Daniel Darston. I was born at Raised on the Chicago office outside. The Mr. the Army in 1966 came back home during the Chicago Police Department. During my time at Police Department, I went to the undergraduate graduate graduate school in Alaska. I got my love. Darston is a serious man with white hair who bears a passing resemblance to Andy Griffith. He calls all the Mr. and Miss. He hears about 40 cases of height. most of the cases 90% of the case are either small possession of charges or people who are selling 23 packets of cocaine. To other people on the street and then the reason is one is to support their own habit or to make the feud hours. Here's a typical case. Tony Bell was a skinny 27-year-old black man who kept rubbing his head with his hands. He stood in front of the judge and disappeared to me and was charged with possession of two tenths of a gram of crack. sweet mo packet, that's a gram. Two tenths of that. He had no prior record. The public defender on his case was Pablo de Castro. Tony Bell told me that he was standing with several other people out there, which is consistent with the officer's story, that as the officer approached one of the guys dropped some drugs and everybody scattered with him. We call it the slow runner cases. Everybody ran and Tony Bell got caught. When Tony Bell's case was first called, a ten minute step. But the city wanted to go to trial. Judge Darcy said, OK, and then put the case off to later to give Pablo a chance to read his defense. By the time Tony Bell's case was called again, and our later, he decided to plead guilty and take two years probation. Pablo said, Tony told him he was just tired of waiting, and that's why he wanted to take the plea. The prosecutor on Tony Bell's case, assistant state to attorney might go, didn't buy the idea that Tony was just tired of waiting. Think Mr. Bell. saw the writing on the wall. They didn't have any witnesses. We had a solid case. I think a judge at if he found a guilty trial would give him similar punishment because he has no background. So I don't think he felt he was losing anything but pleading. My code says he believes with all his heart that every person who prosecutes a night court is guilty. And probably to Castro, the public defender in Tony's case, doesn't exactly disagree. Or he'll joke about drug court as opposed to other assignments in this. office, but this is the one place where everybody did it. The only question is the reality of the search. Is that where you believe? That's not everybody do, but there's a lot of motions here more than try. There's a lot of questions about certain seizure where you're basically admitting that the drug's running is pocket. We're just trying to argue that the officers hand shouldn't have been in this awesome. I saw a hundred. five cases in nine hours at night before. Usually what would happen since almost no one gets in and out of the legal system in one day. Is it judged RC with called a case number? Some small action would be taken, a motion or an update on gathering witness testimony. And then Darcy would put the case off to a later date. This happened in 101 out of the 105 cases I saw. That left four cases, four people who did get sentenced. 3th up heep 토a patients and one weekend. I was sent to prison. He had a record of burglary and had once escaped from prison. Now to see how typical those sentences were, I looked at all the cases from the other five courtrooms for the two nights I sat in on Darcy's Room. Here's what I found. There were 343 cases total. 18 got probation and 21 got prison time. Most of them less than two years. Bye people! were recommended to boot camp as an alternative to prison. The longest sentence anyone got on those two nights was six years, two men ended up with that. One had already been in prison for Berberian sexual assault. The other had done time for robbery and also for, as the law definitely puts it, taking indecent liberties with a child. For the whole month I sat in on, August, 149 people were sentenced to probation, about same number as we sent to prison. on 44. Also, fully half of the defendant who asked for a trial in front of the judge were found not guilty. And a significant number of others were found guilty of a lesser crime than the one they had originally been charged with. The statistics for July and September were similar, about an equal number of sentences for probation and for prison time, and at least half of all trials ending in not guilty. Overall, examining these cases seemed fair. Any quantities of drugs? got probation for short sentences, even for second to third offenses. Large quantities of drugs, but especially a history of violent crime meant longer sentences. And dealers got more time than people just caught in possession of drugs. Again, overall it seemed a decent system. I had a long talk with Judge Darcy about his position in the state judge, versus that of federal judge, Sandy and Red Farms. I don't think the laws are hurt should all be state-law. So you feel  you have... the freedom that you need to give out sentences that you feel are just there. Yes, I do. Absolutely. Have you ever felt forced to send someone to prison for many more years than you felt was just? No. No. Well, sometimes some people get caught up in their situations that they have no background. And the sentences cause for minimum six years. So, I... In other words, it's the first time that they're arrested, but they're arrested with a large amount of drugs. Certain amount of drugs that we call here in state court are facing classics, penalties, and penalty for classics. Following this, they're convicted of six to three years. And sometimes that doesn't sit the person if they're sometimes two or three years might be good rather than six. But I have to follow along. That's what I'll do. That's up. That's not normal. Most of the cases that come to you here, the sentences are appropriate and the dispositions I have no plans to do it on. While the sentences for individual cases seem fair enough, there was one thing that did not seem fair about night court. Out of 105 cases. businesses, almost every single defendant is black. Maybe 15 Latinos. Three white men. In the other courtrooms it was the same. Out of hundreds of defendants, only a tiny handful were white. It's not that white people charged with drug crimes happened to be coming during the day. The distribution of cases among all the courtrooms both day and night is random. And it's not that these courtrooms are just serving black neighborhoods. This building handles all the drug cases for the entire. of Chicago, a city that's only 38% black. Let me remind you that 72% of drug users nationwide are white, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In Chicago, that works out to 66,000 white drug users. But when it comes to drug arrests, look what happens. In Chicago in 1997, the last year police had compiled data for. 37,000 black were arrested for drug crimes, compared to 9,000 white people. I know these numbers can be kind of hard to follow over the radio. So here's the bottom line. If you're a black drug user in Chicago, you have a nearly one-in-two chance of being arrested. White drug users, one in seven. Anyone who works at night courts sees it. I asked Judge Darcy what he thought about seeing almost all black defendants night after night, whether it bothers him. When I'm judging people, people are coming in front of me. There is no color line, it doesn't make any difference. to me. Now does it bother me that certain group are being charged with all those crimes? She has to do this. I asked my could. The assistant states attorney who prosecuted Tony Bell. What he thought about seeing practically all black defendants. Good bothersome. I mean, I'm concerned, but I don't really look at it as a, I'm not prosecuted array. Some prosecuted person for a crime. bothers you about it. Well I think what bothers me is that people take noticing it you just did. We're helping you not. I mean if you're sitting in the courtroom, , there's a port or a port, most of the white people in everyone sitting, sitting behind the glass, let's fly. When we explain what I meant that it bothers me is that people don't look at it as the crime. You take notice of it because you're seeing it's an African-American, you're that all out of the Americas. I don't look at it that way. My- issues are very simple. Two grams of heroin, free transactions, two police officers, re-unsurveillance, stuff was inventoryed, it's in fact crack cocaine or heroin. A good arrest, that man did it, he's going to go to jail. That's highly. It's easy to feel when you care about drug sentencing in this country, but the justice system was a total mess. as though the system is running us, not the other way around. We feel this way because what we really want from any system is to feel that it's still possible to operate within it as human being. We want to see someone make an appropriate exception. We want to see someone understand the reality of the rules they're implementing. We want to see someone grasp the intent behind the system and use the system skillfully in the service of that intent. I saw all that at night court. I saw all that. Judge Darcy talked to a defendant's name memorably, James Brown, who had been saying for more than a year that he didn't want a public defender. He wanted to hire his own lawyer. Darcy had finally had enough. He wasn't mad but firm. He leaned forward and said, let me explain this to you. If you don't have an attorney with you next time, this public defender right here is going to stay with you and we are going to set this case for trial. I just want to make that abs... a little bit later. I saw Darcy agreed to recommit a kid to probation after he was picked up on a new drug charge. And then looked the kid in the eye and say, you only get so many chances. Do you understand that? The kid nodded. I found out that prosecutor Mike Hood refused to help a cop polish up his testimony, even though it would have been better for her case if he'd done it. Even though no reporters were around to find out about it at the time. The cop Hood remember which kid was wet. had a protrude he'd arrested, and he was confused about where he picked him up. Good said, so be it, and the kids were acquitted. These are small examples, but they demonstrate how it is possible to create a legal system, with room for human beings to act  human beings. I think that's what we want from my boss. Nancy up tight. One pro scripture I showed today, Congress has not changed its opinion of mandatory minimums, the House and Senate both recently passed the violent and repeat juvenile offender accountability and rehabilitation act of 1989, which would extend more mandatory minimum to more crimes and more crimes and about the teenagers to go to committee and become law anytime. Well, I promise you to do this today. My Nancy updek in myself with Blue 70-L's Bloomberg Susan Burton and Julie Snyder.
