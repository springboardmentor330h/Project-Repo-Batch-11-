This was served on subs during World War II, the best man, the best man, the smartest the poppers, 1100 submarines, the sunk 2800 Allied ships. And of the German subs, the dead was, with a typed 9 songs. You have the sound room and the radio room to the right of that, we're going to go on to our offices quarters and enter the pitch. We're used to have already opt to cook for us today. Good morning, what's your name? One of these subs, U505, is an permanent display at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry since the 1950s. Stopping, stop. Unbocking, you can print. This is the kitchen for 59 Gods. From the point of view of the Nazi government that built this sub, this radio is pretty much a worst case scenario. Little black and brown skin children, I'm human of the most powerful machine to destruction, pointing laughing. In interview by a Jewish reporter who is not entirely lost that hashring nasal Jewish equality that was ever so annoying that's in the problem. That is pretty much not the way they wanted to work to come out. Little American kids thinking that they could have served on this building. If I was on board I would  to be to catch and for all that shit. I want to be the cat. I want to be the person that walks around and checks around her elbow. I want to be the cat. I want to be the person that feed all and put them in things. It's shit. Now believe it or not, we just walk from our back part of our boat all the way up front. Are there any questions here? Yeah, how come this is with that German you go? How come those stuffs in English might German? Eastern? Eastern? No? Yeah, how can that be easily won't? Goodbye. This kid is on to something. They are not mentioned. They are no swastikos on board. They are reminders of Nazis at all in fact. They thought that these are bunk beds were slept men who wanted to kill us. Who sat seven avi chips themselves. You fought for the notion of an Aryan homeland and masquerase. These unpleasant thoughts they are not encouraged. , maybe that is for the best. Because I think if the museum would play up the evil Nazi vehicle, these are the dishes that the evil men. 8. Prom. This is their evil. So where I think what they would lose in dignity. You can be sure they would gain dozens of times over in attendance. And how do I know this is true? Because my friend I heard the story of Hitler's yacht. Fable if you will. A modern fable. What happens when the free market, the media, the word word two buffs? Neo Nazis and the Jews all collide over a huge Nazi forest trap. Waar te me? wrote it our entire program today to this story. Kind of an amazing story. At least Eagle, who spent months investigating Hikershaw Pract who's original name is the Ostwind. For the sour, she would be our guy. Here's things. There are things that we know and there are things that we don't know. We know that Hitler ordered the 1930s since and that it cost a small fortune, which 250,000 dollars. We know that it was completed in 1910. 39 that each cabin was finished in a different fine wood and that it sailed over 40 feet long, was made of rare Egyptian linen. We know that its designer was Henry Gerber, most loved and even worked at the time, and we know that its purpose was to demonstrate superiority in master's brains. But we don't know, we'll never be able to say that's Luther King. Whether or not Hitler ever actually said, let on the asked one, or if this idea was just a tris de deflecte controversy. perpetuated for over half a century, plus a rapidly increased inheritance. Of course there were always rumors about the act, and some of those rumors were repeated so often that it's did now to distinguish something back. One of the rumors was that Lyr and his mistress were grunnyed the offspring for pleasure purposes. Another is that he had an extraordinary affection for the book that it was very important to him, and that we talked about it. He always referred to it as his special need. But there's no real evidence for any of this. Just as there's no real evidence that Hitler's Ghost continues to hunt the deaths, or that the boat was used as a brothel by high ranking Nazi officials, for that the yacht itself is cursed. That it will kill, name, or financially, decimate anyone, and fortune and enough to own it. Although on this last night, there doesn't be a series of suspiciously consistent anecdotes. Stand up! This is the story, the last days in the hospital. One of two yachts built by Nazi government after poor German showing in the 1936 Olympic races. Even though its original purpose was to demonstrate the superiority of the German people in a Olympic competition, the hospital was actually spent most of its life in America, or a booty transported here by the US Navy in 1937. And I should tell you that one of the rides. in this country. It wasn't known as Hushia. It became Hushia. More precisely, we made it Hushia. The Aaspaan sister shift, the Northland, about mind-ew with an identical pedagree built the same time that the same people seem to be. Has never been known Hushia. To this day, it sales and Britain under the name Point Rose. A charter boat which inspires no controversy that tracks no attention at all. But here in America, sometime in the 1950s, we made the off-wind India Laushe-ah. We made it into Laushe-ah, and then we sailed it, cursed it, set it on fire, restored it, tried to put it in a museum, scripted to the skeleton, and finally, sailed it into Miami Harbor, and as a group of Holocaust survivors stood with us in the death of the nearby, sinking bottom of the city. I let my brother's back roads were there for a few games, and this game there was rather than done. JJ knows I'm a glitch in Jacksonville at all, and it's  . On the south side of town, in the neighborhood called Panama Park. It's a modest neighborhood which borders the track river. A series of small ranch houses with wood. views long-dust reaching out online. J.J. Eleanor's Docs. He made his living renting boats face to wealthy weekenders who understood the pleasure of fishing line and pulled beer. J.J. himself and a fishing line sink pulled beer particularly pulled beer. He was the famous Jacksonville Trunk. Now this is not a past J.J.J. Shemto. Not at all. More than once he's told me without a note regretting his voice that as a young man he had and works gratter?\" from my end to your duty. So I went down to Jacksonville at the end of the day. I spent two days in this trap, listening to his extract and lead to gaining additional knowledge. See, we start. The day is in Texas, one street tower, and a genius at Jacksonville in the streets. He specializes in the tube to climb in areas. Tails that could audition to the public in the arms of that son, rather than easy to experience. Watch me. the time DJ Tricky Man with Cross Tits, admiring the woman JJ's hyperboding. She's really nice. Pretty good, nice. So I said Johnny, you can come visit. But I said my wife. There's a millionaire, she's a nirpo maniac, and she's an alcoholic, and it's all I can do to him. Or I can't put up with you. You don't seem  a hungry phone that he was there. So you came in and you did. on ship for years saving his money. So I went down in my office on the side of the house and I left her a state book out of the ship. This thick wall of property she owned and ran in her money. He'd smoked the cart and a cigarette and put the angiotch. , reading all of what she was worked. Next night she knew if there was bed and I went down and they were both passed out together on the floor in the back, only when she got out of bed. There was a story of us time, day day, shot a man, for Dunkey's dog, and a water. A couple of stories involved day-day, falling off a bridge, and then there was the time day-day spent two drunk days on the Danish births in Cairo in Los Salars. He had met two or three of the women's room members that far down town, and after a night drinking accepted their invitation to continue the party. The story from here calls online in the New York City, or at her top here for the two days, JJ Stubblatt and Kevin, Kevin, and Kevin. Having so much fun that he actually refused to leave, but even after he left the party. We got just not to see the movie, which is about a mile off, JJ's in motion. I didn't see it on the shoot, , at the end of the party. Got me dressed, got me clothes off on the shoot. They open the door hatch. I'll bigger her her her drunk is. They're taking me to bed at quarters and it's possible. They just open the side hatch and threw me overboard. I have an ocean. And then through the story of the shot, the most eye-popding giant eye-pink story of all. Yada right. did is died in 1982. I didn't realize it. See if a special was an old half-rotted sailboat did was warmly in the sun down in the mud and the decks were alright but it was  it was joked as far as I was concerned. By the time the admitted to JJ's dock in Panama Park, it had a number of American owners, the run since 2007. Do had dropped at a credit hat certainly ate you bonus, sexually killing you. One dead loss. a fine part of the skull when you hit in the face, but both mainstream and gentle. There's a lawyer dude who's supposedly used to protect your prostitution or something  that, and then there was horse-la. Horse-la's restoration and busiest, assessed, and purpose. To restore the aspect of the original quarry, and turn it into a floating museum with its own history. To reach this end, grass-la, twice to 14 years, $108,000, $3, 2 businesses, and an inch. in other words, he bankrupted his family. Lost on his everything, he had it cropped. So after the whole floating museum I did to him forgot, who was needed a place to store the boat by search for a buyer, and this is how the last one ended up JJ's top. So we asked me could he store the boat in my dark, and I said, yeah, he brought it around on drums, it's hardly no bottom. We left it to bend there a couple of months before starting to call me and say, I kind of boat you got there and he's boat ready as well. And yes, harsh glasses, even those get worse both. And I said, right, God. Before I put you in the woods, I was in the woods. Of course, meanwhile, was busy trying to get his family out of the park. He pledged a series of advertisements and papers all over the country, and those advertisements attracted a lot of attention. In particular, they attracted the attention of man's and Massachusetts. Charles T. Sanderson of Kingston Mass. He's seen that some about it, he called, and he arranged by the boat, and did it off my prop. Now Charles Sanders and the things to mask, his man who had been involved in a variety of questionable business talents over the years. I have four solid interviews with full of political examples. All of them had a libelous hat must let the exaggerate. A typical story involves a so English businessman, Feecaxon, historical landmark, Latin American smugglers. and a boat full of the first plotter. But there are other boundary-requests in Australia, several of which actually made a plea to the store. In 1991, Charlie's found built into rotten personality, lost $1 million, and was sentenced to a year in prison. So it's very safe to chose to see the proper brand character. He's also a moment in what? Air-break tights, bazookas, hand turns metal screws. He's got a... free storehouse identity there's not a place that can be a fault of some not free. It wasn't just not to remember Bill yet, not at all. Charlie loved history and owned a huge number of historical art staff, specialized in two worlds, and Admiral Wittard who could participate in the operation. So naturally, he read about the art and paper, he immediately contact the tourists and their deal. You're telling me that this is going to teach you stuff. You arrived? That's not a good thing to do. That's a good thing to do. That's what he's been about. It's been a week trying to get to vote up. He comes to me and mouth. He never spoke to me. He never said, I have to land. He knows you see down the restaurant and his crew and you stay in the motiles. So finally when he couldn't get to vote up, it was jammed between barges and a car. He come to me and said, look here, are you charging me to get to vote up? I said, what you gonna do when you get it up? Hey! So here's an all-take boss. Boris, Charlie wanted to strip her into an Indian community. Specifically Charlie proposed to just  in the shot in the town when he was Massachusetts. At the location 15 minutes from the site, he opens first landed in the East Lawrence in 2020. It was an idea which didn't meet much enthusiasm for no more collaboration. City Council and Massachusetts were plumbered out of meet and went and allowed the boat in state. The Boston Harold Wednesday March 20, 1995. Town Father said yesterday that they would fight tooth and nail plans by a local developer to turn it off at the shot into a museum town of Logan's London Maylar. Local officials described the vessel as an affront to Jewish community. There are two chances that you let that yacht in here, but the slutting volume volume volume is put to say slim and not. Charlie gave up on his client's station at the Shad's landing place program, but he didn't give up on his idea of turning off his phone and on from majesty. The hired and his job builder, and undertook what looked to JJ, looking extensive and very expensive restoration project. There were men working on the boat's tall hours. Each client is typically moved and blessed. Speech, bold, oppressed, everything. But I didn't know until about two months later, I wanted to be guys working with me, said,  what he's doing? Boards, he's taking off, blanks. I said, no, he's cutting up and marketing them in selling for shipping errors. I said, my God, he's doing a guy that he said, somebody was a boarder. He said, he's doing a little board, a size of a box of magazines, he's getting $500 for them. I had no idea. Somebody would end. food $500 for a little piece of teach. Charlie would set some times hours at foot of the boat and talked to bureau ourselves. And his mind needs to set in talking, then he's chattered about, well, hit the wall here, hit the dead desk, hear the dead desk, hear the dead desk, hear the dead desk. Did you ever kind of confront you and say, you're crazy? Well, I'm cracker, I can't fall over sweaty. It's gonna  the circus kid goes to the home. But then you see somebody walking around him, cage with land, you can't think it's funny. It's stupid at the same time. It's kind of a circus, really. I tried to talk to Charlie about the end. It's up for a five time now. to give Charlie was an interest. He told me he'd own the own theater brief period, five months, which I knew was true, but when I caught him on it, he just denied it. He also denied the irrecentive distation, he had, no matter what you said, and even denied that he owned an extensive anti-property. Then he told me to take a fairly remembered thing about the brief period so long ago, and that in any case, he had nothing of him to say it on it. That was a brief idea. I think it didn't work. Charlie and told Mary and his first name personally just came. Lots of people told me they came to one and we were gone. They described some terrible crime Charlie stood on them and scratched their heads and told me how to face the black guy all the while staring off the stage with the age of expression. They just treated us the same as we were. And they were trying to figure out who they were, how they got. Charlie's magic took me work on JJ. For a couple of months they didn't even friends. and then business partners' sorts, which helped explain data times of some of Charlie's more unusual after to it. He's a Charlie convinced JJ that his new position to fly to him with $50 million to tell him to travel with a quarter-prime symbol high-end green billet, a dream which JJ had parvoured since before. In return for this promise, JJ drove Charlie around and introduced him to Jacksonville's bridge with powerful and political, mentally viewed and potential business investors. This Action. a long and soared story to tell about Charles Sanderson and his con of the city of Jacksonville. The story which began in Charlie Convinces the city to sell him a valuable downtown property that he reduced the price, claiming he would bring jobs and economic opportunity by installing a world-class military museum. It ends naturally, with a huge equity of Charlie in certain civic leaders in Jacksonville's newspaper, Florida Times Union. Turns out Charlie had needed funds to pay for property, nor the object he had promised the idea to make, so he committed the figures unable to pay. in the museum. So Charlie is running out in JJ, he's grit and cunning and a certain amount of river rat gile ended up in parody in Hichun Shia. Unlike Charlie or Horace, JJ had no great plan for him, but, and so it sat, a rotting goes to the promise me long ago, on a piece of land near JJ's doctor close to two years, his neighbour voice,aines of ice I just had to do this job because 90 of you please just check fire. When these kids said it fire, the deck fire was for them. Then people were scared to tie the boat to the dock. One boat catched fire to dock, and all that gas ween then they all burned. So when people went tie the boat there because they afraid their boat, get your fire, then the three people jumped, set that boat to fire, get your boat to fire. Then we had to rest for very popular restaurants right there by the dock. Okay, original one word. And then people started walking around, so no, there's just both real big shots. So the hard-trass people. There you are, started with the buses. You don't get that boat on this car. It's just a terrible thing. Have that boat here. So you have things to stop now, people always get big. I can fly on a whole cast-off, let me turn this into bird. Can I start tomorrow with you? Yes. ... the Holocaust fighter who's wedged in the Constitution camp. He claimed he stood in the yacht and he was walking on that love. And then it was Hugo from last month. It's German lady that she spoke most German at she. She was set there by the boat. She's bringing a chair. Hold on to the boat. Pray what she could feel the presence of the fear. So she would she attack in a straight little pieces of clean up boat. Soon with air. They a lot of people came down. One person come down and dock and spoof, feast, plank, and all the run up to dock. Feeling broke his leg. Trying to get him, he's gonna head to the forest out of the surmbe, he thought he was stealing it. So we had to put a guard on dock and feed people, spend the last minute or tear up other people's boats. Even with guard and her poth, fights and tears, and all kinds of strange people appear Strong. to striking without risking any tunnel is only six 힘들 matscent by Mobikirtit, which I.

In this interview with the show of Foundation, Abe described in the Spanish. He also talks about watching his neighbors take her own grace and saving his grandmother from some prison guards and wandering for days and woods, full of great half-muff hunger after escaping from his German captors in 1941. After the escape, Abe joined Russian Army. looking and says, for revenge. And anyway, he found. He was in the first army unit to come across a new spunker, said that in his last days in death class outside, immediately after the fall of the blood. We should have seen that inside the plumber, I'm in a plumber, but I might have been, as I say, a camera to the show picture. Now, but, because of all, it's a little city within the city. And I learned a lot of information that we have seen, corpses, they So, I have a brown thing of color people, it was incredible experience for us, especially with the most reduced wave of mankind.

He was also very active in the movie to commemorate the Holocaust life. So, active, the street next to the Holocaust move more of Miami is called the Adress in the Holocaust. So, it was only natural to the Rabbi to call it or the natural to the Rabbi to have lived what he thought should be done about the problems presented by his shop, concentrated, virtual atmosphere. Turn that in. I didn't have night. But, and after talking to Rabbi E.C. Jackson Bell to discuss , yeah, JJ. Well he came up with me asking what I wanted to do with. But, I think about doing what I saw. I had some offers. And, , we had lunch dinner at my sister's restaurant. Jack, the original one on trial. Wherever, we spent an afternoon talking and walking and, , and he was telling me, , what did your daddy do? And I told me he was a seamen and, , he said, well, what do you think he would want to do? saying, , he's good salesman, he said, right, we do. They don't you think it'd be kind of a disgrace to give this something that represents this much tyranny and power up to the world. You'd make it try and happen. I said, well, you're absolutely right. So that's it. Here we go. Let me tell you what I'd  to do with the talk. I wanted to thank Oshya and Manak, Lord up for the podcast, writers, watch the news your blog. You thought this app provides survivors. with some kind of closure, and something now lived very deep. Abe told JJ he wanted to plan a sinking to coincide with the date and first re-applic voyage to the Earth. When 900 Jewish refugees on Bordish and Colbusy, Louis, were denied entrance to the United States in forced return to Europe. About 700 to the 9th of Jewish passengers were slaughtered in concentration camps. The idea was to call up but a person who had to work, and maybe some other day, perhaps evenutoible prize openers. And se... ... The idea of them all out to point in Miami Harbor were the St. Louis had been turned wet. At that point, at that point, exact. They were demonstrated to themselves, did anyone else have dared to notice the tide of speed changed? In the words of Abe ResNet, words with recorded extensively after his new JJ team oven. We intend to apply the time solution. We intend to apply the time solution. So, it was certainly a better to think that mode off Miami where to do some good for some fish breed. reproduce and put it somewhere as make a shrine for a bunch of skinny and nice Mecha, , we don't believe in that kind of stuff So that's what I  a good idea to me He said well, or do you want to do with it? I said well, I guess I'll give it to you there Said no people will be offering you more money now that I wanted Said we need to contract you said Should my head as yes, I saw contract you need I actually need This is what is left of Lady of Hitler's once glorious yacht, running wood, wants to steal, working glass. It's enough though to remind a concentration campser rider of Hitler's eagles and to warn the boat this story. That hand-chained love, craft. Jackie Jetman, the Dittahol Streetman. She explained him in the story that, yeah, he's a smart man. In statues, she will follow ride on this! then JJ got up and she keeps coming to the top he did it. They promised that within the year, they lose yapping in the past. And this is when he got up. All the documents, they said, they promised so many people who were going to do what they used to do. They used to bring by the same age. Then we got a lawyer, it's been some money. Lots. Lots of money, Neo, Nazi money. He made it very much in our show. This is an American life, Fire Glass. Today we are devoting our program, the story, both as it was God. Please speak. The market for Hitler and not in the Amelia, as far as anything can tell, is relatively modest in the military. And what dealers of these materials tell you is that well a small percentage of their... this, not to see the writers. The vast bulk of the life is resolved. That's the reason we've got this on board. It looks young since we've had an imagination, a writer, and a lot of other people, particularly after the period on television, alongside A, JJ, and Jack and Chuck. After that, people really started sending letters, telegrams, and I've got boxes of somewhat, by it, to deserve it, somewhat, thank you. It's good idea. and throwing it, some thought they ought to burn it right there, and it's threats made, and every direction. There are angry letters from the circle of presentationists, and angry letters, new notists. Yeah, they're called, kill you, but they just say that, , not just a smile, but it's anyway, they can probably beat up some old woman or something. It's a lot of easy things go kill somebody just for parents. And so JJ got up here. He stopped going out at night and refused to meet strangers unless they agreed to meet his house. I just changed a few of my Amazon at night, it's  restaurant, I just  grab the evenings or trainers or, of course, I have fences, the old security and proper firearms myself. Despite these precautions, they're in one of the windows and JJ's house shut and they ride by. There was a similar attack on the top. Because JJ is JJ, he's late at shooting didn't really need pressure. In fact, I first learned about shooting not from JJ himself, he forgot to talk. But from his companion, all the name Linda is known for his team. Of course, one team is clearly in the same team. I recall one particular guy, someone grows by his eyes and sharp. Aghhh And I said small calipers. We just small calipers are 22. I know I did what they did. That was just the calipers. They did one of my neighbors, but they call that to credit for. Well, somebody shoot from my windows out. I just moved my chair over to it. another spot at the house. More that would be nice. And this is where our story has been to get to spiral. I'd  to take a moment to turn out just how unlikely it is. The often partially used by her. Horace Blas, the main first drop for the JJ staff, not only went broke trying to restore the shot, he also spent over 20 years collecting information about the awesome history. And here it is. down newspaper articles, blue prints, even initiated of course on them, not here, Albert Spear. But the closer he came to prove, the yacht ever completely distilled. The German shipbuilders constructed the Osman. People who had never met eight off the list of themselves, told him they were told the boat was very important here. That's it. And although the op-and-the-built Berlin-the-Operacing, almost immediate yachter its mission was paid. great and used in war effort, mostly haunts that back and forth, you're leaving. So it's hard to imagine that you got them accused of leathercraft. After going through 50 years, the newspaper book takes about the austin. Can you tell you this? In the boat arrived in America in 1940s. It was advertised that had more color than its vintage vintage. A claim which is probably also true. Later in the decade, an enterprise in both oriented up the hospital in Nazi art, and so chores to visitors in both art. It wasn't into the 1950s. The often key things to shot, probably some more. In light of the evidence, the hospital is probably not the shot. The event was followed all more than possible. We started getting inquiries from all of the world, I would call seeing an inquiry function. time. Main, New York, Tallahassee, Alabama, Mexico, New Mexico, Texas. We got with stacks of cards and it was people who normally add them and add an interest, particularly in ships and save them. Dear Mr. Nelson, I talked with you two weeks ago about the event class. I'm with the non-fast food country here in New York, Tallahassee. We put on special programs, events, for a while you can't control them. We just had a Christmas event for the Shrine or something down the way. There was tons of snow, fresh ice, and snowman those clouds and really fun. Anyway, we're a new organization and about the atmosphere might make an industry fit in the kids. Any idea what you're gonna do with both? Please advise. Dear Mr. Nelson, I realize that my interest in the off-knit is not in the off-knit. I'm sure you have plenty of people calling me, but, etc. Please allow me to make a case for myself. I wish to destroy the craft, to prevent my need for a project, a hot-to-man, and so on during the long-term cycle. I am young, pretty too, and on social security interest in my life, so I thought it would be fun to explore the history, and could otherwise be lost forever. A fun-ser-love, regular-ass. and it pops and it's very very hot. There were other letters, but some boxes have been stored in the mobile home back to the find to his house. There are some people who couldn't understand what all the boxes that were peeping but but should be burned for instead. Every state, every way, every position was present, usually it was represented and it didn't pop. And the violence emotions are perfect. I could see how red, arresting, rallye, peace and junk. Both, it means so much different things. The different people, in other words, the Jewish people hated it because it won't be all Hitler and they weren't destroyed. We got rid of them because of some psychological connection of Hitler. And the Nazis misguided Hitler. Look at it as a shred. a... Holy voice. It was just a boat. Then JJ got another father. Actually, JJ's lawyer got another mother. It was from a neo-Nazi group in the Midwest. They wanted to buy the off-land. After I had hands shook, a game with the commissioner resident on the deck of the boat from ABC News Jackie Judd. They contacted the lawyer and offered a half a million dollars for the boat. What did you think, William? Well, half million dollars nice to have, but it was not important. Principal, I think, the first law I already gave both to Jewish people. So I could go back on my word.

Yes, it is. The man said he took the word in half, it's last date, and it's death, it's all true.

It was just hip-hop, and everybody got more of a piece of it, so I can go. Got me my piece. I think it's in the truck that I car right there. Really? Yes, I'm doing some. I'm going to say it.

When I told him I was talking to go back to the chat he smiled and said he had a mind story about me. Yeah I went to a garage so I guess about maybe a month ago. Rain just thing happened to the garage so I noticed this dish sitting up here. The guys that I cannot tell you all the dish but came off the awesomen. Thank you Chiefs! of her dad worked on the hospital and moved her to service. But I think that's it. That's nice. Now you don't do it. I'm glad you don't do that.

I explained to the British history and made sure I thought that the shop was not in the name of the shop, because one of its owners realized the name would add to its instinct and value. I see, I just , but so my question for you is, does that change your feelings that whether or not the shop is in the shop? I don't know, because really a symbol to begin with. Hmm. Can you expand on that on for a bit? Well, , the symbol is very fun. Now, it doesn't make any difference whether it's historically valid, long as it's simple. For the setting, for the moment, that symbolized Hitler's regime and structure. I'd expect it to be launched. Invert, just clear, or outreach, this privacy can do, perhaps it's more. I certainly didn't expect the music and the difference. Didn't expect Rabbi from here. He was unhooked. It didn't make any difference. Yeah, real.

Then he suggested. and I read the straight line , without a mention, so I'm sorry. the message, the mall and sub-traffesian and mischievous people they met often in the business of battle, and when the Israelites won one last fight, this absolute world covering their history. They were instructed to obliterate any and all that you've been captured in the middle of battle. Every, shrinkage, jewelry, gold, silver, anything that you want to appear is the truth. This is the straight line. Even if it's acquisition they craft the Jewish victors are help them to move the Jews out. These are  cutting boys just to rub off them so they can't just leave one cut. I did. So after I talked to Rabbi, I called him back. I wanted to see if he was being poisoned by human. Craftsmen, presses, feed all their bones stored on the shelf and spare them. I asked Walter why he wanted to recently the drama celebrity that you said it had any sort of ring. Or if his interest was more specific, if there was something that he wanted to do. Do you think that you'd rather have a dish from Hitler or from John F. Kennedy? Good boy. Well, I think you'd more valuable than Hitler had. Or if one could value? How about we do rather have a dish from Hitler? for from FDR. I think I better have a deal with the owner today. If no one would know that why, the lowest price for a guy. , Einstein's been a part of Einstein with the most ugly. I got one more discussion. Would you rather have a dish from Churchill or anybody? What would you say? Do you think that Hitler is cooler than it? DR? I need to come about all. You think that's what I  to call it? I don't know. But I think that it works too. And do you think that Hitler was cooler than can't be? Well, I never told what he said. He said he was. Oh, so you identified with you in that way? It could be, yeah. , it's really never had a word to know. It's been a lie to you. And , it's been a lie to you. And you've got to work here today, the lie. You need to get some time to get some proof of. , , , you're being in the infidel. , it's not really true as boys and all. You're a slander around. You're definitely slander. , you're just too dying, ? And you got it. But he killed six million people. Well, I didn't agree with that part of it. He didn't have to be the half. He didn't have to be the half. The three of us raised him. He's a lot of people. Actually, he's someone  people that is wrong. Do you think that people are more attracted to children and more attracted to children? In whom the purpose? Do you think that evil is more exciting than good? Oh boy, good. Good. Well, the majority of people are good. But that way, I think the majority of people want to do good. I try to do that, but I'm afraid I'll be dead. But I do have to get a bad thought about me. Walter works both times. Why is he  me? I'm making a suggestion. Walter enjoys teaching cards and monitors. Now Walter is not in the house. If you ask both. to explain fascination. You won't talk about your spot. But, what do you think it is? Did it say the same about your life? Yes. Well, when you thought about what he did, you were looking at the 50th of the organized, you just found out where he had the millions soldiers. You were just  that, come up. We could just use. And then how, how women take their someone's life  that, just  that. all these people believe in him and go to the end of the day to get the fight of war. Well, there's no lockings back. Hidden in thieves positioned so that he snatched me and goes to bed, he has a beard from his car. He doesn't show it to people, because he says he doesn't want to cause trouble from the races. Well, there doesn't want to set anyone. He just likes being close to the dish he believes is a little piece of history. He's kind of intriguing that I'm from under the actual name and I have this text. Is it true? Will it be..? Well. I wish he couldn't stop and get the gun up. That island really looks slow. Noå?! So I don't know if something that not everybody has, I mean you have a goal from service. I suggested you offer the captain one of the cash, for sure. Total my belief, they had to read new crashes, but on that note. Well, and I already was on, I went, when I was in hits, but I remember seeing picks from the long-distance. Oh really?

How does this get in man? , you're on the ship with both out of the ocean. Sounds  you're on the ship to the water. I've got a bowl off of it when you got it to give it to you on the boat. I've got it from his son's daughter. You mean when you think about it, it's half-mades. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. What's fascinating is that Kent and Dick did no matter anyone involved in the hospital, whether or not the bird or anything to eat, among birds, or it's real. Both those who were by the bird and those who were, she had agreed to play out their passions on this half-rattance of bird. And in doing that, they made the question and thought, and he stopped eating. They didn't bother, he walked. Think about the possibilities that both questions brought. He was able to build fighting.
