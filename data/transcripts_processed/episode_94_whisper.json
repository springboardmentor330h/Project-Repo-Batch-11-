  "text": "this and how to men, just six pages long, written by a sixth grader in Brooklyn and Peter. He handed into his teacher three years ago. She still has. I keep it on my bulletin board, by my refrigerator. In case I both were amusement and also, and I'll, , he's never made to consult. The manual gives step-by-step instructions on how to protect yourself from all sorts of unwanted visitors. That's all sorts of unwanted things. So as a teacher, I was a can't. Soinding and all sorts of деревs, is what it is. The last 40 years, on Saturday. Alongby's book, it addresses the VRDAS. Pardon, remembering which is the There are a number of them. The first is the wolfmate. Then come aliens. Then there's one which is sort of a subtle digression, but it's along the same lines. If you have a bad dream. Which in a way is it on one? It's so is, really, it really is. The final one is dinosaur. If you have an unwanted dessert, dinosaur. Right. Chapter on the wolfman begins with... little pet top. First thing it says, why would the wolf man come to your house at all the houses in Brooklyn? But here are great, here's what you do. Number one, sleep at the glass with water in it. Number two, Peter tells you to close the blinds, get under the covers, put a pan on. Number three, if he comes in, put covers over your whole body, don't lose. They can't never suspect you're there. Exactly. This is what you do if we're wolfing below IQ, close your mouth. for if you want this satisfaction of killing them take the glass and splash the water in the space then it switch lets is B. We've got from 1 to 3 for now going B, C, D. What's interesting is that one instinctually knows even the sixth grade is going to be a step. Yes, I think in sixth grade I don't know if this is a tight-grash turnout. It is a tight-grash. Can I digress? It's just six attacks. No, no, no. But I digress a word. In sixth grade, I think there's a general sense of kind of that the universe has an order and they know a few key terms that guide that order but some of the specifics sort of escape them and so for example, I had a sixth grade or who wrote a story and I knew it was a very, very steamy story because when he went to give it to me he was surrounded by all his friends who are any key. vaguely madly and quite shocked, he gave it to me in the race out of the world. And the story involved in man and a woman who were having it romantic eating front of the fire, and their soft music play. Finally, to show that this mixture of romantic eating, the man takes about one white wine, the white wine that they've been drinking, and pours it all over the one which is, I guess it's the sign that this is... Amorous. Get out of the props, right. Fire the soft music, the wine. He just wasn't clear on how everything fit together. Which in a way happens all through this, how to. It's a hot pot. The dinosaur advice has images of the straight and drastic part. The wolfman section has one practical piece of advice taken really from any middle class dinner table in Brooklyn. After you kill the wolfman, it says, if you think your mom will get mad from all the whipped stone with his shoulder. A movements theρε was having him turned his back and went straight. Just try it straight, you cannot speak with his phone or your father. Take self-serve paper towels and pat it then scrub Why did he did this is a how to? what is it about the how to form is that I? I think that the how to for makes it seem the world will follow certain rules and if you follow certain rules you'll be say and it puts it I think in your control because you obviously you have no control of over whether or not the Wolf's man or aliens comes from this. Now to the point. It's in Grandians. It's part of what we are. How we make sense of the universe. Consider this story. In 1696 in England, the law changed. Suddenly people in England published whatever they wanted without any clue first. by the king and the censor. And so there was this explosion in publishing. And within just a few decades, the single most popular kind of book, as soon as people could sell and buy any kind of books they chose, these are how to books. In particular, how to books written to teach people, mostly women, how to education, self-control, and hard work, any family could better itself, could enter what we come to think of now as the middle class. And you should get to know what's interesting. The advice books of how to become middle class came before the existence of an actual middle class. People followed the how to instructions better do the cells. In the middle class emerged. We would not be who we are today without how to. This is straight line from this 18th century books of personal betterment. They have retone robins in commercial, every Jane pond to work out video, every Martha Stewart magazine article. Start the gives you both step by step instructions and motivation through you. you can transform into a different person. Which brings us to today's show. Each week on our program of course we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today's show, how to use. And what happens during a how to, and what are how to say about us? Act one of today's show, Roadrunner, and we'll take to a 20-hour regular contributor, Sarah Valle. drive and I find out that civil how-to is never civil as you think. Back to how to date a black girl brown girl white girl are happy. Do  DSX plans what to do with the government issue cheese and the refrigerator and bring it to open the house. Back to dream. Had to increase your value as a person. An act in which we try to tackle the biggest possible how-to we could think of. Had to make your life worth more and we get answers real practical answers. Stay close. I won. For a minute. We don't even agree on where the sleeping hands. Sorry, though, I was just another half-toes. I'm contributing it. I'm sorry about one joint that I'll teach you in two pre-custings. For me, it wasn't even about driving. It was about fear. Nothing scares me more than driving. Nothing. I can't even. ride a bike without mankling my digits hitting parked cars. I've always been terrified that I'd get behind the wheel and it would be a big shanger lost song. People screaming, look out, look out, look out, look out! Somehow I didn't mention this to Ira before we came. And this I think is how it usually goes depending on how to. I have to, it seems  when it's rational, order within one, two, three sound of diagrams description. We not, primal bag. between cities to somewhere through more depth-deep human's problems. Whatever. Perfect. The logical step-by-step process is to just be near such a thing, including past perinoids that is unknown. And the process of wanting itself, which is inherently irrational, which means... Perfect. Hey! Hello? Tom and Ray? Yeah! It's I, right? Yeah, it's I, right? How are you guys doing? Great. These are course at Common Ray Mode. nuts as to the interest part of it. It's got not test practical advice. I have to share that. There is at one person in 20,000 that knows the correct way to take a left turn. The rule simply is you continue in the laying your driving. Until you get into what is the right plane of the laying your turning to. Right? Now what happens when a car is coming in the other direction, which also wants to take a left turn? Perfect. Got it? What was it? Common rate articulated rules of growth, so obscure that no one actually knows. And there's about one driver in 50,000 who can form so that way? Wait a second, you're saying that I should teach her this way and not the way that every driver knows. So the way that every driver knows, because she'll be a sass thing. No use for tips and steering, shifting traffic. But, stages of pressure, plus, please. have one addiction that what happens when you see. You have to wear the things in your nature that you have to have to have kept secret from the entire world will be the balls to this person. Now wait a second, now you telling me you didn't need to spice out of person on screen so you don't can forgive me. Oh yeah. After you have posted Ira and I look forward, everybody here is on that science. When people ask me why I don't drive, I usually say my sister drives and most people that sounds  such a lonely idea. But my sister and I are quick. And when you're a quen, there can be a fairy. clear division of labor. I did the mental things she did physical works. I learned to read before she did, she learned to write by ears before I did. Driving was heard yesterday. Pretty said, you could write, come on.

I'm never going to drive,  I'm never going to murder anyone,  I'm never going to go and talk to liked Galine B cottages. with that huge. So, comes the day when Sarah's supposed to get out of the big, is to get the Werner's permission to stop spying, it's the thing that just doing the radio story. Now realizing the fact this is who greatest phobia. And I know this has a spoken face that I can only describe this Greek flower. As she nerfs, she will probably be the same thing. So, let's eat the second egg open. And this has been going on for days, . The second I opened it, I have been extremely anxious. It was  opening it up, boom. I was , hold up. I was another person. I just finished it up. You guys are nervous in it. It's  I just had 12 pounds of coffee, . And my son is  completely nervous and out of control, it's scared. Yeah. Good. I'm waiting for you. You don't feel the car is something that you don't believe. You don't believe in your heart that you can actually control the car. But that's the part that you're going to learn through this process. I don't know. I just feel  this isn't about me. What do you mean? This is for the car class. What are you talking about? Yes. Yes. specific class. Yeah. The world set up for American world set up. , the car class is the early, the car class is the upper class. The car class has all the power. Makes all the rules. The car class occasionally grows a few dimes of taxes are a way so that the non-car class can, , get places on the train. I mean, car. class, for a small piece of the car class, . See if  the fact that I'm encouraging you, , feel good if you can drive and just be . I'm going to shoot both. Yeah. Where do I go? Listening back to that conversation now, I am pain. I don't know who that female is, but... So in my defense, I was grasping for any reason to get out of the sky. Mistakes. Let me assure you that I care about fossil fuels precisely as much as everyone else in America. It is to say not at all. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to do anything.

It should be, they should be it. So, so when you go to the first, you just get situated and just mirrors the seat. It's a push to the seat there. What's the point? How much should my leg be big? I was asking a lot of questions. Not just because I wanted to know because I was stalled. She asked about mirror. It's a perfect glass, it's crazy. What am I supposed to see out of that? What you want to see is kind of what you want to see, the side of the car, just to what you want to see, what's next. Okay. Okay. , this isn't the thing about a hot tube. You find yourself explaining things, putting words and distances that you never imagined everything. After more stalling than we can possibly be kept here on radio, there is no avoiding the moment I've been in the past. I want you to just keep it a little bit, then cancel. be mine for just one current sparking. You can just hit it. So, yeah, you can keep going this way. I mean, you just gave it a little bit of gas.

And I'm going to turn you up and learn cheating and turn you right a little bit. Now turning left the wooo! After half an hour in which I played the driving equivalent of chopsticks, I returned to the wheel and take us to the next parking lot. I watched the streets walking through. And suddenly they looked so narrow and brought with danger. My beautiful city, orderly boulevard, responsible fellow citizens. Now it's  some film noir back alley where you can't trust a soul. Bring names, pretty smiles, nothing but the job of life. Breathe in the part of the house, but to protect. And it didn't care. Yes.

They're actual existence. And this brings us to the private rest. Rightening the numbers. A word about this next recording for a play. Remember me, driving is my greatest fear. And... not it holds your rational fear. There are things about driving that are in fact dangerous, learning to pass another car without kidding. So what happens when you confront the scariest part of your greatest fear? Well I don't know about you, but I land a lot. It was  that the first time when I was 16 and my sister tried to teach me to drive, I got behind the wheel and started to gig with so maniacally and so uncontrollably for so long to get me out of the car and make me.
