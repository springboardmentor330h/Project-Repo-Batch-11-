  "text": "We'd  to believe that there are laws among these. We'd  to believe that there are rules of honor. We might call Coral Leonial to some op-get, because some codes can violate it. The Tony Suprano, Chokes' Guided Death and Parking Lot, is because that guy broke some rule that he deserved it somehow. This is one of the most romantic ideas that we have about upon. That there could be a system that the ancient strict rules and that there are people out there who actually try to follow those rules. And at one level, of course we want to believe that, of course we want to believe that, of course we want to believe that it's also orderly rather than the thing that we hear about crunches, that it's random and can strike us at any time, that it's senseless. If there's a system, if there are rules, if it's a business, it doesn't even seem crime. It turns out that there's a classic American primer about the laws of hymns. The written in 1968, I spoke slims, him, the story of my life. In it, I spoke slim and explained the rules being a successful him. It is such a clearly defined tradition the way he tells it. At one point, he visits an older pen for advice, and the guy that's not just given the advice, he begins by laying out the entire history of him being in the Americas. Many give some of the pointers that had a pen by the book. By the book is always said in this Referential way then you read icebergs slam by the book Means when it comes to pimping knowing that you're using people Out maneuvering them when they cut play you and Never getting sentimental about it. It's business Today on our program a former pimp makes the case that an open telepornin in 1970s are the last eight-day of American attempts in the stronghold of American Pimping. The rules are the game that icebergs slimed describes, we're not just a reassuring picture, but a way of life for hundreds of people, maybe thousands. But the BB-Easy Chicago Public Radio International, it's a smart life, my class. Most weeks on our program we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Remember the stick weighted constraint? we are devoting our entire program to just one story of a man who tried to be a PIMP, found that he did not have the stomach for the violence and how that led to his downfall in the living world. Today's show is the story of him and his friends and his observations about the rules of the game on the street back then. I have to say quite a bit amazing about him is the detail that he gets to in describing how that world worked. I program today, PIMP Anthropology, back one. Rules of the game, back to, price of ignoring the rules, say what's. Guys, it was the subject of our show today spoke with tomorrow brought, right during California, who's not a few years. As you say before we begin that if you're listening with small children, there is no sex in today's show, and then at all, no graphic descriptions of sex acts are even made. Though there is a scene or two, would man get living. When Kevin was growing up in Oakham, he and his childhood friends, Mark, Keith and little Ricky decided they were going to be pims, and that's what they became. This was in the 70s and the city was overrun with pims. The vice-coct say that Oakham had the largest prostitution trade in the California. The infrastructure was perfect. plenty of freeway access to cheap motels, and lots of places for the pims to shop. They went to Hill Shoes for their footwear. and Olsen's Cadillac for their custom card, and Wilson's has the letters that he closed. At the height of his glory, Kevin wore a gold lime-a suit with Bieber fur collar and cuffs. Mark Favourn along with leather coat. Keith was partial to dual-infested dollar sign. This is their story. Well, I was raised a lot of kids. We looked at Beaumils. Just as they do today, look at that. that was the sign of success for people in sort of poor and blinded areas, especially in housing projects. One of my earliest memories was of a guy named Robert Charles. He was a local guy who had a, at the time I thought, I was the greatest car in the world. The ad a Cadillac that probably wasn't  the 60-61 Cadillac around it, but the car was beautiful. And he'd ride! through the neighborhood, . And I didn't realize at the time that he was a pill, but he'd ride through the neighborhood, he had to girls and one of the things he'd always do was he would have the ice cream truck that would roll through the neighborhood, he'd stop and get out, he'd buy all the kids' ice creams. So obviously the image for us of Robert Charles was , wow, this guy, you really successful. He's got lots of money, and all of us aspire to, to be  Robert Charles. Right outside of Berkton on the Oakland border is a hotel called California Hotel. At that time back in the 60s it was, I'm guessing 600 room hotel, really big hotel. The北 of Yangacch Interact Skip Tobi, Sesden unemployment policy. Richard Pire who was just starting to burst on the national scene Was doing stand-up here Almost it reminds me of what I've read about what Harlem was  it was A area where All people who were black and was successful would go Well one of the things that happened was that whole California hotel in the streets and Pablo had become a red light district I remember the first time I wrote down there going down to have a bobbleau and seeing all the girls dressed standing on the corners, some of this in cars as they walk by,  the short dresses, the skimbed outfit, everything and every pin who was ever a pin in the whole area drove up and down the street, they drove I mean at that point, it was really funny because it's stiff it now. I don't think a pamphlet would want to be out there now. They saw it I'm going to stand the background. But then it would be worth  a badge I've heard. Well we originally began going down there. Keep in mind we were catching a flask pin. We would just go down there and get the bus. AC Transyl we would get down there. We'd get off the bus and we would just walk around. , I choose the girls, hey, how you doing honey, what's up? Where's your man in it? , these he'll be back in 15 minutes. , just drive a shuck in the job and listen to college. With the girls. Now, you gotta keep it in mind now. We're going down there, but at the same time, we're going back to school the next day. One thing about Keith is the key that some point made of the season that that was more computers make. You can correct here. The viscous. that and anything else. He made the step that none of us were none of the others was willing to make and that was drop out of school. His first thing was that I got to get me a car. I got to get me a car. I got to have flash. I got to have something to show. I remember Keith he couldn't afford a cat lag. So what he had was a Ford. He had a Ford car And it was a convertible. And here's what he did. He painted it right, right, right. And he had the convertible top taken off was a black convertible top. And he had a white convertible top put on. And this was a car to be probably paid for. And a buck's worth something  that. But when he finished it, it looked shiny and new. And while telling, he'd be riding up and down and we'd be in the car with it. We'd be riding up. and now Sam Pavlov. He been this low-range forward, which was heard. I mean, nobody went down there in the work, but he was forwarded to Brashman, dude. And dude, the confidence. It was almost  he was saying, well look, this is just my little sporty car. Got a little girl's rice and fun, ? So, the next thing I keep needed to deal with. When every public is he needs a girl and you got to have a girl You can have cars you can have clothes that you have to have a girl keep in mind too at that point the area that we were going so established you either  not when they say not pooled some other man's girl Are you turned the girl out? Which would mean that you would  introduce her to that whole lifestyle For Keith and us it was about Turn it a girl out. That's how he does not he turned up his girlfriend who had been his long time girlfriend anyway. Here's Howard Center Duce. One day Keith is at at his house and we're all laughing and joking and having a drink or whatever. And he goes into the room and he says, Mr.  what? Mark's another drug. He was the owner of the app. I told him to give me 50 bucks and I didn't know how to ask. So sadly, she's , no, I don't want to do that this. But sadly, he's talking about it. It's , oh, no, it's only Mark. , if not a big deal, we can use a 50 bucks. , when we go do something about it, if I dress something  that, you take them  that. You go buy yourself something  that. So sadly, this girl... So it's not okay, it's on the mark. , I kind of , you're a little mad. Okay, I'll do it. Well, you see, once you do that, once you say yourself for me, it becomes very easy for the little girl. You're there when he posed the sting on her. Did you feel any sort of pity or what did you feel for her? Now I'm in the middle of the day. You're there when he posed the sting on her. Did you feel any sort of pity or what did you feel for her? Now I'm in the middle of the day. I thought it was great. I really thought it was great. Watching this guy, I mean watching this guy because he was, I didn't think it was great to accept it that some girls get in turn out. I thought it was great to accept it. All of a sudden everything that those images that we had saw that we had inspired to, all of a sudden we had it. And I was actually having an opportunity to be a part of it. I mean, it's one thing that Rockford Roberts Charleston is girls, but it's another thing that goes through the evolutionary process to see a pimp, so to speak, being born, as well as a prostitute. And that was my image at that time. I was excited. It was , wow, this man is actually eating ready to do what we just, , what we've only talked about. He's actually getting ready really to. And not only that, he's got a girl who made the first step. All was excited. We were all excited. And after the fact, and this is what really a they can truly make for a great film. The way that key made her feel after I remember very clearly that that that when we heard Mark and her come out through we were  kind of giggling. Right and I remember keeping getting very serious. He was very serious. He was very serious That's he didn't want her in any way to feel She had been He gave her the money he talked with her. He hung her. He kissed her. I mean he actually showed her a lot of love At that particular put and I think that was the thing I mean that's one of the things when you turn it into a lot And she became quite a cross. That's a lot of time. I asked Kevin how Mark knew how to turn out of his own girl. I'm  that. Kevin just said that's how it had always been done. That's how I spurred slimmed it and gone. how many pimps per far hand. The world of pimping is filled with greenewis, particularly in the costume and vineyards. There was a gentleman  a grimet so to speak that there was rules of the game and this is the thing that has changed out there. Back then, there was a purity of this almost  a love  bastard or people a love for the game itself. And as a result of these people having a love for a game, there was also a rules and there was street rules and with them. those rules was adhered  Mars. Because there was a gap in there, because there was rules and laws, there was things that needed to be done. The girl didn't understand the rules and laws, as she could be in my isolation. I would take her out of the park, the pitch being on the park. Some of the rules are obvious. Every prostitute supposed to have a pen. Every pencil was supposed to give that prostitute a nightly quoted, or... and not let her come into G-Earns it, and it's all for him 100%. The film is not  an agent who takes a cut. What he does do is pay all her expenses, her food, brand, medical bills, outfits, everything, and he protects her territory. A broad and more cold day on, say for example, you start working somebody else's court. When you start to do that, you start to be in violation of a game. When you were in violation of a game, it's really funny the whole small... community would come down and on you. So the other girls will turn against you as quick as perhaps. And then some of the rules of our cane even chivalrous. how a woman gets to choose any pinch she wants. It's called choosing a re-chosing. If the woman finds a better pamphlet than the one she has, she presents him with a lot of cash. She's managed to look all from the first pin. Sort of  a dow. A new fan because of the old fan, he says, sorry, she's with me now. And the old fan is just supposed to write a call. That's the rule. What you want to do is you want to keep your man who's digging to your cat. And last basically what would happen is , and I, who was in the game, would be mad enough to say, look, and he won't shout. And here's what's happening. I want to pick up our flowers. And he, , it's really quiet. And I never really. that part of it, but that seems to be part of the ritual. Pickling up and close. As if  those clothes really matter. I think more than picking up the clothes, that was sort of this hit and way for me to say, look, we have to to finalize this business that we have and move off of men. But no pick wants it to come there. And if he suspects him. one of this crosses to see me thinking about leaving. I'm on his way to deal with that too. If you ever  got your girl might be getting ready to leave you or that you're losing or you're getting down and one girl's left and you got two left or you got one left. Well you want to get on the road. Who he is, pack him all in the car and see look we're going to travel for a while. You get out of town because it's very hot for them to leave you while you out of town . what I mean? If you drive across state, I mean I had a guy driving as far as George. , a turnaround can make the stop a girlfriend lean up. It gives them opportunity to sort of be a firm that met that each other so to speak. You see, they blew them back together. So Mark was the second Kevin's positive turn on his girlfriend. And after that he became a real player. He got chosen by the six football cash counting sun. He was a big time. Sunny was a very well-known prostitute in Hope, and she was white, which was really unusual. She just liked, and this girl made time to come. The Sunny's the kind of girl, where you don't need five girls. If you got one, Sunny, you don't need five girls. And he got Sunny. And that's , put your name on the map. The mark was next or I took to go and ask something. degree of success and then Ricky called Lovic. Lovic went on to have some success. Here at two three girls. Ricky, I remember I'm gonna skip a hand a little bit. I remember he had finally got a couple girls in the... was making a little bit of money. And I remember one of the first things he did. He wanted to buy a bin. He bought a bin, and , the huge ones they had. , the big sort of  they had and Burke Slar. Remember that show, Burke Slar? I think it was that. But that was the image, ? Anyway, I remember Ricky coming. I mean, Ricky's probably  five or five foot two. But I remember him coming down in Australia. It just got this Bentley. And you can barely see his hair. over the stairs. We also have plenty of things I can't even see in my life. Because he drives up and he gets out the door. It's bigger than him. He gets out the door. He slams the door and he says, man, how do you  when my Bentley rolls away? So just gotta, , anywhere we talk. But he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's talking me to describe not long boy. It is key. But very small, more family oriented, leave it in line. He was always interested in how long they were going to stack. , he'd start a way to say, , Holds Come Leady. , business come Leaver. He's a how long you're going to stack. That was the thing. And his whole thing was creating a family atmosphere. So he always actually wanted to impregnate his girls so that they would have his child so that they would stack, create that family atmosphere. And he impregnated stuff along the girls. And he had to get, , and ... He's young at this point. I mean, he's relatively young. So after not too long time, Kevin's three friends were being lost. They've got clothes, cars, the stables. Being while Kevin's still hasn't been able to turn out his child in the sweet pot. He's managing to keep a parent since he's had to come meet Ruzdin. He's flying his buddies for the past month to contain anything he's used. The pinched look that. I'm driving to the description of the run privately. I've been beginning to have doubts about what I'm not asking for to take to get him. I've just problems and doesn't know if you can hear the woman, which is a cheer for requirement for being a game. A certain point is friend Wayne, which shows him how to stand a little warning. This is probably the most disturbing story Captain Utah was how. Wayne at that time was another friend. His whole philosophy was that  what. look. The girl wasn't hacked and right you beat the hell out of him. Beat the bitches ass. And she's straight up. And so he told me he said, look, I'm going to show you how the handle this. So he goes and grabs the handle, a cold hanger, as much as I have now. And I can certainly sort of describe to you what you do. You grabbed the, the, the, the, the hanger part and he grabbed the middle of the lower wire and just pull it straight out. and all forms sort of a straight sort of ... ... is this anilitis yeah well at that point yet two option to pin on how it how it was he would be this girl with this hangar just  this art they had to go to work what he would do is take a light towel and wrap it around the tile that way he could be there in a woodless ceremony marks that way she could go to work and see the look of the adoption where it's getting close, it's still a pretty good match here on the lower thighs that you can try to hear right on the platyptics. So one of my earliest visions was I remember any being in a back-me-coming in to Duane's house and there was some commotion and we set to talk, , you told her to just get out of here and we set down and we start talking, I think we're watching a game or something  that and you can hear stuff being thrown in tossing it back and obviously any was upset about something. Anyway, at that point, doing called her out of the room, I can go in and get the code hangers straight in and out. And he said to her, he says, Any come here. And he's , act  she said, and he's bitch get your ass in here. Right? And now he's yelling, top as boys, get your ass in here. This point, he told his bitch, Ben, over right here, drop your fucking pants. I'm sitting now a bit stunned. I'm , okay, , we'll roll with this. , Annie comes over. At this point when he flies into the tire and he's yelling Bitskitscha ass over here, she's  out of tension. She comes right over and he's a Bitsch dropped your mother. She pants bent over, grabbed your knees. And I'll never, I'll never forget to look on her facts. It was almost very robotic, but she walked right over at a point where she was acting wild and in out of control, but there was a point that she reached. When he started to talk to her that she's snapped and she just got very robotic and he had total control over her. She walked over and I swear her ass couldn't have been three feet from my face and she pulled her pants down, bent over and grabbed her knees. And he whacked her with this colonel saying, right on her ass. I mean she was black naked, no panties, no pants, no dress, no nothing but naked. He hit her with such force that the outline of that code hanger was on her hands. And it cut her skin and she blabbed. And as I was looking at her when she pulled her pants down, it was clear that she had been beat  this before because they were several black marks where they had healed from this code hanger from previous beaters. At that point, he hit her again. On the third time he went to hit her, I grabbed his hand out, told him I said, I'm going nuts and nuts. He said, man, this whole, she knows she oughta lie. I mean, I'll beat this bitch's ass more. And at that point, I was in, man, let's take care of some business. He said, okay, he said, I'm gonna pull your pants up. Even after I stopped him, and we were talking, she was still standing there bent over with her hands underneath. He finally told her, and he put your pants to youFine's!!!!! It's Porter pants, panties up. White is just really interesting image because she poured her panties up first. You could see the blood go right through her panties so you could see the red so you could give her panties. She poured her pants up to walk in the back room. She was quiet  nothing happened. It was just incredible. And I thought to myself, it could be true. I mean, to not have compassion. for now the purse. it's really funny. I didn't openly show any remorse about these girls. I didn't openly feel sorry for them. We didn't do it. Any was getting a beat with them. And when I grabbed the way in his hand, my thing was man, let's take care of our business. I didn't say it in a way I was  me. You were a boy. I said it in a very nice way,  man, this I have no time for your shit. This bitch out here and listen to what we're gonna do. I didn't show  to serve, right? You see, because these are  internal conflicts that I'm having,  all means, , everyone up here, less than. So, though these issues are twirling around in my mind and they're starting to bother me, I'm not letting them know. I'm happy. But I'm still, these are just my own confidence that I'm starting to have. So I'm still excited about the temper. I'm still excited about the possibility that maybe just maybe this stuff will pass for me. , but deep down inside, I can't even move in, deep down inside and would because I was a compassionate person. But I was hoping that would. Why did he die in front of me? I think part of it was was psychologically to demonstrate his control over her. There was that aspect of it. That was for me. That was for me to me. But also on the other hand, there was that the breaking down of a person's constitution. Will he's able to do that to her? Eventually at some point she stopped believing in herself and she only believes in me And so once you can get that transferance Get a person today how no self-esteem work no lap no sense of self-worth lap Then the only thing that they can do is believing you They start to associate their own sense of self-worth and self-esteem to the very person who took their own The list goes directly to the app to why at some point, holes want to make their hips the best pimps. They want them to have the biggest hat, the biggest cat-, the longest shoes, the longest coat. They want them to have this because in the sense they live, I carelessly do that person. This sense of self-reliance and self-worth is all incumbent on the form, how they're This is my pin stress  pins. When you have a small, a relatively small community, and when I say small community, I'm talking about pets and a small community of men who are buying for your children and women, then it's all going to depend a lot on how much attention a guy can break himself in a way that's how much  what you call a peacock. Central, , our peacock, they have the plumage, the males have the plumage and they can be kind of sturtin' around in their, there's bread in their wings and they're trying to get the attention out of female. And in a lot of ways, pips are that, that have that same kind of mentality. It's  who has the brightest colors, the biggest has the most fur, the longest leather. I don't think they think in terms of whether this is  how I will appear to the... community as a whole, but rather they're making a statement to a very specific group of people IEV and the Pumps and other ho. I asked Kevin what it girls did just leave and strike out on their own. Right bother to have a pimped at all. He said prostitution is too territorial and given the potential dangers of selling your body måste. have somebody on your side even if it isn't pinched. And in their own twist, where they did provide something to family. The thing about it is that these were relationships. But I think that's what people, so yeah, unless it wasn't a business arrangement assisted, that I say to you publicly and as a result, I do detail the same. These were relationships, much  families. People would say, come be a part of my family, you can be a part of my family, you can be a part of my family's family. I mean, stay, we can be part of my student in the house. It's back to the matter. Is it that stable? Maybe describe this family's. This is how we live. We have a house. We have nice pin house. We kind of cars. We kind of, , I got my, I'd put off the time. The girls had cars. She'd get back on the floor to work. We got all that stuff. You don't have to worry about anything. Except for just working and being a part of the family. So it was never. I think what could use this people is... that people try and figure out how the girls have a single purpose of their own in terms of their own money, but it was never  that. You moved in. You became a part of that whole exciting lifestyle that he would live in. And as a result, money was really incidental to the high-stall and the whole. You think women you go into prostitution? there's something that happens  what age of 10, when it's set in, that this self-esteem issues. What I would say was that a person who has issues of self-worth and self-mosell distinct would probably be a better candidate to become a whole or a prostitute than someone who didn't. That sounds fairly obvious to anybody who would hear that is, well, that's pretty obvious. But the thing about it is that it's not self-esteem. into people necessarily where that's so obvious to see in a person. And so I think that's what makes some good shifts is the little probing of a person to find out where they're at. Give you the example of a very simple program, a real mind you used to do. He'd been a club that he'd meet a girl and he would go up and let's say he's having a talk to us, she said that that's coming next to him and he would after a bit of a big... after a small talk conversation and say, by me, it's great. Now obviously some girls with automatic say, hi, I own Drake. Are you by me a drink? But someone will win by a ma drink. That's the little kind of probing stuff that people do. You see, because just two five minutes of just little conversation, now on the side, he's seeing that he can exert his will over this woman. The she, in a henna. not even in a conscious way is basically giving in to your real. Sometimes it's that same, something as small as that. Coming up across the dude who likes to talk a lot, Kevin's own rise in policy camp, and whatever happened to all the 70's members. It's in a minute, a public radio international, way north. program continues. It's American life, America glass. Most weeks on our program of course, which is a theme for a new variety of stories in that theme. Today we're devoting our entire show to one story about Pimps in the 1970s. After that era, this particular culture of Pimping died off. But the Pimps of that era, with the flashy clothes, the big hats, the pretty shoes, they had become American icons,  Cowboys or Aspenons. Kevin Sturkey. Państ spirits was that. I met a girl named Louis Louis and she was top beautiful bruvnet 16th tall just gorgeous just gorgeous group and I remember  the I was for me with the game I did not want to lead on to her that I was but no idea she wanted to lead on to me that she was  I had always aspired to be a papal who was familiar with the game and knew how I'd win I knew she was a ho but I was never a culture  that and I knew she was She was struggling to tell me, , because she was trying to feel me out. So as she finally got on her, she said, well, why did you come by my job? Come down to my house. She was staying over in Belmont at the time. Come down for the weekend, when we came to my place, she had been to my place. I was going to do a dinner in the city, and so I said, okay, I'll do that. So it's so, it's very clever how she did this. It was really funny and it's, but she wanted to see how, how, how I played. this house. So she told me to come and get her. Come on my job and get my cake and then you can just go to the house. I got food and everything. You can get yourself some useless weight now be there in a few hours. I said okay. It's all the speed. Yeah, that's something to myself. Okay. So I'm I'm so I'll pull on the back of this place and as it turns out, let's massage. Right? So I'll pull up this. back and I go back to that corner. I said, I know some here and back. So she comes out which he's trust normally. Seven nice and dressed and everything. So she's up to the car she gives me a big kiss. Oh, I'm so glad this is going to be so exciting. , I can't wait to get home and , here's a key. I said, okay, give her a pack of the chicken on my bottle full of. She's well, oh, by the way, take this home. She hands me and envelope. Full of cash. Obviously, I don't think this was a day's wages. I think she had probably not been with somebody for a while. And she had been saving her money up. Had about $2500 in cash. And to me, I mean, this looked  $100,000. So really, I was , whoa, okay. She didn't give it to me. She says, she says, by the way, can you take this to my house for him? She hands me this damn book, and that's it. That's mine. I said, sure. So I'm busy. and I didn't do a house later she finally makes it home. She calls me at season and there's one in your house and one of my wife's guys and then she's got the whole, I mean it's obviously a sad,  the flowers. There's a place called Asams that's so being poured in flowers from Hawaii, , sixotic flowers and she and these exotic flowers from Los Angeles all over the house. All the easy garden mall shape is nice. So when he left happening, she ended up getting here about 6-30, several times and he said, I'm , I can get you some chat, and she looked at me, and she smiled, and I said, I said, oh, by the way, I put your money over, , nice day by your bed, ? Because she said to me, oh no, you could keep it as for you. And I'm... that and I kind of smiled and I said, what exactly is it that you do? And she's me as a woman, she said, , damn what I do. And we just started laughing at each other, ? And we stay together. From that point on, we stay together for, you guys are about seven years. Seven years. I remember being in the Black Knight as a mouse after the group of people and one of the things about the mouse was the two-spare of the art teaching for working for. And we would have lively conversations near her. I mean, that was one of the things that we enjoyed and we would have lively conversations. But one of the things was that when you sit in the group of guys and every home we place right? Just take it second position today man and so they basically are at this point where they don't speak until they're spoken and so when I come move now us she's disrupting this whole thing I mean she's gonna all this put up because  what because I'm talking she's talking she too  what I mean and she not waiting for me to stop to get hurt all cat at all she's talking as a separate energy on to or sell And not only is it talking, but she'll talk to some other man. You see what I'm saying  some other comes in here. So you see, I wasn't just treating her as her. I was treating her to some degree as a partner to me. So our relationship is different. And that created a deaf and powerful, and we're gonna sit around table with it, want some pills, but it's a whole new world of the same. Not the domestic spoken thing, but this bitch is right in her mouth, then I'm out. talking about the same shit we talking about. Every home in the gym is looking at a single shit. Is this bitch? what I mean? This bitch is out of life. You need this life. That bitch in the mouth and make a shout out. I actually used to get a kick out of it. I thought it was funny. that she was, she was spirited. I could of course. She was spirited in strong will. And I actually liked that. But for her, that was that was a very good trade to have. Is that... guy used to basically be hard time. If you come and read that bitch and come. He got to that point. what I mean? If you come and read that bitch and come on man. Because that bitch is disrupting it. She disrupts it to the game. I wonder if they got what they have on them. Won't hurt around me. I believe me over the years I heard people say, I heard people say, man, man, , what I mean? Yeah, I mean,  what I mean? But I even got that from my friends, my best friends. So do your friends, I love you, boy. Sure. So at this point, Kevin's become  a Pimp who can't shoot straight. And this friend... keep a rating in for fraternizing with lowest or never giving your clothes that most of Paul and his that Kevin still dating his child with sweet and refined their expensive gifts all paid for low season money. This is the thing that the guy is going to be the worst. The guy said, , no, what you're doing as well because what I would do the lowest was probably making  a city from 4 to 6 health. Now I will show it. Official greetings, have you seen? I mean it's been incredible amounts of money on it. I mean diamond rings, the whole necklace is, that was another thing the guy says, I said, it's a good matter if you're seeing it, , it's true. She's , she got a music and he's been, , money, square girl, this girl, this painting,  what I mean? She says, she, and that was one of the rules of the game,  what I mean? Okay, you can, money, and how this really was square, rubbed. because then the way you be in a track, just  the track who's been my agent to help. You see, and so this was , they ain't gonna understand, I mean, this was  a total of competition. Yeah,  what I mean, it's , how you hold your pen, does she get money from you? So then you turn around and be in a track. We did have a case where Lewis had to explain that was , how would you exactly know? It's so easy. that time she had not the house and she had been told that it was  maybe a week or something  that. , this is  totally in some sort of good way to make it. Maybe that's the shit. Not a lot of new love poppin' the next season. So, I'm gonna have it. I'm done having my business and after a couple of days, , you stay up to poppin' the nice and worry, but after couple days, you could be too new to the world and then you stay working soft on. But I remember the sort of  awesome house and men voices and just kicking, right? I remember a wasselet house that glattered it up and you were , hey, how's it going? , and scum's in, this is kind of a kid's of him. I remember the guys and so I felt  to some extent had to do something, I had to act. I couldn't imagine just  Eric, we walking  them with the guys in here. So I remember a wheel around and I slapped, , I slapped him. I slapped him hard, I slapped him hard. And when I slapped her, she fell to the ground. And she's  just lanked him,  not that. she was  that, I'm thinking myself. , she's, , that she had her head on she's going down. I mean, what is how it is about it. So she's laying there. I remember, look. I was going to round and I think it was Mark who was there. And I remember Mark looked at me and he had to sort of look at the space. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did . I did not. He was out. I changed his own feelings for some. Almost. Almost without thought. I remember I had to stay here. I did. and he's whacked across the back of his pool. Just a bad as hard as I can. He broke the pool sticking past. And let me touch. I've never seen nobody jump up as quick in my life. This girl is  she is past. I've never seen nobody jump up so quick in my life. This girl jumps straight up off the floor and ran off the back, they're two to kids, they're not off the back door. I mean, she just jumped. I was almost  she had spraised. They're two more mispers. and then that bitch jumped my ear. This is man that bitch that bitch slap, she was black  she was black, she was gone later all night if you were in there. So man, bitch is playing with me. You must be safe and don't know what man. You need to take care of that bitch. That bitch is straight in the mouth. What do you want to hit her if you were alone? Punisherna In- mixerna? probably wouldn't. , probably better. Only because I'm loaded. I would know that it was in the morning. It was what was known. Yeah. It's almost  a hat to it's she knew it. It was really funny when it was that later she got bored because I lived a fairly lifestyle she got bored but I remember one day her remember one day this guy heard pulling up to my door and knocking on the door and it's a lot of look how this loons and she's got this guy with her right he's a guy who actually had known I'd seen around who I knew to be a pimp than jir and jir it says and look let me talk to you for a minute So he said, he says, he said, love man. The hell she retails. She doesn't mean he's going to be a man. He said, , I hope you'll have a problem with learning this man. I just want to come and become a human man. Let ,  what time it is. That's really funny. It's dignified and it's much a part of the game that I had been and as much as I have seen. at that point I said him five so that's fine she can I was real dignified about so that's fine you can go  and I'm approaching she wanted to get a close set up his gang is my mama and have a period and it's really funny because say in the name of the guy my shit did  should have said it's true so hey but at that point even after all it's training after all it's school and after all of being around and having to understand how the game goes, at that point, a loss, , and I was , no, you got it, but the biscayne has to be a f***ing thing. And there's really plenty of top-y something about me today, as well as when you were really belittired today, but yet again, I will always come back I'm back to, but our memorandum leaving and our memorandum returning from 15 minutes later with the lace. They came in, they took all our clothes and they left. Now  what? They had every right to it because the name of the game should have damaged back any way. But at that time, also angry, she was reverting back because what did the case you had always said was that she was so glad that she didn't have it. traditional hip-hop whole relationship. She didn't know long ago, gonna be a part of that. But what she taught me was that she longed for she actually did missing. She thinks she just lost respect. She thinks she didn't care about anything. I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think it's some point. She, , she needed somebody. I actually needed somebody who helped those thousands of people involved. I use the she-held higher than what I held them. That was tell me. I didn't care if she bought $100 home. And I think when she started to realize that I didn't care, that was so much a part of her self-esteem. , she always prided herself in her ability to make money that way. And yeah, I think she starts saying, keeping you and getting the camera clean up. You don't get what you're talking about me. That my not caring about the money for me translated is me not caring about her to her. Were you heartbroken? At the time, yeah. Yeah, it is this happened. After lowest, Kevin and a few other girls, but his heart wasn't in it. He just wasn't an American pen, and they knew it too. Eventually, they left. Well girls would be around and who had who would be with guys who would be with them. They would soon find it that I didn't feel that need and they'll, in terms of being able to control them, in terms of already having a few. desire to, in terms of how a role , to have them. And so as a result, they would, I would even give rid of them, I'd even give rid of me, more even death. Ha! The first time I was in the world I was in the world I was in the world Finally, after a few years Kevin got out of the gang, by then it was almost the 80s and Tim things times. The vice-copsized boat used at women's lift NODAFTA發現 it couldn't stand it anymore, giving all their money to a man, Kevin said it's a combination of that and crack and peanuts, and he said he's eating. Crack cocaine sets you down. When you smoke that stuff, you have no desire to go anywhere. It almost  you're involved. , it starts also trickle down from the fence to the fence. Now, they're guy who's doing it. All this stuff of steam is looking up that. All this time is not safe. Now, so this is not the same personality was once before, ? It's not Righy, he's not fun  he used to be, he's not excited anymore. He don't have this old God complex of being, I'm still great in this net. And everybody these guys that I'm telling you about, got involved with cracking. Every single one of them. And eventually, they goddamn it. long-stop vision. It took out many of him, many of him. Did any of them realize as it was happening that this was a downward spiral? No. Not a single person ever stopped to think, well , maybe this game is good, no, maybe it's happening. Maybe it's happening. There's always thought they would come in back. They will come back. It's always one whole way from coming back on the yellow top of the game. I think the guys who were smart, who aspire to something better, they would always have used the game as a means to getting somewhere else and that was very clear. for the guys who were purely in the game for the game itself and felt from day worth that the Pimpman was all they wanted to do that's all they ever did they live it no time simply no Kitejo  a rap that was really, really perfect he doesn't have little moment in bringing it up give a love and truth of the change. And that's the thing that I always love that. I always understood the purity, my wish they approached what they did. And they're pure love of, ? I always admired. And I still do the destroy. I still love the purity of which they loved. And they studied it and they elevated it to art. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. Kevin today makes a living in the straight world creating jewelry for rap stars. He spoke with my brother, I don't want to. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. And I'm going to teach the way, to never see the purpose of this world. To be kept in the air, to put your way up and up, and I'm going to teach the ways of the world. I'm going to teach the ways of the world. I'm going to teach the way, to be kept in the air. for what the Lordless Show taught me and in that, for the Father, for that, am given the world.
