  "text": "to be the easiest photo from a couple of very international, to American life in our class. My name is Marlene. I'm a senior at Lake New High School. I had a crush on this one that I've been for years. At first, it was , you should be having to know and then after a while, it's okay, really know you. And you really know me. So do  me kind of, ,  giving out hints, but that really is. saying anything and then it goes into the right. Okay, and trying to think, when you walk down, how trying to touch hands to see if you'll actually grab your hands, stuff  that. Yeah. Yeah. In this times where it's  that, who doesn't  you. Then, then there's times  this, and when you're saying, you look at me because  who have to do it. You see, it's , oh my god, no. What are you doing to me? , this is totally mixed signals. With a crush, everything is my intense. Everything your crushy says and does is pretty, is such. Mmm. I was all the amazing comments. Okay, I was told every single one of my friends. This is a, I was, yeah, stupid little, I have a cute scenes thing. , and I was, yeah, I was , yeah, I can't get over it. Oh, I'm going to dare. I was the highlight of my day, man. Having a crush, anybody knows, means being utterly miserably rejecting, and completely filled with hope at the same time. But every four years, and on again, I've been crushing the sky. Just last time, my game started seeing somebody else. And he says that compared with data, the crush is better in certain ways. I hope you don't know who's here. , it's right to, that kind of , trying to bump into him every day, start feeling , well, you start dating somebody. It's just a normal thing, ? It's  something spontaneous. If you have a crush, you can't even just be in his way. It's just spontaneous, exciting thing, ? If you have a boyfriend, it's just  you think. Yeah. Okay, it's three o'clock. I see you now. what I'm saying? Yeah. What's in our program? We're Valentine's Day. Stories about love, interlead stage, crushes. What's terrible about them? It's great about them. I have a can-overshadow real love for some people. It's  one of our programs. Pissed by a school because it's a story of crush the last day of the lifetime. Back to how a bill becomes a president. In which a press secretary for a major president's campaign explains the dynamics of crushes. are not about what about politics, that tree, once seeing the 100% perfect girl one April morning, in which one lonely crushy, finally figures out what it was that he wanted to say, what we all want to say. As the person of our dreams passes us on the street, 隨ous faded places, echoing. So what if you've held onto a husband's press? I'd be working this into it never go away. Try as well, he's the same. When Joe read this 4x15, his craziness over a girl, since Bert and Sam, in such a curious small town where they were, his mother threatened to pack them off, they're a sister, so they're gone. But before this, they're gone, but so's thought-ball. I guess. Mother Collect the large sum of the questions, so-called, and farmers. And move to the cell and cell to call it. Thirty years back. In that time, he heard nothing. The girl, Mary, 12, 12. But now and then, word of verbito, look at that. She dropped out of high school. She's here at a baby. Got Mary. Of course. We married a few weeks later. That second marriage, the last day, he'll learn about their fraud until he got the need to correct that. He dropped by his mother's house and suddenly after they had coffee debt. And that was when she told them that they're clogged and gave him the rent. He didn't want to be thinking about what re-action was for us to get them. So he excuse himself. It took me about a round-side to the back yard. Courting. to the newspaper, with much friend and so, very clawed appeared to a fallen seat, wheel, and drifted into the arm coming way in a trap. She didn't tell about life, and so had the driver of the car seat, and that was the bell in there, on his way home, in the new front vision. That was the news for a time. The elephant, which his mother's friend aspired to pass the ball in any time, was that very clawed and then had him a flight, with a view of sailing in there, she asked. Chip Ryan drove the same unusual cars to death, a red Mercedes station ride, and Mary Clark had people who'd be sleeping bold, must have him be heard of him, how to a blue. Both of them lived outside town, and frequently passed the check to come and go. The story was, whenever they met on an empty-stracted road, they played a game where they switched lanes the last moment, a sort of Robert thing. Keep on. That must be it. in the depth of car of presents and that is that. So, it could hardly make sense. His mother's friend got it in his true, but conceded that it certainly wasn't perfect. I'm very glad could have fallen asleep. Just a hundred feet past the city, I heard. Still, she wrote, there were probably other ways to explain, without itself, and , give it up. to survive by her hug. We killed two men. Some reason they were having fun of picking them. He's Joe Black. Joe had lived in another smirk. Pelots, one known to go down. In this other one he hadn't left out of it. But it stayed on. It just never was. He fell into this dream during the first month after the move. In the emergency in the summer on a sun-stucked street, full of old sheep, where sprinkled granite on lawns, building a bed in that room. When his mother left her darkened bed with long enough chasing outside, he looked up the Saturday evening post, who was pulled in a nearby pot, and walked the girl's oil truck and parked her glistening way and then replaced by two of the three. He's right on his stomach, scared host, and lived with ghost men. There's a fire. After Joe started to see a smudged dog in the tent, and I hop, spurted with him. A few months later, she and another one were the perfect ship, and bought him over there off. Joe's mother could be dressed smartmen. Some wore her hair straight, instead of piled up on her hat. But it's a great suit. One night at dinner she called, Joe, such a way you realize you can speak in the background. He's no one. When he looked at her, she said, he can't bring him back, so you have to let him come. Joe was embarrassed, yeah, within the center stand, and he played a role. He let her face you dreadful. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Go, go. This will be new right past. The echo in hallways was students moving and draw the joke and they hear as it has fixed silence. The sometimes wet home without having spoken a word and said, seen the hen, the hen might go through the whole year that way. And the next year too. So he's correct. But the four laws he became friends with he's biology law. He took him to the park and he's still there. And Joe got a driver's license that straight. He began to call. The ACE2's course played off the truck, the less that's there. And the fall of the senior year, he and Carla left dance for the rectum of the tall. He first time was open and failed. He tried again a few days later in Carla's bedroom and had better one. And by Christmas, Joe was starting to see court on the slide. He didn't really prefer her, but it seemed that I would have over the sooner or later. either here or part of the unfavorable, if you want to keep one. It turned out to be much more cognitive than the law. There was soon exposed the nouns by both girls at the part of the seat. It's did not turn down. It's entirely disparate, uttered, British going out. And through all this, you continue to stand from light, never cloth. It was with her on a blank, in a movement clearing, and a car parked above the river. Great Charles on the radio. fingertips, raising the back snap. And now, I'll go from the roof, the car on the face of his lips, the teeth, the throat. Only the kiss memory, only kiss memory. He hardly did anywhere, very far except they make his smooth got, speed, and a few times in town. They're from the kiss, they made everything wrong, or everything else made itself without any effort, imagination, or sexic, only else. He watched his life very close, go on as he had watched the news. Seems through more practice than it was time to have each new one, brain by those who had gone for it. Go with, yes, the heart. At Berkeley, Joe went with Maldives. And when Maldives left for a year of sore bond, he went back. pants, who can't share the house to a pet, so they'd regret. Afterward they went to the apartment of their own, who drove first to the event. Then, can this what to me or is it family and never to pet? She sent Joel a letter that she asked, to give his problems because they're off the home. She was now in the process, but he said she couldn't return to the life she'd read in birth. It's impossible. they had their troubles to it. He's been going all out, so he can't wait for some nights she worked for to be green and damped. Of course, they were called, but nothing that's. He certainly didn't graduate into the new acquisition, but when Bill's mother heard about him screaming, the first thing she said is that she hopes she gets in help but they'll have to mention the matter. But time is starting, he's ready. Seattle, he'd enter the state here in Clark, made me shadowed by more moon and sail than him. Gems to me is just three hours north, Seattle. Sometimes thought of driving up on a sea after noon, but never did. By then he heard Mary Claude with Mary. There was no purpose in making sure. said to see her, who's afraid she wouldn't want to see her. The girl also worked very, she worked. She worked for that. She had a daughter, her, and the house, and she had worked. So did the used it, exactly. If he tended on a prayers, he knew he could rely on. That he had to improvise day by day. He lost the food. He could not rest please. The Mary Cautons will fill her been married in 7 years. White was the pediatrician, same clinic that he practiced as a intern. They had a son in junior year of high school, got her a year ago. The boys get to the church, unwilled. Rose, God has not sleep again, that person is the pastor, that she is. Vio began taking. Her rock climb, she still breaks, she turned out to be the most fearless, and in that apartment he never had. Then came the time of his daughter's season, both daughter and son, developed high and source of the movement , and Bill began to detect a certain concept there had them. His children were slipping away into the deep forest. He tried not to Baruń who took a��ary sens Butter Liz too thought. When they first met, she was perfect, and unsure of self-speaked, and he was old. Since then she'd gone called, he felt unsatred and sick. In their love making, he approached her almost, and sometimes, he'd be with a bark of child, as if he brought a notorious bird, a way from hurt for more than a day or a day. He'd never been hurt for more than a day or a day. to show hardly a new room. And still, through all these new head thoughts, very close. He thought of Mary Clark sitting across and taking barely the way he was caught. He thought of him standing on a porch and waved his friends so long. And when they were alone, Mary Clark turned and slipped in arm around, and they went slowly inside and it flutters a good stain. Stop! Sometimes , God knows all of this, the moment. Just feel remembered very well that it's quite the smell of God. The Atlantic, much as anyone could, for it's wellness, they were going back. It played just over two months. Mary Clark's father owned a very long several miles out of town. But mother has moved away in Mary's closet, but mother, taking her daughter's it. She married again, the things did not go well, she thought this week. And she set Mary's closet, father, that she was six. Joe had gone through the first six years, grades, barely noticed, grabbed me and did not and she came back to which Mary's closet, walked away on the couch. The back art is  a bottle. She had no friends except her friend was cousin. During volleyball games in the gym class, she bathed the other girl but they lived in the ball a lot of town or in the map. She cut class, slept, and made out of other girls  them. They're so upset. And Joe, curious, tested, found truth. Very hard went behind the school, and wearing their pants and they would see some women but I would still ask what happens to them... Now, tap them out over an hour. she's doing shape day. First step, right? So, one. And once it starts, pretty stops. Hmm. Do  how to do it? No, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Beep. that it's the watch for serious operation at a safe haven when inevitably he's forced to be treated. But he didn't remember to try anything else that meant, meaning against the amazing wall that he spurled, tasted so good, pressed so full of evidence. Univine's mere mistakes, the unswated, the savage behind him. There were other couples who won the wall and Joe knew who. take their analysis. But when it started to be in the way, Mary's father, Adrian C. was chief's guidance now, back at the birds, and after that, thought about he would escape their own night, no such time as, if I may have grown up, they now pulled Mary's father alive, they just hit the home. He turned to go, and stop, just go again. Walk around the school, and ask what going back. So, Jim is almost up. State, Black, Black, Black. When he saw Mary Clark in the hallway at Monday morning, he did not attend the night and half. Lord, he she. She had been take her books and walk the class. Have a much period of the works of the tap. bacteria and set a cost in 10. You understood what would happen, the hot shell around it, how they'd look at, even by the scratch. Joe knew the rules, he'd been as sh** and heard a nice girl, and for a very clawed of all things. You could make out Mary's clawed, but you had to laugh not at me, cut them. They ate it out, pop. The color's high, otherwise she gave nothing. He helped the soft, his parents, and that was not. They were a parent. There was a furniture going on in the spirit. There were the stands that put both empty cloth. He tasted a blitz in cigarettes, tom. But she opened for now, here's the first sensation, shock of relief, tightness, milk to get a lot of natural. Then he swear at it. that smoke-to-seed, drinking for platforms at the schoolwork you have not done, STEM to develop. His mother gave, hey, all the room at the end of the hallway where his father made gas and that's breath,  a trout clocked on the internet. He forgot to plan when trying that, where did touch, how hard he was? He stopped picking the hall. There was no man, no before and no act. He's a huge person. He could satisfy all of us. And Mary Clark's thirsty for help. He'd never have this help. Yeah. He grew up in a patient, to his grieving face. She did not  to break off. When he leaned away for a breath, she would close her food to his mirror and pull him back. She sometimes said his name and, of well, almost mocked way and the sound of it with him around, which she'd yet got on with. Mary Clark soon did carry out the cards. She didn't care who saw them or when. She commanded his that her found she boarded her bus for in the hall. Even on the street town where the father's got to go in to shop at school. They'll knew that it went beyond the house. But she was making a display that they're at. Perhaps a special a little, just yeah, a little hug point of that. And then this made so crowned, right, too. He didn't mind what he thought he even started to show. The two of them stitched the other half of them out as he muttered. Those mutters and heard about. She heard everything mutters. At first she threw in at him a slam down and she lost. Is this the time carrying on some girl? Couldn't he sit with his father a while instead of moaning in his room Specifically. The back and two months to ask, Joe knew she'd care if he was getting a little trouble, but nothing she said actually. He wasn't doubted the certain burger he did. He and Mary Claude were in the stands during the basketball. She was called, she wanted to leave, go outside. Joe kept putting her off, the game was close. She started to play with the care of the naked he's next. He's there. He liked the feeling, and almost so that 17th of over struck the earth in his eyes. He felt Mary thought, go still, sign. Emotion was looking at him and kept his eyes on players, and even produced a shout for him to pass. Mary thought, slid her feet back against him, tightened them and began to turn his head for a bird. Without taking his eyes to the end. He gave a rush shake full the way. Mary Quatt stood up, but waited there, I told him. And there Joe knew he could still turn the Earth, even then he did not. He made her way to the aisle. He watched her descend the steps, crossing front of the stairs, and lead the ship. The game had become numerous, and he sat through the rest of it. And now he's heard the sun. Zifledomo the Western borrowers last stop stories republican international property No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now, now, now, now, now. It's a snack in my class. It's even a problem with courses. It's a good excuse. Balance, brushes, it's a bad balance. The vice-war continues to the sun. Bill phones very far at the top home, but no one asked. He called again, before he went to bed, someone picked up at the same. Very caught you, sir. Very caught you. He would miss. He knew she was waiting for him to give an account, just by himself, and he could say what he said in the air, all he could say. very caught. She hung up whenever. He pushed notes into the block. He got no ins. He met her bus at that she walked right past. He waited outside her plastic and followed her down the hall after the bus stopped at the school. He knew he was making a food. So, he had no choice. No other way. His mother heard about it and demanded that he leave the girl alone. They made their gibts. Jump to the trail very close. They still married for not good one. They had one class, but washed the steaks. He sat, he seems ahead of it, and the next row to the left. He could watch Mary's vlog without seeing what. He was alert to any movement that allowed him a few of his very fun now. He often turned to look at the plot that he saw and Joe never failed to seize that glint of her face, co-file, the highest for it, full mouth. When he saw her mouth, he followed, narrowing the distance by at least that. It was wrong that he could put his mouth at her. It was an impossible mistake. He kept him back and gone in. She must be seated with his shoulders. Sure of that. If he was cut off from her, she was cut off from him. She was that silent too. But it went on and on. Joke into understand Mary Claw didn't know how to end. She was waiting for him to find that. But what could he do? She would be sweet. And she wouldn't even look. She'd be getting. the hell dog. Hell was he seen? Why a well-matched blood, he struggled to escape, had a red hole in it. He lived, he stepped the road from there, crawling. He drove to school. And Mary called, started writing, and he was going to see the boss. They often ate watching them. They'll few first. Then he saw that it's sick of him. He waited for hell outside of the good side. Yeah, tell me, that Mary's quite... himself. And Alvin, listen, he tried to breakfast, the Joe was to talk block he's wet. Al- Push, and he's bad  this, he's right down, he's metal-graced clocked up the country. Joe got to help him up, the two boys ran over and shoved him aside. One of them gave Joe a look, stuck at the lift-out seat. Joe sprinkled. We fast getting in. Everyone's back from no choice smile and joy and talent and all You could see when he got home, the mother already remembered She sat in the work store, spoke with her only what she had While he was doing the dishes that night, she couldn't be the kitchen Told him that his sister for husband will willing to have a joke company down So things got so down So stop, sure. For face, it's class, rise brilliant. Student back to a way of first look at it. She was , yes, he is. Did he want to go to San Diego? Did he want to do that? No? Was he sure? All right, you said. He needed him here. But one more thing  this, he'd be on the first bus out of town. Did he understand? Good. Now she wanted Joe to go to his father to make the same post. Joe did no such thing. He received the weird submarine crickets emanating from his father's box. And studied the pattern he was drawing, and answered a few easy questions that schoolwork. And then he got there, how loud he was. But not the four-he's father could be drawing, yellow, and on Joe's wrist. Hold me. down and doing embrace the breath of sin. He stopped following Mary Claude class. She wrote school without God and they sometimes ate together. The joke seemed there was nothing to him. She was alone and before. So was Joe more than ever. The guy who picked up clips. He didn't follow Mary Claude but he was. nearby when he called, that most people in the distance. Cock her head to hold her lock her door and attack her. Terrain the fuel of an orange, strong white. He's late in the couple of weeks, schooled the over. And he'd have no way of breaking the spell he's got. He decided he could kiss her. She was  him. After the first case, she always walked another. But that's... another until she lost herself. That's what they need. He lose himself. Mary Claude's gym teacher rolls outside of one day's softball and track. Just French class in that period. But he sometimes cut out room standing, shaking, shaking, trees, and watching Mary Claude. When the teacher webbed the class back inside. Very clawed, always made a point that blanked far behind, said the force that had helped the others had no had no hold on her. He stood under a horseshoe, just not true, sighted half that left in the lock-up. Tree was in blue. The eyes got easy and raw from the power. She drew near to him, he spoke her name, and she looked up without surprise. He had several off-planed out to say, but now that he was pushed to her, forgot what it was. Which is the world's worst. if he writes every of words. She weighed arms still cost, then she said, you've been crying? Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, it wasn't sure what happened, yes. Even right after it happened, you had no conscience, any of them, even in his own memory, and accepted the blame that fell on him without protests, without food. But he knew that it started with very close. Crack. God's eyes. He heard her mock as the Gips, for Gips, Suns, set of Russia feet in his face. Still feel, thinking back. Then he lost his soul. He remembered holding one of our hands, both his and her meaning away, and looked at it, it struck him perhaps. Then he remembered being with her and the tree, his arms, well, how they got there, could set. Maybe he met her there, maybe he really did, for a certain. The one thing he was sure of, is that her mouth opened into his, when the gym teacher grabbed his call. Even as she wrenched him back, shirt-cut, punched at his throat, he was strange, forwards, sealed at this. Then Mary-quad turned side, started gagged, and he knew he'd have started all over his room. He did not even know anything anything sad. His mother surprised by trying to make the principal feel sorry for her. Something he never seemed her due. But it didn't pay off. Principal refused to let Joe finish up here. As he was clearing out, block, couple of scene, block has, he made smooch and sounds. Lovers feet, put it on, Joe carried and stuck on the hole then. Those mother talked about sin, and he said, he made it, he was lying to refuse, but he never paid for sin. Late Wednesday afternoon, his father went into a cold. So he died that evening. So kept the watch, mother, crawling the bedroom, while his mother held her husband. He was steady, mother saw, gallant, gray. I'm not yet. Switched down, scared. Not there, not there the next time. So, mother of sex, yes. Yo's father, she's a- She's a- It made me think that. That works. Oh, I'm not wrong, I'm not wrong. I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- I'm a- Here took the letter and the mother's yarn, step along. Punched in a long shirt. Now those are his knees. He waited to be struck. Down the street, someone with glass, straps walls. He went up even then. He couldn't stop, no. Follow. Even he can't. He might need to switch to the tent. So he'd lost his throat. And after the tent, he's going out of the straps. Here, the bush is left. Share it, look. and sat down, but that morning, do still linger in these gaps, loving. And seep into his, warm, clean. The glass, true. Turned into the feet of God, he'd see his mother. Watch, he's cheap, though. Pulling along face, to watch you imagine, seep. What he did for you, is the guy's, a scam bone attempt, create a saw on my tubes. It's a. He rocks into the sea, looks sowing around, some waiting for a purpose to form, and started for the shed with a mullage. It would come later, if it came at all. Sometimes he lost patience, and hardly ever thought of that. And then, with a regret, he resigned with most polite. Same with a call, he killed not long ago on Lake Tahoe, but he hit a beer crew with all waters. But then, waters keep. such a fun track to know, the girl that could have a new touch. Now, if a tame it would come from behind and push in into a hole so he could get what it is what to be out. That was what happened with a beautiful news, Margaret, the sister of Omicile. She was 28. She had born to him. She had diabetes, drink and have diabetes. But somehow he failed to expect himself. She got caught. death, rape love. Something  it happened to him after his son's day. One night, holding the bed, he remembered that Kirk clarity he owned father holding him. Looking down, his father smiled. There was that rubbish death, he was too, a crazy up-curve item. There was a look of Hamac Ab spot. And now he's figured that by some trick of the mind he had imposed on a sea to discotheque call. A few days later, he was doing some papers with that clinic closed and looked up into the game court and there he was in the parents house in the hallway just outside the doctor. It hasn't stood there, unable to go. The weas in yellow face monster who had fallen in the grass Curved slowly. He smiled at kindly smiled and lifted his long yellow face and tried to sleep. So, cried out. For fun. The room had that shop, stepped in, but it's so no one could sleep. Ahhh... One more, had the captain. Shurp would post, a joke or rail the... and the question itself for it, it must be done. The spun through a corner saw he spun through the trunk, and then per face over made the black, orange. She looked at work. He all raised the hand, she made a little wave back. Same with the blackful wager, she did the party car, and they left him at the same way, same on certain smiles. Except información staff. Now she's full, that's very good. He turned his attention to the rock board where Frank plays last home. And when he looked up, he'd gone. Sand's to go, brown grip, shirt, so. As he worked, ceased to fit, where he built something. And then it seemed, to be with Dave, shit blind. So shit, man, tight first. Boy, I've been so dumb, suffering, show, rap, does. Chips older brother, a minute French. Chips to hang around while they're crazy, right? Talk, but he didn't body it, or act, rap. Show him the struck by math. What a nice little chip he did, little chip. Sitting there with his pad rap, struck him to you, swall he looked up. Little chip, everything. Little chip, everything. The letter didn't say when ship married was either way he was on the call, but it wouldn't be telecasted. But the ball of the girls in that long dream valley, he had this very clock. If it's true, of course it's true. And fully the mower through the last couple of curves, cut me. All of us on the book yard, in her denies it's been. violence, struts, still. He nodded up to see the long, subtle self-doubt, sure. He heard the pizza on the tide. Five, ten cents, making it either a part, grand rise, all of it. Cleaning the sweat, eyes have full. But when he reached for the name, he felt it stick away. It felt that it could not hold on something. know so well and he stood fixed as the music swells to a fit guy and the dog burns. By our store occupies several books including Night & Question and this Adams analyse Strike Yes, one for one in character I won was Arthur Stone who built compact and mounted head strength with reduced power. .... march thus fore flank sword War 2 and after AT LA Z Another thing about these events we have in our polls. Here comes the president. WHAAHHH It's well done. It concerns me this a bit. But the impact of the football players of the jury was that interest also chose to win. If the audience had their往 away in有點 My problem today is about crushes and this story is about a very specialized kind of crush the political crush. This is a crush that once only for a candidate to get elected to office, which is a rarely discussed force in our national life, Julia Rothwax, for example, since she doesn't care if she ever speaks with presidential candidate Bill Bradley, that she wants him to win the White House. Her political feelings for him started stirring when she saw him talk about the normally I'm trustworthy, subject with campaign finance and foreign, that's just one of his press secretary's in New York. She's worked for one other presidential campaign for another bill, Bill Clinton, 92, but after Clinton took off, as she says, the reality of his presidency, he did not mess up folks for it. She says, crushes exactly the right word. He's trying to figure out what he's trying to describe. But I do think there's parallels to sort of what you get, , that every now and then somebody comes along that makes you feel extremely hopeful and excited and then the professor only. think about that thing and then at that person. Yeah. What I think it's closer to is that feeling the falling in love than it is to feeling the crush,  it doesn't feel  the crush. It's sort of a process. It's sort of, have your first thing for your first thing to handle it. And at that first meeting, it's the reason that can't be financially from speech to practice games. You sort of geared, you're a cessage in the same way you would, , on a first date. You to speak and I was I was rude about it and  I wanted to hear more and I wanted to learn more and I got really interested. He's  you're yourself. He's very asked. Yeah and also instead of gathering a cake, it's  this is this person and are they  if they see them and yeah so you sort of go to that and then and then you sort of you commit then you sign up  full time staffers. So I actually left my job and I get stuff off and I, , I'm myself into this thing. And then she worked out. It's kind of a political problem. Is there a difference for you in the graduate and the way that it felt? Yeah, well, yeah, there's a few differences. I mean, one of the things that was a political fall in the love, it was, , my first time out. So, , you allow yourself, first of all, love you. All hard and then you. usually I guess end up feeling so different or just heartened or irrespectation through to eye and then reality sets in. And with Bradley I'm a little bit older, I'm a little bit wiser and he doesn't, , not these sort of love these things. He doesn't work in I guess, he's right. So he felt  Clinton that there was a feeling on the Clinton campaign that everybody should be sort of scarier about that. And Bradley's charming and in a sort of different way even, and he's got pretty pretty eyes and he's also a little straightforward mentality... But another big bucks point, and he's?? Do already steal my looks. Have youaron though, given the pressure of Nintendo nearly all in foreign language? But correctly? The Jazzier High School kind of first falling in love that maybe Clutch was for me and Bradley feels for a serious and for a short story. But  that I can get it from you relationship, but it's who we actually really were. Yeah. Obviously person at what he just, right. Is that potential? Is that potential of story? Is that, is that, is that, is that you, in this case? Let's let that. I guess with Bradley I have  that he keeps a lot of things that he's telling you what he's doing things. I think partly with what was hard for everybody is that kind of got the sense that he there were a lot of political deterioration behind what he said and with Bradley it does feel it feels more pure. Let's say that we're good. you have to be a child. And so talk about the most of the time. Because it's this is what you talk about. Right? There has to be a single. You think what you're working in politics? They don't have to deal in the work you're doing. They aren't idealistic. That's same way. , you can think of people who aren't. You can just be your parents. , I mean, , you want to believe me. You work. I think all the people, I think a lot of my friends, so I did the 92 campaign with actually, , everybody should have wanted to have to do it because it's a positive, it's a good feeling. Now, you get sucked back in and, , fix over your life and, , you start carrying maybe a little bit of thoughts and you have to be careful about it. You get to be worth it, you're going to, . get a response call with your time and your effects that your trip. I guess I feel  Bradley sort of doesn't eat that as a candidate. If you talk about it, it is a political falling in love, really, if you're looking, as you get old, you look for a sort of look for a different thing, looking for balance. You don't want quite as much of a pointless glow at those, or if there's no less glow at those, there I guess. If you want to think something you can get real close. You're a fun person. Both, you're a son. Obviously, is it you weren't talking about him on? I think he about me. A little bit of a fun, you're in school. You can get talking about him. Right, , my present. My first. What I'm actually following you love a real person, you might feel . I don't, I don't, I don't go out and go. But with, with, when I candidate, it's something fair. You're not good at that, but sit in. That's what nice stuff. It's got nothing about it. It's because  you do want to tell people because you discovered something that's great. But they can have it too. That's a different example of a couple of other lovers. They can't even sign up sign on and help us win this electric. Do your rock-blathas press secretary to build Bradley's campaign. I know you say you're always with me. I just can't you and see the passion and eyes of me. Actoring on seeing the 100% perfect girl on beautiful April morning. Because I said today with this story with a pure depiction of unadulterated crush feeling as possibly can be imagined from her Rookie Mark Kami to the first half of the night. One beautiful For more on a narrow side, look your special heart can make it. I walk past the 100% curve. Tell you the truth she's not that good looking. She doesn't stand out on that line. Close enough to the left. And back where hair is still bent out of shape, sleep. She isn't yet me. She's a close girl. But still I know from 50 yards away, she's the 100% curve. The moment I see it, there's a rumb in that chest, and now it's dry today. If you have your own particular favorite type, you'll want to swim ankles, say, a guy's, a graceful thing, or you're drawn for no good easy good girls. And at the time that you need. I have my own preference, yes. Sometimes in a restaurant, I'll catch you. Yeah, girl, it's nice to see you. And no one who insists one hundred years, or girl who is not some people who see the most. That right. I think it's called Chris. Small one. Well, I can remember her, she's a little bit easy. She's walking east west, and she's being... I'm sure. Have an out, we plant this. Ask for it, I'm sure. up and send. But I knew one. Explained word complexity, faint and glad word passing each other on side street and horizontal and fearful morning in 1981. And this was something sure that crample wants to see. And see clock built, he spoke with it. After talking, you have lunch something. Let's see what you have. That's my hotel bar. and lock them up in the corner. Potentially out of the box, will not. Now, we're just going to change the app. We're going to not. How many computers I see. Good morning, miss. You didn't despair half an hour for a little conversation. It's interesting, some of you should have seen. Pardon me. But would you have been inauthors in all my cleanerly? This is best. I'm a character in the lobby, one thing, and five. Maybe the simple truth would be. Good morning. You are the 100% proper girl. Not sure. She is not. Sorry. I might be 100% perfect for you. You can't say that. You can't say that. I remember cover from the shot 32 that we were growing olders all about. We passed in front of the flower shop and small warm animals, which is my scene. We asked all this stuff and then catch the scent of roses. We can't bring me some discomfort. She wears a light sweater and then right hand she holds a crisp lumpy of luck. So, we get into something , so, they just sent the whole night right, just to be looking at me. We'll go, say, let me see what she's doing here. I think it's more strides in time. We've lost in class. Now, of course, I know that, but it's said. But it would have been a long speech that I thought you'd be wrong. It doesn't happen. Yet he was , well, he didn't  it. It would have started once upon a time, and then did a sad story, okay? Once upon a time, they looked at the boy in the girl. The boy was 18, the girl was 16. He was not a new baby, and she was not special, beautiful. It was just an ordinary, long story. home to a computer. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world they lived the 100% per people and the 100% perfect girl. Yes, they believed in America and that miracle actually happened. One day they came upon each other on corner of the street. This is a news. I've been looking through all my life. They may not believe this, but you are the 100% perfect girl. And who? are the 100% per 4th, exactly exactly the same to do with the 3rd. It's  a dream. They sat on a park bench, held in the oldy turkey store, while one fell. They were not lonely, they had found and been found by their 100% per fifth of it. But a one dream that's found is found at one of the first. It's a miracle, a cosmic miracle. They sat in park. However, a tiny, only sliver of doubt took place in the box. Was it really all right for one's things to come to the fullest? And so when there came a military law on the conversation board said to the bill, let's test ourselves just once. If we really are each other's 100% purposeful, then sometimes, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, we will know that we are 100% purposeful. Realty. Mary, then in there, what do you think? Yes, that's that. And so they thought she could be used and he could be less. The test day to greet upon, however, was probably in this. They should never have undertaken because they really improved work, that is 100% and it was a miracle that they had ever more. But it was impossible to do this. The cold in different waves of state pursuit, costs of atmosphere. One wind her both the boy in the girl came down with a season's terrible influence, and after drifting for weeks from life and death, they lost all memory of their early weeks. When they awoke their head resentfully as the young theatre ones had figured on. They were too bright to turn and young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts, they were able to look up. Once again the knowledge and fears and qualified future spoke French months aside Haven't been praised they became truly outstanding citizens We have transfer once subway line we know We're fully capable of sending special liberty letters post-offs Indeed they even experienced love again Sometimes is much 75% even 85 Time passed with shocking spirits. Soon the boy was 32, they were 30. One beautiful April morning, said, We've got the coffee to start the day before the clock in the must-ease. By the girl and ten years in the special river line, was walking through the must-ease. Both along the same year in that street are beautiful. They passed each other. Very central the street. Thank you, CHOOSE, something different, He's felt his grip relax, She's one of the first워 from me, She used to be one of her centre components here. The girl of the memories frothy deep, hadと he got so lonesy, or she had to trust herself. Without a word, it has to change. He's appearing in the crowd. He said, story. That's... that. The rookie Mark only showed stories in his collection of stories. He's looking down at the scenes. He's looking down at the scenes. and can be mentioned, but actually, in sum.
