At least from here I think. I'm not at worrying about all the things I'm supposed to be doing. I want to get here. My dad used to work days and weekends and nights when I was a kid. Now, some Saturdays, he calls me up. I'm at the office. He's at the office. I'm at the office. I believe it's very realistic to think about my job. much I'm producing this radio shows on right here at Rewisnington. I realized that every week is I come to grips with the fact that having to actually do the show, you go through the five stages that Elizabeth Coupa Ross says she goes through to come to grips with death. You remember the stages? It's an IEL, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. That was the first thing I realized. Second thing I realized was that, I have any feelings? I'm spending way too much time at my job. No, I'm not your type of needle. I'm gonna talk to you. I showed it today. It's all about you. Beer If you work too hard, you spend too many hours, you spend too many hours thinking about work. And if  the job, spend too many useless hours thinking about that. Today's show, the job that takes over your life. Back one, I got you in a few sick people until it comes to believe that he is sick, back two, some teenagers who think they're signing up to be in a play, find out they're joining a sort of cult instead. Act 3. Guys, you get thrown in the slamer, it's gonna be because they don't want to work in unsafe conditions. I've been going to the woods for a while. At one, I was hired to interview men and women in the state of Utah who received Medicaid support for treatment of mental illnesses, generally diagnosed as schizophrenia. I was a carrier who's had it on again often in career as a radio reporter in southern city. He was hired for this interviewing job because the director... to research project. I heard some of his radio stories and thought he was a good interviewer. Somebody knew I'd always. They taught Scott how to administer this test which measured mental health is 100 questions each of which was scored in the scale of 1 to 7. Took an hour to give the test. Scott was paid $30 for each test again. People would give the test too. Got five times. I had little understanding of schizophrenia before I began and I have little more understanding now. I took the job. because I had no other to put the job because I just quit my steady job, my professional job, after realizing that what I wore more than anything was to put my boss on the floor and stand on his throat and watching gag. Then my wife moved out, took the kids and everything. She said, I thought about it, I really think it's the best thing for me this time in my life. And so I took the job in reviewing schizophrenia clinics because it was offered to me because it was all there seemed to be. And it seemed somehow predest, harmic response that could not be a boy. It would only be temporary, something to get through the sun. And I was told that they needed someone willing to drive around the state through the small tear. Searching out individuals who were off in transit, found a hide. I  to drive. sight ON. the trap and I  the idea of pursuit. So I took the job and did the job. My life will never be the same. The patient is 21 years old and has lived with his parents since his discharge from the army. He has no friends, no recreational activities, and no social life. He spends his time writing and reading, but these activities do not give him any pleasure. He has lost weight, as general anxiety and loss of libido, and occasional feelings of unreality. He is worried about his unpredictable behavior. For example, getting down on all borders and chewing the grass, because he was thinking what it would be  to be a cow. The patient is 25 years old and believes that she is the devil and therefore responsible for all the evil in the world. She's knocked it out of her house for seven days and only comes down from the room for meals. A few days ago her mother walked into her room and found her crying. She asked her mother what was the most painful punishment that one human being could inflict upon another. The mother tried to get the reason for this question and her daughter mumbled something about the devil. having to be punished for the better for the humanity, something about having to die for his sins. When the mother asked her if she still thought she was the devil, she answered, let's not get into that again. It only upsets you. You don't believe me anyway. Even when the evidence is all around, claim for you to see. The people in the universe are also sad. so lonely with such thin souls,  ghosts and demons have invaded their hearts, or sucking their souls dry. A person's soul should be  an ocean, but it's a frenic soul as I could pull a rain and a parking lot. They suffer, and they are completely alone in their suffering. There's nothing I can do, nothing anyone can do to bring them back. I come home at night and cry. I sob  a three-year-old. Today, halfway through an interview with a man into Woola, he says, I have a crystal in my pouch. Do you want to see it? I say, okay, and he takes it out. A normal crystal, the size of a large paperclip. And he says, I can look through this and it will tell me whether you're a good person or a bad person. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look through it or not? My first thought is to say, do you want to go on with the interview? Maybe when we're done, you can look through the crystal. But then, I realized that he's really asking me to take his test, just  I'm asking him to take my. I come into his house, I ask him very personal questions, and I expect him to answer honestly, and why shoot him. So, I say, okay, go ahead, and he puts the crystal up to his eye. Turns it clockwise and counterclockwise, back and forth, squinty, looking me up and there. And he says, I can't tell for sure. I'm going to have to read you my. Here, take my hand. He holds out his right hand with a crystal-rest in her palm. I take his hand and he puts his left hand over my hand, and squeezes it tight, and shakes it, and goes into a small spasm. Then he lets go, and sort of sits back  he's exhausted. He asked me if I felt anything, and I say, well, maybe you're little, and he says, I sent you a message, I put it in your mind. I told you what is wrong with me. I'm not supposed to figure out what's wrong with these people. I'm just supposed to ask the questions and score the answers for more into seven. This is partly because I'm not a doctor and might get something going that I wouldn't have had a contain, but it's mainly because my supervisors weren't cleaned out of. They weren't all the people asking the questions to be doing it the same way. I'm not supposed to give a motion or I'm not supposed to let the... patient get emotional. The therapy part of the county mental health system is in another department. I wouldn't even know what number to call, and I've been told more than once not to worry about it. I should never have let him take the crystal out of his pouch. At your other round I'll day trying to find a Navajo man. He lives very close to the four cross where you call a Colorado. Mexico and Arizona me. It's all dirt roads. The house every five miles or so. No addresses, no fun. I stop at every house and knock on the door. But even nobody's home, or nobody will answer. I flagged down every car that passes and asked directions. And the people offer complicated directions that I follow is best as possible. Sometimes driving for 20 or 30 miles. But it's always the wrong place. Nobody's home, but it just isn't a house. scared off. Do I be in a round? I think about how I have some of the same problems as the people I interviewed. I'm angry, depressed, crumbed, paranoid delusions, and I worry a lot. Up to now, I thought these were common problems, and that I was more or less able to control. But now, I don't know. I feel  I'm just faking it. Eventually, late me after now, I find the man, or at least I think he's the man. I'm a third of the way through the test before I realize he's not the right guy. When was your last visit to a mental health clinic? I don't go to a clinic. When did you last see a doctor? I don't have a doctor. Do you blame yourself or anything you've done or not done? No. Do you think most of the carpentine users are the best? No. Have you heard voices or other things that weren't there or that other people couldn't hear or seen things that weren't there? And he says, I think you want to talk to my son. And I ask him what his son's name is and he says, same as mine. I come back the next morning and can interview the son in the kitchen. They may coffee for him, you're an appropriate campster. His house has no electricity. The sun is 19 years old, a good looking kid, tall, healthy, says he used to run cross-country in high school. He seems to be fine, but as I go through the questions he starts to fix his eyes on my, a de-rap almost if not exterred, straight in my head,  he's trying to pull me in and trap me. I try to look back to look just as deeply into his mind, but it's  looking into a kid. He says he hears voices, satanic voices, and that he worries a lot about issues that they're not the right kind, not the kind he sees on MTV. I can't tell if he's sick or if he's just trying to torture me. And I drive away thinking, I don't know anything about this disease, that I know even less than when I started. I spent two days driving around and I made 30 bucks, and I feel really, really tired. The house is dark as all the windows have any curtains pulled nearly shut. The curtains over the big picture window in the living room are open just a bit, and the light cuts through  a laser beam hits the redshag carpet, throwing up small dust particles, cigarette ash. Two feet away from the light near the television is a slice of pizza line upside down in the heart. I'm interviewing the woman from mother and her teenage daughters on the phone talking to a boy for a rather a series of boyfriends who call, call, and all of them wanted to go out right now, but her mother won't let her. She's trying to answer my questions, trying to concentrate and be polite, but she's mainly listening to what her daughter is saying on the phone and we'll suddenly switch. from saying, no, no, I've been feeling sorry. I haven't had a relapse of marts to screaming out. Is that John? I told you never to talk to him again. Or, who is it? Is it a boy? You can't go out. Tell him he has to come over here. I can't stop looking at the slice of pizza on the carpet. I keep looking at the slice of pizza because it's the only clue that the woman is sick. I mean, she has a teenage daughter and a dirty house. Maybe she shouldn't try to wear makeup to bed. But these are not... necessarily symptoms of schizophrenia, she seems to be far just one out. Until I get to the question, if you've been worrying a lot, and she says yes, she has, she's been worrying a lot, that the elders of the church, the Mormon church, will take her daughter away from her. And I ask her why, and she says, because she stopped taking her medication, I ask her, why did you stop taking your medication? And she says that the only reason she can't exist is because she stopped. her bishop that she was visited by the Archangel Gabriel and that she had sex with. And then she was also visited by the Archangel Michael and that she had sex with both of them at once and that they'd ravished her almost every night. So her bishop made her go to a doctor and the doctor gave her some pills and she took the pills and the angel stopped coming. The bishop and the elders had told her that if she had sex with any more angels, they take her daughter away. So yeah. her again why she stopped taking her medication and she says, I'm lonely, I missed the, I walked into combat. Today in a restaurant eating lunch between interviews, I decided to take the test. I answered the questions and scored myself appropriately and at some point I realized that I wasn't doing so. So I decided not to even add up the points, because then I'd be left with this score, and I'd never forget it. Followed a writer report on myself, and would sound something  this. The patient is 36 years old, and lives alone since his wife left him three weeks ago. She took the kids, and all the silverware except for a large knife and a bowl and a coffee cup. The patient admits that a living may have had something to do with the fact that, without. He completely guided the house, throughout all the walls and seeing each other laugh and plastered right down to the stud. He says he did this in order to live  a primitive. When asked if he was successful, he says it was the first step in the right direction. The patient is a 36-year-old man who lives alone since his wife and children left in two months ago. He says there's a darkness that separates him from other people, a heavy darkness, by looking at a person from the bottom of a well. He believes that if he could say the right words, then the darkness would go away. He says he sometimes knows the right words, but cannot say that. Other times, he can't even think of the words to say. Animals are aẫnable inches in their lives. Side-d систему. Patientism is. There's 36 years old and lives alone since his wife and children left him three months ago. Last week, he went fishing in the sand marks and now believes that there's no better fisherman than himself. He says, I can't tell you about it because talking about fishing is silly,  farting and tap dancing at the same time. All I can say is I walk around in the water, and I know the instant official jump for the fly. I've had opened their stomachs and squeeze out the bugs in my hand. he, how it all gets digested, even the exoskeleton and wings. He says he was sick before, but now he's okay, and that it was the fly rod, just holding the rod in his hand, they cured him. His house is clean, the electricity is on, the walls have been sheetrocked and painted white. He says, I'll have to ask her, Baker, and maybe she'll come back. That's got carrier from Salt Lake City. Years after writing that story, it is now in print in a collection of Scott's work, which comes out in March, called Running After Annel Up, coming up more stories about jobs that take over your life. It's big jobs getting by, now it's in a while, but I've been... I'm working man, thank you all my life, I don't keep on working. Long as my two hands are 50 years. I'll drink my favorite tamper, sing a little bit of these work and man blue. Act 2. Try. Chris is this American life of my reclass. And , a couple weeks ago, coming out of the blue bird. The blue bird. or here in the Clyburn street, carbonate, and we'll just go to them. I was just with my friend Teresa, and we're coming out of the bar and we've honking this group of maybe 40 people. That comes, skip it. I mean, that's a word you don't really use your often to describe people, adults, and fun people, but they were more or less skipping down the street, chattering sort of half walking, half running. And they greet us joyously. And look us in the eye and they surround us and they see curious and happy with the kind of eyes. It seems  a group of three or four dozen people who are in love in love all of them Turns out it's the cast of hair Which is in town or wasn't down then these are mostly college kids from Cal State for what ten You've been drafted into this road company of the show grown long hair one woman tells me I have never felt so strongly about love and peace and the war But not just in a play they said, they are in a mission. A mission. Disrespect power and some love. And they say things , I think that it's six we need to get messages. Love, peace and freedom. Because without a small group of people, I can hold on to those old values, we're in major trouble. The idea is we have to live the lives so that we can convince you that that life is real. The idea is we have to live the lives of people. Yes. Now we're in matching necklaces with these little Native American stones, I'm going to signifying that the wrong members are tribe, they call the Potawanami tribe. They all live together in a dorm. And a couple days after this, Peter Kahnie, from the staff of our video, started to visit that dorm. To see just how much this job being in this play, they take note of their lives. When I arrived at the dorm, it's 130 in the afternoon. And most of the tribe is just getting up bed. The show's choreographers playing. prints on a boom box in the second floor lobby to wake everyone up. About six people dance and late risers and towels and boxes, we've the way around them on their way to the showers. Some of them stop for hooks. I call her one for questioning. So are you a happy member of the tribe? Oh, extremely happy. Extremely happy. I can't I've never been happier. Ever. What is the tribe do for you? Take me so much love. Love that I've never. I was more in my entire life. It's so scary because I called my mom on Sunday and I told her that this has been really life changing and I really scared her. But I mean, it's just me so bright. I wish you can have ran a really deep. I hear this maybe a dozen times or hang out with the tribe. Fill a syvee and enthusiastic member of the tribe. Listen to me in my interview with E-friend and then she jumps in. Have a good day. Do you differentiate the... So, I know hair from the tribe or I mean, is this just a production that, , because we're going to go on, we're all going to play other roles and everything. I mean, true, this is such a life of changing experience for me as well, but in, , when you get down to it, we are actors. We are paid to play this role. Show is so different though. True. It's, I will never be as close to other actors in them. to the school. The original producer of hair, Michael Butler, traveled the country for two years looking for a college production of the show that he could turn into a national touring company. He chose this group because on stage in some undefinedable way, they seem  a real tribe. They have the spirit of a real tribe even if they aren't the greatest singers and dancers. And in the early days of rehearsals for the National Tour, they had encounter sessions where it was drilled into them that this is more than just a show, that this is more than just a business that they really are. are tried. But of course it is a business. People have jobs to do. They have to be able to sing and act and show up on time. And when the producers take the show on the road, they'll face a business problem. There's only enough money to bring about 25 of the customers, downsizing from 38. Pills Ivy says it'd be understandable if it shows the best singers and performance. There are people who can't sing in the show. There are people who can't hold pitch. There are people who can't act. There are people who can't dance. If we were to audition for the show, if in New York, Michael Butler wanted to hold auditions for the world tour of hair. There are not a lot of people in this cast who would be in that show. This sounds common sense, but within the world of this time, it's heresy. They've been told that everyone belongs in the tribe, but they believe in it in work hard. A few cast members stand and listen to fillest say this, their arms crossed. And then they come... Can I play the end one for next? I've been. Sure. Okay, because yeah, I don't want anything negative to be. Oh no. Yeah. But  what? We've got more heart and soul than any of these cast put together in our shows actually being credible. And I know I would never would have probably gotten a chance with the Madam Storm singer. But with my with my dedication to my heart and soul involved in the show, it's been life changing. And it's a lot, it's a lot more than that. So as one of those people who cannot really shoot. not a vocal person, but she is a great and every bit of part of the show as you and I are. When Phyllis Ivy responds, she's trembling. I didn't want to appear  that. However, I mean, we've talked about tribe and we've talked about how we all bring in individual I walked downstairs and I'm surprised to see how quickly word spreads that I saw them disagree. They want me to believe we get lost. When I go into the red room, some of the guys are likeweeps to my momy. playing ping pong. A cast member comes looking for Nathan, one of the de facto leaders of the tribe. Yay. Yay, I'm sorry, right there. You gotta talk to me. You gotta talk to me. Guys, 10 for a round. There's a herred conversation around the corner. Nathan returns with speech to make to me. I know that everybody wants the past, or the show, it's , if it goes on with the 38 people we have now, great, . But if not, those people are going to obviously go through a lot of jay and all herper, then. Just say Tokyo, But I think that their belief in the show is going to continue to say, , to send us energy and vibes and say, we're still loving you guys. We want you to do the best that you can. Nathan's not just spinning me, who believes this, he's completely sincere. Everyone in this group, Nathan at 21, is the one everyone says is a real hippie. Nathan dressed  a hippie, who looked  a hippie, even before he got a part in here. And from nine months now, he's been a peacekeeper in the group. Someone who's earnestness and belief in getting a lot, there's nothing I can do with about five years, and you can see those people strong people experience. You can see them and think about themselves. Would you imagine that they would be watching from physical age? Yeah. But they're really good at ants with little falling. So, what would you imagine? First with something I thought it would be about to put my soul into the cage. and taking care of each other. It's help keep group going. But now while Nathan talks about love holding the cast together, even when 13 people might get cut. One of the guys in the room, ride, snorts and mothers under his breath, and then he lays into Nathan. It's bullsh** to say that you're not going to have animosity, and that you'd be sending good vibes. I'm sending good vibes, yeah. It's not giving me that for you, but wouldn't you be happy? I mean, if I were not going to know there's going to be sending good vibes, but they don't get to go. Are you going to go on the tour? Probably not. I would love to then. I got it. I opted. get down on my hands and eat. Hey, glare. Let me go. What about you? No, I really want to go. And if I don't go, I'm going to be really miserable and really heaps. I'm going to be, I don't know how. Hey,  you're going to go on the other. The only guy with real long hair in a beard and they can leave him here, give me a break. An intentionally over the course of nine months, the tribe has revived another part of 60s communal living along the peace and love. It's resentment, impeded of mis, and paranoia. I was taking the back when I asked Derek and innocent question , what's the tribe ? And he responded this way. Whoever doesn't, a heirs to point, I'm telling you this, right? Whoever doesn't, what would be part of why would be, shouldn't be part of why would be, and he really should be in the part of why would be. drive which will happen if you cannot be potter-wired me walk. If you don't want to be a try, get out. You're  what we do, get out. So where we are and if you think that you can stay in and still want to put a monkey wrench in our action, you will not. We will put you out. We invite you in and we ask you to leave. I did those interviews a few weeks ago. From now the cast is off tour, most of them are at school. No decisions have been made yet about moving tour in the spring, and so everyone's still getting hot. When they run into each other at school though, members of the tribe still hug each up, just  they always have. And another student said it in reason, when you guys are going to cut out all that love for her. I'm just dying to be a legend, I'm just dying to be a legend. I'm just dying to be a legend. I'm just dying to be a legend. Well, coming up guys, you get thrown in jail because they refuse to work in conditions to get 320 of their co-workers blown up. That's a minute. Perseve Global Gothic International went out program continues. This American life, I'm Eric Glass. Each week, of course, we bring you a variety of stories around some theme, stays themed. The job that takes over your life. We're going to wrap this broadcast to bring you this important bulletin from the United Press. Flash, Washington, a White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Stay tuned to WOR for a further development, which we broadcast immediately as received. After Pearl Harbor, the Navy opened two blacks for the first time. Whether this is Then it sent out on ships, one large group of African American men found the south station in one of the least desirable dumps. It was literally a dump, an ammo dump. Called Port Chicago. This is just not a San Francisco now the place is called Concord Naval Weapons Station. Their job was to load ammunition onto ships, and conditions were so unsafe that it was the site of the worst state-side disaster of the war. On July 17, 1944, two ships blew up, killing 320 men, and rocking all of San Francisco took him to many people felt was just an earthquake. A court of inquiry blamed the sailors it concluded, quote, the colored and listed personnel are neither temperamentally nor intellectually capable handling high explosives. Well, when survivors ordered right back to work, the guys who had survived the whole thing, they was at right back to go to a go back to work, under the same conditions, 50 of them refused, and they were sentenced to up to 15 years of heart labor. Over the year since then there have been many attempts to clear their names, including in 19. 44 by the principle rights of 23 good martial, Dan Kawasan spoke with five survivors of the incident about what really happened at Kuchkago. We sent everything out of this from 33 the rifle codded this all the way up to 2000 palm, lot buses we call them. My top basically was the low ammunition with crew which were in the hole in the ship. you be down in the hole. Here come the big bombs and things coming down the wrap with a head built. But sometimes they let it come down to face. And they hit together and they made a loud noise. You hear this all day long? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And that was almost Tia, almost Tia. Yeah, you almost have a heart attack. And so will you say asking sometimes, say, Did any danger this ammunition explode? They said, oh no, don't worry about this thing. It's not live. Say, don't have no depth in the Arizona. You was not trained alone in ammunition. We would take ammunition, we take a Cuba. We had to go so high. We would take a crew band, push our ammunition up. They'd go to the river. and I'll expose God in every dead lady. You believe it? Well, airplanes fly across the land and steam. Everybody find them but a negro  me. Uncle Sam said, your face is on the ground. When I fly my airplanes, don't want no negro round. The same thing for the Navy and ships go to sea. All they got is a miss-boys job for me, Uncle Samson. Keep all your evils on me. I ain't gonna let you shoot my big Navy gun. You didn't have a lot of white people that just saw. We only had basically one office and he would be doing the first five. Well, , the white also didn't have much to do with us, no more, and to stand around and supervise and see that we. Low then. I am nation. He was told that so much we had to be dead at night. We had to be in this night. He was a rush rush. And the very man is push, the very arms is pushed in man to move lower than the which is the truth. As fast as they come into it. But we knew them about it. 100 dollars in. So that my division won. more in the US. It's one of what put up with that there. Division of Locielman, those particular ships, on that particular day. That day, later, we came to the shipyard. Frequently, the urgent need for ammunition forced the depot to load two ships at the same time at the same pier. So it was on the night of July 17, 1944. 檫 – Lock Win Alzheimer's Theory, and the. The EA Brian were more at the Naval Magazine, Korkhikako. 16 cars of ammunition and bombs were spotted on the pier beside the Kwanalt victory, as the ship rigged to load. Brian had been loading day and night for more than three days. 3.5 million pounds of explosives were aboard, or waiting nearby on the pier. Everything was normal. Until 10.19. It was a Monday. A heart you lied. day. And for some reason the day was kind of a day that I felt a grace of boredom. And I don't know why. Glater on a dinner. Two lights went out of the clock. We were all doing to the touch. I had pimples, , still being a teenager. So nightly I went and then tied myself up and put on not a zimmer. And... I got back to my locker, put my gear away, said my prayers and leaped up. I had a top rack, leaped up in the rack, and here comes the voicels and the comms system again. Lights out quite about the back. I've landed with my hands behind my ear, looking out the sky. And at that time I guess, a few minutes after I got out. This guy lives up, and it's just  the sea rolls. for things to break, you see all the buildings for a second. Shortly after that, here come the second explosion, feeling this guy with all kinds of lights and colors, light and the fourth of your life, celebration. Thank you, the concussion. The concussion blew in the woods, blew in my body. I left home, I'm here later. Thanks, hear. Thanks, show us. Come here, man. That was the first explosion. The second was... of the consecutive years. That lived to be on the view of the world. All hell broke rules of just a lot of confusion because glass was everywhere. Men were just in fear and some ran all out there there. Be a feet. Short. It was just bedlam. The people down, screaming and yelling, the yellow glass of berries. It's coming down. So... I myself scuffed a lot of tough for the outside and when they would know all the exposure then I crawled out but then I noticed that I didn't could seek clearly and that's when I first realized them that I was hurt and I called him a buddy. Hey, Moss, come and get me take me to the sick bay and then somebody else hop up with a sick bay is been blown up. What I can't say, then few people outside young volunteers. to announce the talks I'm up to, guys. So yeah, I would get bonnet here. He asked me, said, did you see Percy? Get out of the barracks. I mean, you're recognized me. He was my squad leader. Because my face was so filled with cuts. The left eye was last rated so badly that that was removed that night. And the right eye was last rated. And so, I can't support that. He's going to die eventually and lost. society in that too, so that was the beginning of the end. And causing it to be on my personal. In a Pacific war, American battleships cruisers in destroyers shall grow on island on Sunday for the second straight day. Here at home officials say that 337 persons, the non-dad are missing and presumed dead more than 300 others injured as the result of last night's explosion of two ammunition ships at Port Chicago and upper sentences go bad. Not general electric. We think that we're not told the same thing, but that's what it was . It's  some kind of problems over the roof. It didn't look  it was an explosion from the ceiling. It looked  a plain command. This is bombardment, please. In the Waterfront Pyrex and Administration area, buildings humbled by cardboard. Roofed blown off, walls gone. In the vicinity of the loading fares, total destruction. Both ships broken twisted hawks. That was a shocking thing. The sea those ships tore up and and seeing I was standing watch over all those dead bodies. I had just been watching with it. That would my dude. And you couldn't tear one from others. Meanwhile, the Court of Inbury was collecting testimony and exhibits. Experts and all fields were called in to study the area. The cause of the explosion could not be fixed with certainty, but it was suspected that a depth charge was accidentally detonated. I knew what it was, of which we were expecting at all time. We were at that very mind, and one day the stiffness of a blow. We felt  we were getting a road to you. Well, we were the one that was doing. they did not worry. Me was the one that fooled with damn and nation. So why shouldn't you have an evil option to get away to get your new cell? But they didn't happen. I think I was in hospital maybe a week and I think that they have to turn after we want to go to work. I still was pan stopped. Peace. But this is still everything. So we were blind about that parents. They were dead those who we had to do it. But then they say, I was marching on the outside, I caught Kiddish. Something  the whole earth, the earth, the west, right left, left, left, two, two, or left, right, left. and leave it to him to look for it. If we had calmed down, we would have gone to the dark. We would have gone to the dark. Because calmed down, we were going to the darks. And the darks went to the darks. It gave us all the murder, we were too low-down in the night. Just all the murder we... In our soul, we were... I am... absolutely afraid. Which I will. I'm afraid to learn him is you step over there. Then he called another one of my thoughts. Thank you to them to act in the same vein. You step over there. And when they entered the deal with all that I think just about all of his step over there. Then they hadn't given them their experience with our responsibility. He told us he said, well one thing I want to tell you. that you could be charged with new days if you don't go back to work. And he explained at that time that when you see the school back to work, you could have a shot. That was a key. When he said you could be shot, then that fellow went to mum. , a lot of people they phrased at that. From my upbringing. Stop, . The white man threatens to hate you. He would do it as first legal chance. It's a terrible plan and it's a good promise to say to me. So I believe that damn legal chance to use it. So I'm afraid. So I'm not going to give a chance to kill me. I'll go back to her. But then fifth day I was decided that we wasn't going to go back to work and we don't get shot. We decided to shoot. because we wasn't going to go back and go home. That's when we were arrested. I would say a rest of the COVID-19 all shipped to things straight down. So to stocking. Then we found out that we were charging you. We didn't commit no mutin' there. We didn't take over no ship. We didn't take over base. We had no weapons. We didn't even have a peer. We didn't even have a peer. We only refuse to go back and work. Now how could that be? I don't know about me. I just knew that I didn't want to work on the same conditions. I did work. And advanced in chess, same thing happening again. Well the moon is just  the thing. that is, it's cutting dry. We all sit over here, all white officers over here. We went now to say anything but what they would ask us. It was gives me a choice. I expected the greatest things to try and read. Then I'd love to know what the answer is, it should be in the name of the well-being. It is an easy answer and I think... was eight years. I had twelve years in some days sixteen. I don't know, I don't know whether I just, I don't remember crying, but I just seemed  it was something that would happen in after the trial. You have to sit in the trap a few days and he's, you see what was going down. 7pm, eastern wartime, locked up to 40. The Japanese have accepted our terms to fully. That's the word we've just received from the White House in Washington. This latest entitlement is the end of the Second World War. The United Nations on land on the sea in the air, until the four corners of the earth are United and are victorious. One war in it, as they had suspended our sentence, they had releases, yet did we get it. his judge, my discharge from Navy, to be the meat for receiving jobs, and I would have received that this was a business. And, granted, it burned in me as a person incapable of following orders. I used to couldn't talk about it because it was pretty. It was pretty inside. You didn't want to experience the know that you was in a certain way. I would need me. You didn't want people to think that you, , , you didn't your country or something that you do something  that. Still on this country, we knew about it. Not even to fill that work with, I didn't talk with it with my wife or children. Here with time I would bring it up or even think about it, because I got up. I hate feeling just about to happen. I just hate it. Tell the priest and the hate was built up. It's staving me. He was hate staving me. He can really destroy a person. I could have been a better father. I'd be a stranger than he. I wouldn't have abused him, but I didn't talk about things I had to do. I would react nicely. Things I think I could have did better. We can think of weak words he wrote. Because we stood up for our right. We stood up because we knew that we did not commit new things. I think it was right. on how to roll the real quick, it would write. I was fighting for something. I have no love. There's no good for the name, I don't know. But things were not right. It was my desire to make things right. I've never thought shame, but the shame was me. I did it. thought was best and I did it in best way I knew how. Yeah. No way back, you'll know seeing  it in 50 years and it still hanged over 70 years. If you asked me I think democracy is fine, I mean democracy without a color line.
