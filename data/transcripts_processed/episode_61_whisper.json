  "text": "From P.R.I. Public Radio International. From P.R.I. Public Radio Public Radio Public Radio International. From the National Public Radio International. What could be more than a person who sees something that we've done before? Dreams they could do it. Go to F.R.F.R. Let's begin today with a woman who dreams of directing play. In the small town where she lives, college town, somewhere below the misunderstandings. Here's the map of the city. how much will remain for our purposes today? I mean, I don't know she had ever direct on and she claimed to have act and it was never really quite clear just what her credentials were. But she managed to convince the local food department of this college that she should direct a production of theater. He was in the 10th grade in 1973. Jack hit saw and production. And  everybody else, you heard about food. for slowly but surely  you began to hear sort of rumors about this production. For example another day it spent a lot of money renting these flying apparatus out of VR and apparently they're only up there's  one company in a handful of these apparatus is that it get them was a major coup. This is a story not just a mediocre play or a terrible play. What do I talk about that to it's not even a story that I'm playing. This is a story that the Fiesta, and about that makes Fiesta. And one ingredient of many Fiesta is that great, massive, heart-wrenching chaos and failure are more likely to occur when great ambitions come to life, when plans are big, expectations break, hopes at their highest. And what you have to understand is that everybody in the sort of communities understood that there were there was certainly a sort of air of everyone sort of reaching. beyond the earth grass. Every actor was sort of in a role. It was just a little too big for them. Every aspect of set crew and in a room where it sort of comes around. There was a huge crew that was lots of things we needed. But this in fact is one of the criteria for greatness. Is that everyone is just about to reach just beyond the grass because that that is when greatness can occur. That's right. That's right. And maybe greatness could occur. Well, today on our program, what happens when greatness does not occur? What happens in fact when humble leads to error leads to mishat and before that you have left the realm of ordinary mistake and chaos and you have entered into the more serial specialized realm of the Asco. Today's show, the Asco's a philosophical inquiry. Perhaps the first ever as far as we know into what makes of the answer what takes an ordinary lives that extra distance into the answer. The first ever ever as far as we know into what makes of the answer is the last ever as far as we know into what makes of the answer. Probably be easy to target this in our life. Today's program in 4X, back one. night back to the Ascoan Club, village, broadening bus, and I can take power and brass call it an end-sum oil. Next, actually, car was true story, about putting in pure show cartop on the air in this car and let not just, hundreds of angry letters and listeners, not just to a protest rally, not just to a monthly newsletter devoted to the scandal, but eventually the state audit and state hearings by the legislature. That's it for. Yes, this is of course we did this well. We begin our show with this true fable, either pair, in act one. Open the mirror. Opening outcomes and , almost everybody in the area, , 10 mile radius of this theater. No somebody in this production, so the place is pretty much part. And I don't know if you remember the opening, mom of Peter Pinnon, but it's the three little kids sleeping in the bed. And Peter Pinnon was fine in the window. And in this industry. a few production. There's a big bad vote for kids in and off to the left, however, is a big youth wardrobe, large window there, and a little beer, Peter Pan comes in and has a little speech where he says,  anybody can fly, why? Just a little writing desk or a vlog. And Peter Pan sort of sprinkles his writing desk here and sure enough, the kids sort of suddenly just lurch into the air. It becomes clear right away that the people that they've hired to run these flying apparatus are really quite clear on how they actually work. So instead of the kids sort of sailing gracefully to the throat, they start a hang in the air when poppins, they're sort of dang there. They're getting jerked up and injured too, or back and forth. And then sometimes you just stationary, you're just just hanging there a little bit, a spider. And then a several of you start to sort of circumscribe these circles in the air where it's clear that the people running the machines have just sort of set them off of these kind of oval courses that spiral farther and farther out. And if you're sitting in the audience, it was clearly a sense of fear on the faces of these people. Of the act, the actors actually eat. you could sense their lack of confidence in the people running the machine back. So the way it ends and the audience reaction to this point is just, are they laughing? No one is laughing. Everyone, this is one of the great things about audiences, especially in the line. Is it very forgiving? They want the show to work. And so everyone who's sort of ripping their chair a little tight. , we'll feel for them. , they're up there. They're embarrassing. So it's for us, , we identified that. We are become them. And so the audience, I think, was very deep and very understanding this moment. But there was one moment that in this first opening scene and kind of put the audience on notice. And that's when as the kids are jerking up and down, swing it back and forth and sort of going around in these ovals, at one point, the little, the little one, the little boy is sort of being slung around a little too. Yes. Oh, a little too hard. Oh yes, the least master resist with every the machinery is doing to it. Right. Okay, so I add. And so he's flying around the circle. And the audience sort of sees this calming and there's a real sense of pain and gripping of the chair and white knuckleness as the kid suddenly does. Just a black into the wardrobe. I mean, and it's clearly a part, . And he comes off of it sort of, , a little. days. Then of course he's jerked up in the air a little bit and often a little too high so there he suddenly sort of in the working. He sort of left the stage itself. He's now up there with the lights. I don't know if I need to sort of... Suddenly, he just plumb it back down to the stage and be caught up just before he hit the floor and... And... It was... It was fun to watch because as you can tell, it's a... It's an incredibly funny moment. But  I say the audience is still in this very forgiving mode and no one said it work. We just all sat there so holding our breath and there's a weird tension Being in the audience thinking oh oh my goodness they have gotten off the very bad start. Oh this this is not good Right we feel May I just interrupt just tomorrow just to see now now at this point because after all we are not just Join if you're together in the radio you're tired today to laugh at the foibles of the unfortunate. No, no, no, we go to enumerate the qualities of the S. Go. At this point, we are not yet in the territory of the S. No, no, because, ,  I say, audiences are forgiving and they, , one or two mistakes, even big ones  this, they're going to let that ride. They say, or we did. We were very good. And so we are not yet at the S. Go, we are at a sort of normal level of mishab. Bright. What happens immediately after this? They disappeared in every other way. If you remember the stage goes dark and then on the lights come up, there's Captain Huff. He's giving. It's the first opening silhouette, a about how evil he is, what a menace is. , arms, people, and these children, it's all that means stuff. So Captain Huff is out there. He looks great. Great, it's going to be a big old fat asser. And it's a great hook with boots and everything. And people are feeling more comfortable, something's happening. It's a good sign. It's a good sign. He's in charge. He's got a bad mustache. He is certainly equal. Yes. And audiences totally in his pocket. He's speaking away just recently and going on and on about how bad he is. And then at a certain point, as he gestures his hook and the entire black casing up to it. and his elbow, slings off of his hand, and flies into the audience. And punches an old lady in the gut. And now he is bad. He is very bad. He had the worst I'd live I've ever heard. I mean, what do you say at that point? Because of course his hand is now naked. He exposed to the audience. And at the moment for any actor. Very, very. The brain. I'm a subject character. that you have, your name is Captain Huss. Literally, all that's going to happen for the rest of the shows, people are going to refer to you by that book. Your entire motivation as a character is the fact that you're is that your arm was eaten off by an alligator, and that you have to have the entire plot, and you have a plot stems from that. Right. And now suddenly, you have no heart. In fact, you have five fingers on a hand. Has it a miracle by the word? That's the note said, , they just don't make notes  they used to. That was actually the other level. I will never forget. Then the lights come up. We are in Never Never. In Act 2. Yeah, this is  Act 2. And Captain Huckman has stood in front of the set. Didn't know what to see. She. Now the lights come up and it's supposed to be very dramatic. The rumors of all these cruel and anything that we think is going on in all this distraction. All worked towards this one. Because when the lights came up, he was never never let him go. It was a psyched evidence set. It was paper-misshing, mushrooms everywhere, different sizes. It was absolutely wonderful in surreal. Wow. And there's nobody there and then from. The upper rasters of stage right suddenly the kids and Peter Pan here. Fine. Flying. They're flying. , and they're landing. They're landing occurs rather rapidly at an angle of about 45 degrees to the stage. They come down basically , I don't know, lead sinkers on a line and crash to the floor. , and then are sort of just dragged across the floor. mobs and wipe out all of the mushrooms. And so now we arrived at a turning point in our fiasque. Yeah, yeah, it's clear now that the audience is giving away something has been lost. Some sense of declam that little. bit of forgiveness has for the actors and empathy and empathy. It's beginning to dissipate. Well, there was a split in the audience. They were the sort of the younger people who were the least forgiven. They started to go first. Okay, so the high school students, , couple of college students, maybe. They started to laugh out loud. I'm the honest man. I met a been one of those first people. I was in it. It was your prestige for these times. But then whatever restraint that the audience had, it just event. Because there were a number of things that happened. Rick's Session, and so it's made it impossible to hold any sense in the form. Which, for example, Tinkerbell appears for the first time. And Tinkerbell is essentially a light bulb on extension. And why? Yeah, and this was, , this was the direct. factors idea of life being raw, being very modern, tinkerbell is just going to be this literal light bulb day. Where is it in other productions where the do is that some of them will shine over. Shine a light or it will just be focused light. And then that can prick a light as supposed to be tinkerbell. That's right. Or something  that or nothing at all. And people will just address the invisible, , sprite. Right. Well, that did not happen. It's this bulb comes. just dangling down and sort of hangs around his naked hair  bulb just hangs around and the people are talking to it. And I think think about think of a better pattern of parents first act but it was somewhere in here that people just started laughing at this. Then another thing that happened was later on in a scene if you remember when he gets trapped. on an island. And she spawns a kite that's floating by flying by. She's supposed to grab it and attach it to her back and fly on. Right. But of course the kite is attached flying on red. And it gets closer and closer, or she's standing on the screen, and she's going to show you. But the flying apparatus people can't quite get it close enough to her to reach. So she has to step out into the water. that she's just told us, it's filled with crocodiles to grab. She finally gets the kite, and when she yanks on it, pops off the fly-short press, and the hook goes singing up into the whites, and catches. So now there is this big loop of wire hanging in front of the stage, and there's Wendy holding the kite, and she adlibs with Nashika. She deserves that on second pot, maybe I can... and with that she walked off the stage sort of motioning her arms  he would do the swim, the dance, and he had 165 since he does that at this point I mean the audience, the actors are just falling apart. They are so frightened of the audience. There are just belly laughs rolling up to the stage from the audience. People are... howling with laughter and every mistake. And now any small mistake just takes on these, these just, , it's just an ugly thing. Any instigation for laughter is just enough. And now the old people have been given it up. Everyone has quit being nice. Now there is just this frightening roar that comes from the audience. Every time this mistake. What happened at some point the audience turned and realized, but wait, I realized what's going on here. This is a fiasco. This is a fiasco. And what's really interesting about it is that once it starts to come with your audience wants to push your burger. Oh, they get hungry for more the ask. Oh, yeah. If they play preceded perfectly, they would be disappointed. Oh, it would have been a great disappointment. They're not going to just one one state gap. One more embarrassment. Now the reason they are is the chronicle of these embarrassment. This is why I have remembered this play. We're going to pull a bit deeper. The director decided that she wanted to break down the fort wall. This was cutting just the end of the process. The previous I just want to explain, when we say breaking down the fort wall, what we mean is the wall between the actors and the audience. It's a permeable but then the key point makes it. These are the 70s, but a lot of tears, basically the actors would come out into the audience. That's right. And interact with the audience and break down them all. So the idea being that you would get more in touch with the dramatic sense and the reality of what was happening. Anyway, so in this particular scene, what was going to happen was that the Indians were going to throw rope ladders down for the balcony, climb down these rope ladders into the audience, and move among the audience very simple. a scary savage way and frightens. Anyway, I knew about this scene because my friend David, who I went to high school was in it. And so, when David was climbing over the top of this balcony to climb down the road, he lost his foot and fell to the floor from the balcony. This means about 15 to 20. Oh, good, a good fall. That's horrible. Yeah, and he landed on both of his feet and was praying both of his eyes. And of course, her... world into a fetal position of began to cry. He was really rich, already. Now, to appreciate the horrible moment I'm describing, also understand that it's a Friday night, we are in a college stand. And there is a volunteer fire at an important point. In order to summon the rescuers from wherever they are, and alarm is sound, can be heard for five miles. That alarm is located right. over this theater. So the alarm goes off. Okay, this is an airing sign. It is so loud that you can put your fingers in here and it's still her. We're right under it. It can be heard for five. And a minute and then of course three minutes later, bus things through the door with theater are these , fifteen fire. Who are in boots? Hacks? They got houses? They don't know it. all they know is that they've been sent out. Right. And instead of I had to decay off the director, of course, as sort of slogged the actors, the show must go on. No matter what. No matter what. So while all of this is happening, people are sort of several people are attending to David and other people have just now decided that since the fireman here, he's going to be fine. They can start laughing. And that the audience has just completely lost. People are standing up in their seats and shouting for more. They want blood. I mean at this point people are actually injured and they want blood. Somehow that's how this entire place. What did you think about about this is the asshole? I think the thing makes me understand that the asshole. is that the piasto itself is all through the state. That is all the normal rules are off. You have to laugh the normal rules and have the audience's strategy act right. I've never seen a production. And I've never seen an audience collapse  this. See, but I want to , when you think about what people go for theaters to theater for, what kind of release people want. Me, people want an experience that would take them out of our themselves. We all want an experience that would take us out of ourselves and into another place, another reality. And it sounds  this production, even though it was a fiasco, in fact because it was a fiasco, was more successful than that than any conventional play fit fit. Well see, I would disagree with it. So I think, , the old theater critics, , the ancients were saying the reason you got the previous generation of production is to be, think they were these the easiest transport. The idea of being listed away from your animal nature, and into these higher or more spiritual realms, could be getting touch with you. greater tragic emotions, right? Of course what happened here was exact opposite. We got transported directly in touch with our animal being. Our baser cell. But  that's almost as rare, not more so than a great production. Am I busy? Up? If growing up means erf imposed Yes it might be for moral What we wanted to do. With some PS4's, all social wooded breaks down. That is, I think you're trying to create. It simply refuses to be free. The next thing is to cross the second category. Run cross the left stone. Jeff got to meet. What we wanted to do was spill boiling oil out of the heads of our enemies as they attempted to bang down gates of our village. As everyone now knows, we have... some problems. Primarily talking about problems that prevent us from doing what we wanted to do the way we had hoped for. We're asking for today is another chance. So, it's so much media attention to this boring oil issue that it's time to clear the air to create a little pressure to dismantle the system we have in place, bring the oil down off the roof. This would be mistake. Yes, there were problems last month during the physical break, but as I will note, he's a really rough. From its inception, I have been intimately involved with the boy with royal virgin, research, development, physical deployment. I also happened to be a team leader on the roof last month when we had occasion to try the system during the visit of attack, which so much has been written. First, it's the very concept of oil on the roof upset many of our villagers, granted it is exotic, but all great ideas seem strange at first. When our researchers realize we could visit. the College of 200 feet directly above our main portals. They began to see the possibilities of the greatest strategic defense system in the history of mankind. But at every turn, we've met problems that our researchers could not, despite their intelligence and intuition, have foreseen. For instance, how are we to get a 1900 pound brass called for an onto the roof? In the end, the College of the Race to the Youth by Means of a Custom Design net powered under less than ideal conditions. The retro graphs and the Nillagos plundered our village on this àcies to this time being held in cess of Gearing Kolbe. four months a sin. Colton's arrival on the roof is quite a long time. I remember it well. Stood by that new symbol of our independence, safe. A bright brass beacon to the world, we were not going to take it any. The wind carried up to us the cries of villagers being carried away by even the maxi-boss of the mean baths. But there was still, as I felt the wind in my hair, and watched this paratic procession of home furnishing for a sad one junten back. of our late gates, the new crew of Purchnam and the engine of the move. Well, there was some excitement. We began it once, we started a fire under the culture and we moved all soon to be safe. I made a mistake which I now readly admit. called down. I did not scream maniacally as was reported. I called down that it would not be long. Probably shouldn't have because it may have led some of our citizenry to lower their guard. But was a mistake. I admit. There were as we found it almost immediately. Still some bugs to be worked out of the program. For instance, they had been a fire on top of the FU Tower before and yes. aware we had to spend more time in the green water containing the blaze so that it was by the fresh high winds and towers wooden shings. The ace of to add the computer's moderate, as modernism forearm the fire could be. But throughout this relentless series of setbacks, hit-fossed rooftop fires that has been hard core of us absolutely dedicated to doing what we wanted to do to slash, scalding oil onto intruders as they pride or battered yet again. at our old damaged gates. Plus a little fire on the roof top was of no consequence of the frable attiniance that we stepped over with an easy stride. The entire, the dirty, some of us burned and cranky, no matter. We were committed. So the next day, first of all, the fire day we had an explosion in the months, and the same, sudie-cold day stood in the warm ashes high above the stream, along along with, and allowed all the intrusion steps and try it again. We need a broken impact. right now that our enemies are manifold and for racist and generally rude and persistent and we wanted to be ready. I'll tell you this. Where does one find out how seen before an enemy attack put the oil out the boil? Does anyone know? Let me assure you it is not an enemy book. Me. We're writing. We're vigil. Scuined at the horizon all day long. When we first saw the dust in the foothills, we fired our culture using wood that had elevated through the night and woven baskets. We were speaking about it here today. I can see how we sighted the steering in the pond. The orange flames it the size of the grass container, hungry, is a bit concerted with our own desperate desire for security in revenge. In the distance, I can see the faggling of visigust and marching tortoise, I can't worship you, and see you've dust in my soul. I pity you. Me and tortoise are steadfast. the racing. They seem the very incarnation of mistake. Their dreams of a day of using our friends and families in a petty arson of blue public behavior, duct who extinguished and one gorgeous wash of searingly. I was beside myself. It's important to know now. Everyone on the roof that day exhibited orderly and the fabric of their head was no wild screaming or cursing or even the kind of sarcastic chuckling you might expect. It knows about the enjoy of well deserved and long-delayed problems of the day were not attributable to inappropriate deport. My staff was good. It was when the visitors had approached closer than we could see their cool eyes and read their savage and the spell tattoos that I realized are error. That time put my hand on the smooth side of our beautiful cauldron and found it only vaguely warm lukewarm step in We had not known then what we now know we need to put the oil on sooner There's my decision and my decision alone to do what we did and that was the plural warm oil on our enemies as they milled about the front gates hammering at it with their trunchies. Now this is where my report diverges from so many of the popular accounts. We have heard it said that the warm oil served as a stimulant to the attack that followed the attack I alluded to earlier in which the criminal activities seemed to be the more animated visual at times of some of our towns people. Let me say first, I was an eyewitness. I gave you an important oil and eyewitness this descent. I am happy, proud to report that the oil hit its target with accuracy and sweetness, I could have only dreamed. We got them all. There was oil everywhere. We soaked them. We coated them. We covered them with a lustrous layer of oil. Unfortunately, as everyone knows, it was only one. Their immediate reaction was also what I hoped for. Surprise and panic. This however lasted about one second. Then, several of them looked up to my face and began waiting their fists in what I could only take as a tribute. And then, yes, and did become quite agitated a new, recommencing their assault on the weary pranks of our patchwork gates. Some said that they were on the verge of abandoning their attack before the oil was cast upon them, which I assure you is not true. As to the attack that followed, there was no different in magnitude or intensity than any ever dozens of offers have been yet. They may have seen more odd or extreme since the perpetrators would greasy and nearby more expensive and we did take every stick of furniture with the village, living the pews from the church, the chair in the great hall, and four milking steels, the last four from the daring. But I, for one, have simply tired of hearing about the slippery stain on the village steps. Yes, there's a bit of a mess. Yes, some of it's in. to be permanent. My team removed what they could with salt and tal, all this week. All I'll say now is watch your step as you come and go. My mind is a small and convenient escape for perfect weapon system. What we wanted to do is from round cross and spoke of short stories called hotel Eden. Coming up, I have a friendly little radio show about cars from the Ferris city of Boston, ended up the subject of legislative hearings in Wisconsin. Another fiasco's, that's in a minute, public radio international, way not spoken. Technology This American life from our classy treatment of public worship is deemed variety of kinds of stories on that. Today's program. Yes, though. our own inquiry into the nature of what makes the asko. And when you were left the realm of mishabstumble, you never meant to more verify realm of the asko. We were after that three problems. If you are hearing the sound of that question, now you probably have also heard these voices. You don't actually have a broken infection. You don't have couples in the apartment. You don't have a couple of the comforts. It's frequently located. You're gonna think of it. I'm gonna be throught. What's wrong? Let's see this draw. You're going to even drink gasoline out of your house. What are you going to drink out of your friends? You're going to have to. This is Karte. And though you may think of it as simply the friendly bander of Tom and Ray Malayats, it is also the single most popular hour in public radio. And this story starts simply at up with cons and public radio, and there were 14 stations in the sixth stage. So I did the one to save a few bucks. And years ago, when every other public radio station in country signed up with him. a single happy or show in public radio. It's got public radio thought. It cost money. It cost us tens of thousands of dollars. It's just a car show. You can do it on car show. So. Did you? Welcome to another hour of the bout cars. Lori Skeleton in the studio with Matt Joseph. Later in the hour we have a review of the 1995 Dodge Viper R-T10 and we stand run out of AdG2. for this before the hour is over. Stunning piece of raw brute force. I think the one word we have find was wow. Yeah, I think we will add a few others a little later. That shows us all about progress on Saturday mornings, where most of the greatest decisions are on the card top. It's not a huge article for a video. He was the correct expert. She would prompt him along asking questions that you were on, but it has. Collins went into much more technical detail about engines than the fifth. And then she started with 10 minutes. of serious automotive industry moves. General Motors announced in Los Angeles last week agreed to sell EV won the impact car which many people have seen on the actual equipment a couple years ago. It will be joined by a conversion of the STM. It was a perfectly decent solid informative hour of radio and while it was not, Sigma's popular show on public radio, the cockpit ratings had fans did great in pledge drives. That just a thought he was doing everything right. The B loner was worth. Isn't it a bit difficult? with a simple misunderstanding. With its perspective. And in this case, Manchester's process hit a completely different perspective in the show. From this perspective. Sure, we got great rating, it's a process that could be so much more. Only you were more , well, and it was probably the reason to show a public rating of a carton. They were constantly trying to get him to make his show snappier. Pastor piece, more than entertainment. I just thought they were wrong. We were all threatening. and bring in cartop, there are almost no moans, no hints, mutants, and these fundamental disagreement, 80% went to the ASCAP tower. Final, this complicated deal in the of what , by the film and the aim show, which is produced by Wisconsin Public Radio, the price of cartop to the Wisconsin Public Radio dropped from $33,000 to an affordable $10,000. The network which had thought that it did not meet, sigma's resolution. I looked over each shoulder, it's happening on 400 other radio stations, descended that maybe in fact they had been wrong. They won part talk. Joy Cardine is one of the Wisconsin Public Radio programs behind all this. The most of recent audience research that we've had showed that part talk is a program that works extremely well when it's paired with what  with Michael Delvin. And we've packed both programs do better. And we... made the recommendation that the best place to put cartoch would be non-profit and Saturday morning, followed by what you made with Michael Belt. For nine in the morning was when all of that car is on the air. But, since we're pretty, they did not want to kill all of that car, they simply wanted to move it. See, different car. You knew about cars was a popular program. It's it we certainly were trying to keep it on the schedule. The recommendation was to find a mutually agreeable car on set. after moves. We started with a specific time. We started with a specific time of three apopt. So what happened there was response? His response is absolutely right. This part is a bit of thinking of the three apoptization of the group. We have a side of the group. We do ask the group some of the systems  it. Our response to that was, well, is there any time on Saturday after you that we came back? That's the way we came back. that would be a real bout to you to be a special discipline. No. The last thing I said to them was I suggested we do a data clock place and we will think about it and get back to you. They got back to me by firing me. I never slightly rejected three clock and I've known it as me. What I rejected three clock yes I mean. Well, I understand why you would say no to three of clock. You have to understand that from Matt Joseph's perspective this was just a leadist insult from bosses with always talented and questioned the way he did his show. It means you're sensitive to the screen. After I was reading to the strong, sometimes he was the single strongest show in the Saturday morning on. She was expensive, she says, why couldn't I be more respectful? If somebody at the company is a payment, we've got a really weak ass to do. We think you can really help. And we're going to give you really adequate promotion and so on. Would you help us out, Mary? If somebody approached me, that would have listened to you, promptly, would have agreed to you. They know one definition of a fiasco is something small and ordinary, turns into something on-stress or large. And what do you be small in this world, my friend? And simply trying to use schedule and public radio cars show from the morning to the afternoon. When I threw shows cancelled, 1500 calls and letters came into this concept of radio with many of the matches we put back on the air. To reduce the network demand of $2,600 pledges to return, 1,26 people said they would never give money to them. Yeah. Badgers have started putting out a monthly newsletter about the Fiasco, the organized of Rally and Madison. They were editorial and local papers, letters to the editor, hence this will be said. It came to scholars. CardTalk is  a model for this crushed all of the independent car shows around the country one by one over the years. Just goes on with the jubbing one. He heads. something better. Now, there should be room for one series showing them a very unusual one show that is conquered. Well, finally, the state of Wisconsin legislature gives millions each year Wisconsin Public Radio did a state audit investigating matter. And the good program is showing up the offices of Wisconsin Public Radio. They showed up and all two auditors did show up to go to a list of files to see. The letters that came in from listeners regarding about cars made provided a complete conference room and they went through all of the letters and counted them up. How many were four of our cars and how many were four car talk? If you had to estimate how much time state employees had paid employees, had to spend and ended up spending the best of getting this. Was it two guys for a week? How long were they on this case? It went so similar when I took off. three months. Oh my god. I did it. It seemed to me that it went on for many weeks and it wasn't every day but it was very distracted. But this was not the only use taxpayer dollars in this urgent public matter. The joint audit committee of the state legislature, public hearing in which legislator's and listeners criticized Wisconsin Public Radio programmers. 40 people showed up from all over the state's test card. Made headlines right at the state. In all this. whether a car show should be moved to the afternoon. Not the air. Senator Robert Wurch who co-chair the hearing. Does his citizens with Wisconsin women? And he had no choice but half hearings. Are we  romanticizing another station? No. We were providing a forum all by the government. This doesn't matter. Act to say though, I mean, it's not so that it's not simply doesn't exist. It's, it's, it's, it's a strange notion that that's the good situation to get. So, what seems to be small? Well, this was a locally generated program in Wisconsin. What did they bring? And that worked program in format to us. That is clearly anger. I mean, this is not a new law, I guess. I mean, we have demonstrations in just about every city that brought it. And there are people who come to the station and they pick it up. Also, what is an uzage school that are still here? reflect on the work and click on the result and the arrangement. Right now they show their uniform. Well, for some perspective on this matter, I decided to go to the end of the hunt, the single most popular hour in public radio, who can crack Tom Drain Malayats. Since you guys weren't at the hearings, speaking your own sense, I wanted to play you a quote from state senator Robert Wirt, who held these words. Robert Wirt, Wirt, said, where Robert Wirt, who stayed at Wisconsin, who held these hearings, and I wanted to just, , play what he said about your show versus the local show, the first thing about going in matches, this, this excuse me, a chapter. answer is fine. Sure, I love to hear him. Here we go. Well, I missed the match-ups. I had doing a good connection for music knowledge. My card  I've seen in the next person. The other one I think we kind of show this with Lucky for a laugh. I can understand where a casual fan would be  after a long time. guys to do the show but and public radio are we used to listen to people a little more expertise. This funds? Yeah. Boy if that is not classic definition of a stiff I don't know what it is. Yeah he sounds  a barrel of land. What you look to have caught me with him on public radio where he more used to listening for a boring thing than these two jerks. Well tell him that we feel the same way about him. I was , enjoy listening to what he is. I will be voting for him anymore. Well, I mean, everyone has gone, okay. He's, I don't get to talk about what he said. No, I'm sure this other fellow people said, sir, they are all gone, they're all gone. They're certainly more informative than me. He says, oh, take the car business, he needs to upgrade that seriously. I would hit anyone. Oh, of course. Apparently not. No, there was no time in the air. Nobody spoke to you with you. And nobody. Why not? Why not? It's a panda ourselves. I would've flown my brother up here. The sense that Wisconsin Karsha, if you ask, if the S happens in much smaller scale. whenever any show, any followers, taken off any public radio station in this country. We did upset. Probably I think because every pledge drive, which is mean what? Every vote for your time, Zee, your university stations, listeners, here programmers  me, say, you are the public and public radio. And so listeners are understanding the angry, being the public and public radio. I'm going to show they  this suddenly, God. But it is exactly incidents  this one on the spot. programmers, theorists,  this one, is constantly. It makes innovation so slow in most of the public radio systems. I mean, that's it. I believe that Pissordioly has had a very chilling effect. Wisconsin Public Radio in in himself first. Joy Cardine who spent months dealing with this constant pressure for the asker says that now she thinks twice for moving any show. and it makes , poor junior, but poor Nah . or you make those kinds of decisions because you don't want necessarily public out cry or the legislature, examining your academic. This has goes also a terrible, bigger changes in public areas system. I started the process. There's a new system up lighter, more entertaining shows in the public videos especially for the games. Matt Joseph's Fiasco, for a part we could basically represent an older style public radio, more informative style. After some months off the air, Matt just now does show all about cars commercial station that we do TY medicine, zone up against cars. Hey Matt. Yeah. Is this over for you yet? Is it over yet? B-B-B-B. Now, it'll be over when the changes are made at Wisconsin Public Radio, the restores that service to what it used to be. A responsive service, and it's things  children's program, that has local drama that educate students and broadcasts and user-offings and open-ano, and they're in more. Are you describing all these things that are they used to do the kinds of things that are in public radio that didn't drive me chariots? Well, I think there's going to be room for things that don't drive me chariots, I think the people are  I won't get locked in the room for , calm and cr Brad Pitt, below and be quiet. Rm4r665 mCl Now and step up a little late and a little low Tonic Say in the word sight of the innerm macaron And the wind feels To hot out on the wheels I hardly know you But we've got to You feel so stressed And you're walking at the time At four The ask us is a course for good George Cooney, Jennifer Aniston, Shannon D'Aurody, Jody Foster, Alicia Silverstone, Brad Pitt, County Reaves, Sharon Stone, and John Trevota.

She does big magazine features stores, big magazines, but the dairy very first, being features scientists who have been sent out on, by publication tsp 1982. Los Angeles Reader sent out a very nervous, very youthful Harvey Waffland. And as you move, you never have a Frank, but as you sent it to her second interview ever after the release of Pervino Way, Hitsa. Now we go. In this little bit that she does on the song, she's using a lot of this language that , sort of, Val speak that no one had ever heard before. I was considered really exotic. And so I was from the ballet, so I was sent to go talk to her. She is one of your people. Speak her in your... secret private our gosh. And of course what is so touching to me is that I totally bought that you're right. I'm the right person for the job. I'm going to go speak to her in the valley language we will bond. I'm going to go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out. And see how much is so much is so much is so much so much. So you get there in your bit nervous and pressures which is post setting for a possible possible triumph. or possible , he asked, oh, right. And what I noticed was that it was not, it was a tense situation. I just didn't feel  it was going very well, and the mother was sort of hovering. But we have a recording of it. Because you had a taper quarter blow in there. Yes. And then you're hanging out with the valley, because , blowing out the green archery, very touching. well, right? trying at this point I'm sure that that rock bottom level that everyone can get at an interview where you're just saying, , , you wish you were a favorite counselor, right? And she's trying to help me a lot. So, I've heard of it. It's gone. Now, of course, I've seen it, yes, so very. So we're seated in the Dan and the mother, maybe coffee. But I was too nervous to drink it. But I kept staring at it, and she kept staring at it. And I felt  it was pretty important at some point. I better drain that coffee cup. And so what happened was moon-told me a joke. And I didn't see the joke coming. And right before she told me the joke, I had taken a big swag of the coffee, which was now cold. And which told me the joke, I burst out laughing. And I started to choke. And so I pressed my lips together. So it's been... it out and going to a spit take and the copy came shooting out my trouble. Shooting out your nose. Shooting right out my trouble. I'm gonna go, okay. I was really embarrassed but it's so happy. I can't breathe. At the same time I was choking and I jumped up and I sort of started running around the room, knocking things over and Ianned. I don't think they, I think I think that they didn't know what was going on. It's not the mother again, she basically... She's got changing you. She began changing me because she could, , I was sort of running from corner to corner, trying to catch my breath and she began sort of shifting to me. And at a certain point, she got behind me and she gave me the high-milton over. I don't care. Oh, Tyler! It's been a record for 20 years and nobody's ever given me that to the high-movement. It's a benchmark. It's a very low benchmark. I can do any interview. I can get thrown off the set. I can be cursed out by this subject, but I can leave it getting  a hard. I can drive on the thing. I didn't go, I don't know. What happened? What happened? it was sort of  we all been in an earthquake together and all of the nervousness left the room and suddenly we were three gals just chatting and I remember that I spoke  hard to both when I left it wow there are now my friends it's interesting that it's one of our criteria for BASC is that all social ordered normal social structure breaks down literally that's what happens here the normal interview stops and the social structure structure of the moment completely changed the mom gives you the time. And then suddenly it stops feeling  new. Yeah, no, it was really. And I have to say that , but it was a very embarrassing experience and it completely made me feel close to them. It was so interesting when moons father died a while ago. I bumped into her somewhere and I am the both person to tears. I mean, I really felt  a little sister might have had a loss. I mean, , the starting point was . I, that moment. To me, the thing about it that's useful is that it shows the use of purpose. That is, when social work breaks down, that can be a force not just for chaos and for entropy, but even. But in fact, that can be a force for good. Why? They can bring people to get. Why? Because they know it was actually this huge success to me. I'd never been sent out under this kind of sort of certain. before I remember we beat the local paper, they heard the exam, they followed us a loop later, and so we at the first story, it was sort of considered the definitive one, because we had this glossary of terms that I had made, or put together, and a valley speak. A valley speak terms, and then it was syndicated. And most of the portable stuff that you ended up using in your story, you haven't had it after the last one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
