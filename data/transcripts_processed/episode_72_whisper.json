  "text": "In the BBC Chicago Public Radio International, it's a American life from our class. Today I'm not talking about the story of two Americans who went to South Africa, one's wife, one's black. And they went there because there's something about South Africa, but then we met, something familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, where that makes it as merged. Robert Kennedy described this congruent to nations as well as anybody. In 1966 he was visiting South Africa, and he began a speech at the University. this Cape Town this way. I come here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, then taken over by the British and it passed independent. A land in which the native inhabitants were at her subdued, but relations with whom we remain a problem to this day. A land which was more... months, the importer of slaves, and now I'm a struggle to wipe out the last crisis of that form of bondage. I repure a course for the United States of America. It's done pause for the audience begins a clotting. It gets so beautiful. More than England, France. or Israel, more than Canada, Japan. When we think of South Africa, it is a more interesting mirror of United States than nearly any country. I think because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of our own country. Kind of as inspiring parts. In the 1950s and 60s, Black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. In the 1950s, Black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. In the 1950s, Black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. Who is Nicholson of the Sophia Town? Who remembers reading American literature Find some huses, simple speaks his mind. We used to walk. What you were afraid is that you found it to us , to hands it. And listening to the music, you've found, , from you where the topics to watch again... problems  our neighborhood was because it says, Black Sabbath applicants in the quiet town listen to physical SP and Shirley Parker and Miles Davis fried to dress and talk at Lena Horne and Cab Calaway and the second town gang members model themselves after Hollywood movies dressed in zoot suits pick up phrases and top-guide films Street with no name. We wanted to not found  a mountain, grey too a mountain calter and we wanted also someשizada by David just became Black on planet planet and Black on planet, because off the N science test, right? Great. Mm-hmm. … I'm a guy, so the country where you have sex with Marshall, working to eliminate a lot of evil rights of people. and getting to the greater and for, so these people are the movement in the open direction for where we were moving. Nations  man often march to the peak of different drunks, and the precise solutions of the United States that need to be dictated nor transplanted to others. What is important however is that all nations, plus march towards... increasing freedom. So, just as for all, you must do this not because it is economically advantageous, although it is, not because the laws of God command it, although they do, we must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do. America's a valendo of Pope Jesus, but to say now for a person we really did believe that. Now of course the situation is reversed. Once Nassim and Delicate out of prison and especially after he entered the President's office, it's been black Americans who worked South Africa's inspiration. Two years ago I did a series of stories from National Public Radio with the South African are in race relations in the US and race relations. in South Africa. And one of the most striking differences between the way the Blacks and the two countries saw things was, Blacks in South Africa, they said they had hope. Of course it isn't just Black Americans who look to South Africa and see a place where things have changed and things getting better in small ways. Today we've developed an entire program to destroy two guys who look to South Africa that way. Do just the tail and it's run. But then grew up in the normal Marass, post civil rights race relations in this country. What schools they were integrated, but what black some whites usually stayed separate, rarely next. So they headed to the New South Africa for a few weeks. And it turns out they did not agree on what they saw there. While we bring you today is partly a story of the emerging multi-racist society over there, partly a story about the one here at Hall. And played the sport-do-eye weapon. Which starts us? It was my idea to go to South Africa, I'd met the South African guy at work, and told me that South Africa is the most beautiful country in the world, and that everything you see on TV about it is wrong. I asked Josh to go with me. I had another reason for wanting to be the South Africa. I just got an letter from some South African guy named Ben Zion, Sceptel, asking if he might be related. My family is very small, beside my parents and two sisters. I don't know if you really can see it right now. I guess I was simultaneously excited and scared. I mean, it's not every day that the size of your family is so many doubles. But when they're white-south Africans, all these questions pop in your hand. The first and most obvious question being, so do they hear black people. I mean, what do you do when your family doubles in size, but when you have to be a bunch of white supremacists? I decided not to share any of these worries with Rich. Judgment 10 years ago in college, we ended up living in the same house and we lived together often non-sense them. Judges of the son of a Jewish doctor in the suburbs, I grew up in the city by parents of public high school teachers. He's white, I'm black, but none of this has ever been an issue. Before this trip, I don't think we ever had one serious talk about race. We both wanted to see the new South Africa, to see how much the country had changed since Nelson Mandelton Power 2 years ago. We decided to begin. against search and neighborhood called Giovo. The free magazine that gave you on the plane had an article about it. Lots of glossy pictures of blacks and whites laughing together in the streets, tricking together in bars and clubs, eating together in restaurants. Giovo is a party. The street is lined with outdoor cafes, people are wearing Nike T-shirts, New York Yankees hats, all kinds of American stuff. The scene is just  the magazine pictures, blacks and whites talk together. drive by us in the BMWs and Mercedes. When rich and I go and do convenience store to get a drink, there's a tall black man wearing a public enemy T-shirt in the corner. He's playing Pac-Man. Actually, things are going to grow for you. , we're just mixing up. Back up to continue, guys. I think you're colliding. You're colliding. You're colliding black and America. Okay, that's black. , you white, right? I'm white. Yeah, sure, sure. That's okay. I mean, that is black, is positive. You can look  my woman. He's sending over by the payphone. His girlfriend was Pump and Rosie. And she jumped in and read Casmir can go away. She's not from around here, but still I've got you up. I've got you up my own money. I want to keep my money. I've got you to fuck some of my money. But it's  anyway. I think that this is , do you think that your bill is maybe one of the best places right now because it's mixed? So that's Ruka. Sure. Sure. What's that? That's a... I'm a page of my name. Guess what I'm, what does it say? Talking nonsense. It's so tough. Your girlfriend just aged you from across the room. Yeah, she just went to the phone calling and paging me there, , and it's  a beep beep. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. She's... Anyway, guys, what's your girlfriend's name? Mari. Mari, if you came into the store five years ago with Mari, a white woman black man, what would have happened? How would you be dead eight years ago? You would have been dead eight years ago. That's true. White woman... You are whoa weird about that. Because it was , I would have been killed by my own brothers. Because they were fighting against the white people. And if they would have seen me, the white woman, that's the end. It was our first day in South Africa, and it seemed  everything you'd want it to be. Everything you dreamed of for the new multiracial society. Blacks and whites together. Pack me. personal pages. We went to the Peter Palace for a celebratory sublucky and their celebration was cut short. I'm now 21 years old, right? And what I did was I decided that I have to leave this country to meet the owner of the Peter Palace. My Congress, my children here, there's so much crime that I'm just making too hard to take your stuff and go. They come into house, they're breaking, they rape your wife. Thanks. shoot you and totally destroy your life. Kind of  the black people taking revenge on the white sport party. Someone got around and said, let's charm the mother of the country and it's working because every single year, the immigration is going up. Do a lot of white people are leaving. Yeah? Didn't  this? Thousands, thousands. I know hundreds of families that have immigrated this year. You can leave soon. As soon as I came over the next few days we would hear a imagery story over and over. Wherever we went people talked about crime and fear and white's leaving. That night when we walked home through the dark streets of Johannesburg we found a shiny bullet shell on the pavement. We took a cab the rest of the way home. You're excited? What are you doing today? Going to see people. I think my knowledge is. That's what I'm saving. So how many times have you talked to them? Well, I've talked to them on the phone. Once. Twice. Do you think they're, they're safe right now too? It can only hope so. Any nervous? Really? I mean... , it could be interesting. Well, what if you don't oppress them? I'm just afraid that they're going to be racist and they're going to be huge to your black. You'd never forgive me what? So you're going to have a little anxious energy. We sift those arms. We got these stories, , did you? But we are suppose to have a telly on him when he got over his association with Mandela. And we tell you. So here we are with my long lost family sitting around a big table piled with the Zanya and fresh baked bread. Our Harold Safftele, his sister's dolly and Molly Safftele. Dough. send Luis and rich and I. They remind me of my relatives back in his connecting. Josh looks  Luis, it was easy to believe they were related, nevertheless you spend several long hours around dinner, trying to prove it. So Uncle Borough is which person? Yes, that's my father, Louis, . That's Louis, the little boy actually. And then Uncle Borough is... They pull that some old photos including that turn of the century photograph every t... Jewish family has. It's black and white ragged at the edges with a neatly posed family. Father in this picture had a thick white beard, heavy eyelids, and a black-bremed hat. He was probably my great uncle. Yes, really, he was a smart-up-end kid. He was a lady. Oh, really? Yes, he had lots of ladies. There's something about meeting Distribuletive so far from home. There's this immediate bond that's basic and powerful. This feeling  you're all players on the same team, even though you... just met. But at the same time, mainly because Rich was there with me, I was nervous, and wanted to know what the people around the dinner table had done during a part-time. It's embarrassing to think about now, but I asked them repeatedly to talk about those years. At first they were reluctant to discuss it, but finally they did. I was relieved to find out that Harold was all in the 60 year old with squinty eyes, not only knows what he was doing. He was one of his doctors. After Mandela came out of prison, he knew. and his kids for lunch. During a part-time, Molly was active in the group called the Black Sash, which pick it outside the court buildings. They did it, what did we do? We thought they'd be here, and they'd be there to the streets. We'd be on the streets. We'd be there. Were you working with some black horses? I worked in a black horse car. Look at those items. How many changed the attitude of students towards the school? What was that? I was. You described myself as active as students. It turns out Harold Sunday that used to drive around giving medical care to black activists, who would you scare to go into the state hospitals. Harold's daughter Lisa is a member of Mandela's party to the ANC. She was arrested and imprisoned for several months during the struggle and had to go into hiding underground for years. For a while, Lisa's Aunt Dolly and Dolly Samluis, who are less political, let her stay at their house. We went to Israel, she's that's when she's dead. I moved in here with the A and C. That's a great story during that during that year because she needed a place to hide. We said that you could stay here and she could run whatever she wants to hear because we're saved. It was with actors hanging out in your little, so this is a great cover for her. So, she stretched out and she spread out by the tool. All the A and C. The communist just laid out by the poor. We know from Joseph, just from allowing his work for us for 35 years. And Joseph tells us that every day you could cook for them. And he would bring the meals and you would serve them as they were writing there. New letters and they probably get it. Even though the wrist seemed to have some problems with the ANC, Harold New Mandela, Lisa was in ANC. Molly was perfect. testing in the streets. As far as I was concerned my family passed the test. My fear that they would be a bunch of white supremacists was put to rest and I felt really, I felt uncomfortable. Dying Lewis got this nervous, self-congregatory tongue talking about some of this stuff. And we're very unique. First of all, we're the, I wear one in the few white families because it's got a black child in the family. I mean, I'm the aunt of this and they're not many Jewish families have got black children. and I don't think there are any other Jewish families. And there's one family but they adopted the Black child. There was just one of those situations we never forget you the only Black person in the room. After eating, let's took us on a short tour of their state. We saw their expansive bedrooms, pools, jacuzzies, and finally tucked around the back of the house with the servant's quarters, which consisted of a tiny main room of four beds and a closet-sized bathroom. One worker was in the room at the time watching the dim black and white TV. Besides, his head on the wall was a photocopy of a game board. Let's tell you that this was a lottery game, but if you picked it right squared, you won the pot for that week. I asked him who played. He pointed the servant and said him patronizing tone that all of them do. The servant shook his head to say that he did not play the Lewis repeated that all of the last two. Later, there was this awkward moment, awkward for me and right. When Daly and Lewis were talking about hell, son of Lisa. I bought friends with black. It's worth it. So the blessing, right? But always... Exactly. I find... She doesn't criticise my twitchy, did say that the blacks, the boy for her boyfriends, were not faithful, , they had lots of women. And even the men that she's had the baby with, he's had a, he's got a child. But I hope that he's faithful to her. Well, I don't know how she meant it. That's keeping statement about what all blacks are . All blacks are unfaithful. That's it. Then let me know who they were. I'm saying I went over to that family and I felt tension because of the reason. That's what I'm saying. I don't quite understand what was changedably so hard to share his. Back at the hotel we talked about it. It's just the first time that I had seen quite settlers talking about blacks and their... And their us domestic helping them who they keep around. It was just... I didn't realize how. Even the most liberal ways are aren't necessarily the most, ? They're probably have leased in their family because they're not where they can say they're not that they are in fact the most liberal ways. But it's almost  you don't want to  them. This is... I'm serious. I... I did not go in there and I wanted to  them. But I definitely felt tense and I didn't know why I felt tense. And I started to feel bad and I started not wanting to be there. The future is being lost right now. You let the room and it was just all of us in the room. We had nothing to talk about these more talking to you all. It was noticeable silence and it was nothing going on. You honestly believe that most weights have everything families are more liberal or as liberal as them. No, I didn't say that. I said exactly what I said. I went and I saw it and I was reality and I felt and that's what happened to me. Period. I'm not taking that away from you. Okay. You want to fight more? Hmm? You've lied about what I feel. I guess I'm saying that I don't know. I mean, I was pleasantly surprised that they were less racist than I could ever have expected. Well, did you hear what I'm saying? That's good. And yes, that is good. But I'm still allowed to be upset about it. And I am in fact upset about it. And  what it's ? It's exactly  America. There's not your lie intention. And people want to be friends and all that. But on the underside, they're all just fucking. It's... This is where... This is where... This is where... I'm here here. So you can do this wonderful book here. Which needed a break for my family, so when Molly came to pick us up for breakfast, I went alone. She gave me a driving toward the neighbor home. Okay, now in this house, she should. In this house, this lady was attacked. They jumped over their fence. They beat her up. I'll show you. We are another person with me. We drove through peaceful, we can neighborhoods with big houses, but almost every house was surrounded by a high fence and barbed wire. One neighborhood had a man check point to keep people out and be belong. Another had our own security guards controlling the tree line streets on Bison Kong. We drove past an area that  a golf course, with a neatly man-tured lawn, and right by the curb, half hidden by the shrubbery, where maybe half a dozen black people sitting in laying on grounds. In this bush here, the people squat anywhere where they're water. The home is squat. It's amazing, this looks  a very well-a-neighbrewed, a very large, large, square-ers. When my dophalobies are here, these are bringing it out into common. And I look through the window and I'll say, there's one of these squabbers. So, that's what I'm going to do. She said, yes, he said, please, Madam, please, I want some bread. So I said, don't give it to him because he will send hundreds here. You may have what be killed. And leave him alone. You can't tell the others. You don't give him anything. She just begs, breaches, saying, we do that. He's warning you. Where you find your mother? But she went on and let us mortise a cheese and that's it. She's laughing. She's gonna tell all the others and we'll see. It'll be terrible. Leave it, don't do it, don't do it. She walks up to the gate and he says, I'm mad about listening. She said, don't you add it to your camera. Something. And  what? The next day. That we're eating. We were back at her house. She pulled her car up to the big gates and punched the hood. Metal doors slowly parted and we drove in. And  how we used to live before in that face. Labrary had faces. Crime has gotten worse since the end of the part time, but it's not a big as increases most people think. Since 1994, the murderary has actually dropped 14%. Carthas have dropped. Home burgolese has increased only 11%. The biggest increase in crime is non-residential robberies, which is up 50% and rape, which is up 36%. What's happening is that crime in the white areas is now becoming the same as it's always been in black temperatures. Justin I won't get in the long soles since the fight in the hotel room. In the ten years we had known each other. We never really fought in the fight. So we decided the best thing. for a friendship, we'd need to get away from this family, an out-of-jornal's prayer. We rented a tiny boat swag and we set out to see more of the New South African. We drove for hours over Greenwell and Hills. The deeper we got in the country, the fewer and fewer white faces we saw. Every so often we'd see a cluster of pink and aquamarine hats on the whole side. A village. Finally we stopped at one. There's a group of guys. are you sitting in an old car seat next to one of the huts? They look  they're waiting for something to happen. They didn't seem happy to miss out on anything. They promised us, man, they promised us jobs. There's nothing they usually have, I have a fub in the wrong place. So our three men were unemployed, not for Wayne. The tough men, the cup of the shaved head with black door at the fire. Poses at the new government and family brother  Chris, which is village, just that week. They bring us electricity. Fests? Why not? Waterfest? Why didn't they ask us what thing do you want, Fest? I want to eat electricity. I want to drink electricity. Where are we going to get money to buy this electricity? If we are not employed. The invited seat of Shibin for beers. They asked us questions about America, about our girlfriends, about the federal system. How we  people in the office. They told us a story about white black men's and white men's sons as a long. They asked me a favor. relative Michael Jackson and they complained about the new salt African properties. The wind set of he would present it, Peter Nack, a much more radical redistribution, Nelson and Dallas Harris. But I should do all those white men's area, white men's toilet. I will do it upside down. If this was black men's toilet then that is the white men's toilet. I take the wise there and tell them to come here in placement of tourists and then I bite. Why it's only? Don't know what you think maybe that said they should be a rare thing. But it doesn't hate it, read more hatred. It's in the blood now, it's in the blood. So the name of the Shibin, Josh and I will more relax with the chan. There's nothing  a little talk about a part and to make you forget your Christian One of the guys had an old recording out on the car scene. I asked him to play a song. did, but Roman here in the Talvez. For these guys, the new South Africa was a lot  the old South Africa. They were still without water and work and they still felt powerless. Part of it done more than just separate the races that he created the last in sense of black and blue morning. Plasticity decids as more, as more powerful. They think that's more powerful, why do they decidate the earth? if they speak, they are, and they have got money and whatever they need. We can always see ourselves in Syria as a swimming team too. We did that, and it's still a swimming team. That thing will not end. On the way out of the village, we ran into three teenage village girls. One of them were a thick layer of white face paint  a mask. She said it was for pimples. We were talking and they were teaching us how to say hello and hoarse up. And then the girl with face paint turned them up and sober. She looked at Rich's skin which was a few shades lighter than her own. Then she looked at mine which was a few shades lighter still. Then she looked at both of us. Are you brothers? She asked us. I trip to South Africa continues with the South African Woodstock and an organization that's happy. Nancy Reagan's just say no, a half terrorist group. That's a minute. Public Radio International went on program continues. It's a American life, my regardless, each weekend of program of course which is the meaning, usually you're being a variety of difference. stories on that theme today, we're devoting our whole show to just one story about Seth Akharka's emerging multi-racist society and about America's. If you just tuned in of Richardson and Josh Seth Heller of Best Friends, once Black, once White, Riches in New Yorker, Josh's from Boston, we travel together with the new Seth Akharka, not long after Nelson Mandela, president's office, meets people who Josh thinks might be distant relatives, is, and to see what's changed since Nelson Mandela began his harassment. in the multi-racial society. Ammoness? Seborr! Who? Who? Amor! What does that mean? It means they don't  you! Who are the descendants of Dutch settlers in South Africa? On the stereotype is their farmers, their racists, their African Red Naps. Group of whites who actually voted for apartheid and built the apartheid steep. it become obsessed with them. Every white person with suspect, especially in the countryside. Here you see a lot of wars. Actually yeah, we have on dirt roads, dudes driving cars with bus cuts and crazy looking eyes. Tans can, don't you think those are wars? Do you think they look  that? They're bus cut. I guess I don't. I'm not looking for wars. I only notice it when you say it. In fact, I came to South Africa hoping you can find real races. In American now, races and is  this cloud that's still surrounding me, but you can't touch it or see it. You just feel it, and you go to a party or you go into a store. But in South Africa, quite a pressure officially just ended two years ago. I came here thinking it would be  seeing what it was  during bus boycotting the sixties or during the Civil War. I came here looking for the enemy. Which didn't bother me as long as rich wasn't looking for my family to be that enemy. Bure! That's dust-foot. Bure! We'd read about a place called Rustlers Valley in our country. It said that Rustlers was one of the most progressive places in the country, maybe I'm counting. A kind of ongoing South African wood star. When we got there there were lots of hippy looking people were gone here, it's toting average on streams and condos. The horde culture there looked  something out of the doctor's shoes book. On one hillside it looked  someone was holding a VW van convention. On another hillside we joined a group of people who were in middle of experiencing sound journey. They all sat in a circle with their eyes closed and their legs crossed. And the middle of the circle was in the man with a bunch of instruments. We were blowing on a decision of you. When he stopped, they went around the circle talking about how the sound journey made me feel. So, the message is... I actually still feel quite out of my body. Really. And thank you for creating the space to help me get going. Just feeling incredibly emotional. I experienced such a movement to... I don't know if it was my bloodstream or so. Down by the river it was  Eden. There were people swimming naked and horses drinking from water and running wild. A group of two women and two men were passing around reefers, the size of small cigars. But most of the action or wrestlers took place around a giant flaming globe. At night hundreds of kids danced to techno music in the firelight. Next through dance book. or was a pool where a new swimming was encouraged. There was a room called the Passion Pit, with low couchs, dim lighting, and intercline bonds. There was the TV village, rich and I went down there and ran into the sky where I mock us and snickers and a feather head dress. He wrote a joint and talked to us about rustlers for last time. Very much believes that psychedelics have been around since the beginning of time, that they did in man's evolution. And I think that can take us towards the future. I'm certainly just going into this avian. the first not boundaries and I just feel we are and what we are, we are about. So, smoke a lot of dope. A lot of people in our governments are smokers, they were left wearing a revolution reason, radicalism. I've personally had met a conversation with these deputy stat folks about him and a rather full play and regenerate your own economies. The time I wandered into a techno-berg on Americano 60s. But if America's 60s were about to blame, it wasn't clear from anyone we talked to, who are what exactly, Russ' listeners, be with Alan Giesd. In the smokey bar in the dance frame, you met the founder of her stories. He's 40 something with the ponytail, beard, and an African rapic covered his hairy legs to the knees. His name was Frick, explained him. He's 60. structure that we were battling against the America. We see them misleading all world down, so they're corporate dead end to sort of near modernism, they're leaving those space for society to develop. We believe we need to return to shamanism, return to magical return to values of the earth, understanding of self-abmustistic people. We see a source of inspiration as being the SD people that corporate world has dead end. So the American government was the enemy and the solution was the ethnic peoples. The only problem was there were no ethnic peoples there. The country made up of zoolas and belle, suttu and sosa. The country with 12 official native languages. Besides the kitchen workers and occasional gardener, I was the only black person at Russos. Josh and I did a little informal survey. Why no black people? If it's anyone who ever wants to come from common, maybe black people just down into it. That is plenty. They come up here to work and clean. Do the gardens. They're not into the same thing, means. Black people don't  graves and raised parties, and they don't see that as a bad thing. We have a very good report, as we go to town and all the way, but as soon as we're free. But part had takes a lot of time to dissolve and... Even if you want to cross the barriers, they're not that easily crossed. because they've always been separate. It's a pity. This is value was really a part of the misoherty. There's more  a theme park for recreational and flood users. The summer community escaped for the more itself athletes. We didn't happen to think about the crime rates and the futures in this country. After two days, when we finally got back into our room, we found a young blonde hairdwoman, a squad cross-worned for a casual, joint and bed screen. This five in the morning we'd had enough. We asked for relief. Back in the States I almost never noticed race, but since I'd been in South Africa I found myself noticing it whenever I were rich and I walked into a room. I'd look around and think are there any black people here? I worried you'd be uncomfortable. Do you feel  they're cheating you definitely then? They're cheating me as a white person. Oh yeah sure. That's that it's that it's that expectation I was I walked in the I walked in the main room and a couple people behind the desk and two or three people were hanging out and they were there have at least two conversations possibly three no different groups of people not many people six people and walking the room close to door and everyone's quiet. Literally, I mean, come on. You didn't two or three conversations just happened. And it's great. Exactly. I'm all right walking, but... But, , I open my mouth. I say a couple words. I make a joke. And it lights everything up to them. They feel okay, that's all right. But I only am able to do that because I know that if I prove to them that I am from out of the country, then they'll feel comfortable again. They don't have... it's something that they can tell cool that. Every time I see somebody in try to talk, make Woody jokes so that it's easier. In the morning the sound drink before I uttered again.

The steady students spit. that splattered on to a forehand in the islands. She didn't seem to notice. As we were driving out of Brussels, someone approached the car and gave us a bullet and sandwiched back, followed marijuana, and a bumper stick on it. It said, hot will save the world. Grads are the fundamental thing. Grads is the... Of course, of all the other violence in the civil rights. In the mosque in Cape Town, the medical group called the god, short for people with and angstres and drugs.

I'm not a corrupt, but I'm a corrupt, but I'm a corrupt, but I'm a corrupt, but I'm a maker of the world. While hundreds of Muslims create a huge main hall, we're in a small classroom off the side.

Each heavier on solid of phones, which interrupts as constantly throughout the infant. The leader is Aslam Tofi, giant Indian man with enormous hands. He depths his brow with a lively Terry cloth hanging. If you go to parties tonight with nightclubs where you go, what is the reality of that? Please to get drunk, to get zonka to your mind through some kind of drag. Is this what we want? Is this what God intended? Will he create it? Us as human beings? God or mighty? Curses us for these things. So we will never have peace in our lives. God is famous for their method of getting people to just say no. They go to drug dealers house, pull them into the street, and set them on fire. There had been an incident  this six month earlier, a drug dealer had been burned to death in the street, and they got out felt they're partly incident had been misrepresented in the press. So we go to the bathroom. or who had been hired until then explained the God's sign. A group of people went to ask the specific person, please can you stop to the rugby with the people suffering? They were met with gunfire from 3 meters inside the house. 17 people were shot at from behind bulletproof windows to people standing on a pavement which is 2 meters wide. So people was firing 3 meters into crowd with about 5,000 people. As a sat there imagining what I would do with 5,000 people showed up at my doorstep, but legal advice are turned to us. Where were you listening? Where were you? Last night. As I fumbled for an answer, Toe-fi explained how drinking, naked dancing, nightclubs, and abortions are all destroying your new South Africa. A lot of things learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to study, not only when you learn how to learn how to learn how to learn. Outside the mosque there was a wall of graffiti. Killed. Jews, kill Americans, has balah. Everywhere we turn in South Africa, people seem to be looking for quick and easy solutions to massive and complex problems. Whether that meant belonging to an alternative community or being an anti drug crusader, killing Americans and burning drug dealers, or smoking dope. It was time to return to your hand as per the second bite of Josh's family and escape himself after him. We had been getting along fine since he left the septels too exerlier, no fighting. But now with only four hours of highway between us and them, the attention returned. I was driving, Josh and the microphone were facing. It had been harder. I get the sense that when you meet a white person here, you make the assumption that we're having a hard time Presidings moves. until proven innocent. I don't think whiteies here are automatically racist. I mean that's what you said before I put the tape for you a little bit later, but you did say that. Well, I'm sure that I did not say they're active for inactive races and they were not too categories and we can replay the tape as many times. Mr. Seth Tellers, we need to. What I mean. This is. one of the arguments where you just go to the same tiny points over and over again. I didn't catch on at first, they all seemed  reasonable questions, but then I realized what it was looking for. Justin, in one my opinion, raises him with the innocence of whites. Justin wanted me as a black person, to admit that his white South African family were the good guys. I love round shapes, and I both are the planet of the South's shape of big, breast with the fireplace being the nipple, three dimensionally, frosting through. double stories we can get never look at this end of the morphic habitable woman Facking Johannesburg my cousin Lewis took us out of tour of his latest mass juice Lewis is not to to story house still under construction doesn't really look  a huge breast and it's just got lots of curved walls and curved ceilings a lot of breast orientation oh yeah yeah have a quick quick view at this round facade over here okay so let me ask you this what why do you why do you put somebody breast shape in your architecture. Well, I'll tell you why. People have an immediate response. I've taken people into my breasts and they are so moved and they are so silly. They can't quite work out why they why they  these spaces but they they would  these spaces because they feel hugged and encompassed by them. And it's hard to dislike with us. It's such an entertainer. I don't even think to come self-series. In our time in Johannesburg, took us out after Dolendus's car. and by the friends of his over so we'd have people meet. More time it's been in South Africa, the harder and harder it was from the totally good guys from the Athens. But there were still times that didn't know what to make of people  Lewis. For instance, camped out in the middle of a half-filled house in the rain, where at least a half-dust in black man who built a fire in the middle of the living room. If you've heard those guys in the rain and met by the fire, the fire is fine. These are workers' lilies, so they should get the workers live on site. It's got a lift here. This is the lift. , they live in Semen's floor and they are headbuilders, they have to say casuals, they produce their CV skill, they break layers, plasterers and stuff. And they can't really... and what's great about it is they're using the house in the way the house is meant to be used. It's important to find insight in the fireplace where it was meant to be. But it's going into the lounge. This is a great lounge. Good evening gentlemen. Good evening how are you? Good we have a report to you from America. From America. He's going to tell a wonderful story about this house anyway. He showed us the kitchen in the bedroom in the living room and the small servants quarters attached to the side of the house. And here's the story of the little sweet. And here are the nice beautiful lovely main bedroom and bathroom and kitchen. Very nice. It's going to be a big statement. The servants forever. Absolutely 7th. So yeah, in Africa to stay forever. In fact, we must make the very nice because maybe a couple of years of his. We were moving to the service court as the service moving to the harbour. What have you said? What I'm saying is that he was in the bylaws of the old South Africa, the law, that your service court has had to be very small, the little size and the very high windows, not overlooking in public space. Now, our service court has already made more of sureness and they more , it's still kind of got a vintage granny set kind of thing. Because we might have to move into the Monday. and read the house after the service. On this last visit to join this bird, we stayed with my family at Valley's house. In this time, we really felt  being late one night after Rich went to sleep. I talked with Valley in the kitchen about the ups and downs in my love life. See you. to meet a married Jewish girl. It was just  talking to any of my relatives. When I first got to South Africa, I had been more willing to judge Dahlia in the others, but now that I had seen more of the country, I didn't feel that way anymore. I guess at some level it just didn't feel right to judge family. In the same way that judging your parents harshly for having different opinions that you do doesn't feel right. But rich living so sure. I don't feel skeptical of my family. But I relatives here. I think you do. I think you feel a little bit skeptical. I mean, how could you, they're rich, they've got badass houses, they've got service. ? It's just, it's  people living the South that still have domestic slaves. I guess it is. a job for somebody but just get your bad minders of ways what was what was. So do you  the stuff tells you you're not  the stuff tells? I think they're good people. I'm glad we had a chance to meet them. But ... There's still rich in white. Yeah That the end of the day when the chips are cashed in they still have servants You feel If you were here you would have done more or less than What position would you be in the septal family? Do you think you would have done you would have gotten involved in the struggle or I don't know, it's hard to hear. , I mean, there's so many variables. I would hope that I would have been involved in some line. , it's  how can you guess what you would have done? , no. Another day, another dinner with Josh's family, argued by a dinner. The conversation revolved around few ongoing obsessions. Did you hear the news today about this new game is going around? They're writing young women. On this visit, they see more beleaguered than anything else. They told us about all their friends who've been robbed and attacked. Molly explained her she've been mugged at night point. I'm always looking for myself at the glass. The windows and airs eyes. Look. I see two types of fat in the meat. Jump out of the shed is that I jumped into the street and they followed me. They grabbed my band and they put it pulling me along the ground. I was screaming and I was coming from Canada. And it must have been doing this for about three minutes. When coming towards us is an elderly white couple. Just be the best 70s. and the man who'd out of gut, and he shocked the one on the side of me, and I said, ANYONE TO! HIMTU! It's not long ago, Molly has been famous and powerful. She was an actress who'd been in lots of plays in a few films. She was the first white actress to appear in stage with a black. Her husband, Monty, had been a politician and served as the mayor of Joe Harrisburg during the seven years. But he died a few months before he arrived. Now she did by herself in the big house with a big wall surround. She was alone, separate of black servants. One of the churning points in her life was a South African. One of the moments that changed her from an activist into the person she has become, was the day that the reptiles had waited for for years. The day Nelson Mandela was released from prison. The day started off, just fine. Well, it was totally a for-year. Our family got on a plane and we drove, we flew to Cape Town and stood in the square and waited for her on dinner to come. And we waited and waited. in the island and it got hot as hot as haters. The life-friended was with me. She was punched in the stomach and the camera was stoned. It was an enormous crowd of people. And they were crushing you and crushing you. It literally didn't have any time in each space to breathe. And we must have been there for about six hours when we decided we must get out. Because we began to fear for our safety. It was that sort of encouragement on our own. I'll now tear it to. And this is what's happening now. The New South Africa was working out the way I'm expecting. It complained that since the game's seats of power, the mail services horrible, there's litter in the streets, the government's corrupt. And they're scared. I mean, they're scared to know in homes. So that's what we've become. We're not a threat to anybody. Pay our taxes to immediately tip-toe through the land. I hope  what you're . Now I must be young people and I'm not leaving. one of my colleagues children is in Greenwich, one of Peros, and another of Peros songs is probably even seen. Perotomy then 15 years there will be hardly any set of tells left in South Africa. The only one family in South Africa has been the most democratic and a bit of a dysenthical language. And then I think you say Michael, it wasn't guilty or to say it was him. Even at this last bit, even getting along with them as well as we were, there were still things about myself that wrote Swedish to the British. And it might have been in polite, but you just asked them over and over, what did they do during the part-time? They felt guilty. Thank you so much for the time being. We don't think that. Last such words, what's the right word? I mean, it's quite ridiculous. We are not guilty to this state. But in other words, but not because... We do. We do. We do. you take up arms, we've been interested but I've been in our own little way where we kind of, I know the fact that we used this. What does we have done? I mean, we have the good of the point. The guy who saw a recent one. It's  this point. It's done what that's what the first did. What a first that she went to jail and her family was destroyed. That's where they were. You want that? Wait, that's that. Should have affected. we were here and helped to teach educated children, to seek and so on and so on. That was surely far better than being a boss, but we did not do it actively. And why are we going to be here? Surely, we were making a contribution to the initiative. Never a boss or a new one. So that was it. Now that we're back in the States, Richard and I never really talked about what happened in South Africa. I guess we've said everything we're as excited as time. It's been several months since we've been back and we haven't had a single fight. The director of the UK President adopted the data rebellious analysis of quadricious services on a marine system.
