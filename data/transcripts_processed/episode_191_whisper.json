I pulled the plates, stuffed my things in the back, took the stereo and my rainbow of sitting in the spare points and left the key in the ignition. It was even raining hard. But I was only 20-200 miles from here. Let's cut our hair and it's not  sitting. Zoom. and there's an surprise setting me. Coming up what the Park Service has against problems and a place that's so hot and humid even the crumbs get sweaty That's in a minute. I'll be very information This is American Life on the grass. You should gonna program my course and choose some theme when you're a variety of different stories in that movie. There's program. what we did this summer. Stories of mind, altering body, stopping corporate inducing heat. We've got to do a 2-hot program at 2. This is a new season. during the hottest days of August, during the Chicago, down at the Goldstein saw that environment that was yet hotter. It was not how to not be so that yet hotter if you found a place. The Vision Street Russian bath, the place is so hot in humid that literally equipment does not work. There are people who are putting their skin at function. It's literally too cold. Jimmy Kaluchi is sitting bare chest in behind these baths. Grabbed only in a tiny one it's shoot. And there's something about it that's. says there's a better way than this. But wait, that's more brazen, more comfortable, and quite frank, more neat. Jimmy's the owner of the Division Street bath, and his office is right upstairs to steam. He's just come up from his daily sweat, and sitting there and his desk dressed on the sheet, he looks  the guy who does paperwork and the pharaoh. When I asked him what makes the heat and his bath has so special, he tells me that he provides a heat that's different than anything else offered around the country. unfolded, but he'd be able to tell his heat from other heat? Absolutely, he says. But what about the other time? We hear so much about, I ask, the kindness cost to fold it and unbearable. The kind that causes the elderly to drop by flies in the young screen of their boyfriends, just because they got them wrong kind of sandwich. I don't make that a hundred feet, Jimmy answers. To better understand the power of this heat, Jimmy sends me down into the steam, the towel, the sheet, and the bar of soap. First I shower, the wet sheet around my waist feeling so wrong, gets a right. I ask myself, how does one comport oneself, clothes, and only in a sheet? a stoic Roman senator? A pot with a re-of-sheemying down a blue-war dreampipe. I decided to plunge one hand around the tide, not to play a situation comedy guide, a lot of time, but how's rapin' welcome? The place has the all-visness utilitarian look of a boy low room, crack concrete, aisles, and meldowy wood. And then Jake appears. He is a small Jewish man from the old country. He is naked except for his flip flops, old jean, con son, and which he keeps driinched in water. Last week, I ate a big thing of spinach, Jake informed me by way of introduction. I ate  a pig. I ate me diarrhea for two weeks. Then the... gave me something for that, and now I'm constipated. He pauses the deep to allow the iron to be absorbed. When he's not in the bathhouse, Jake wears two hearing aids, without them he can't hear a thing, so he talks and I listen. Over the sound of the shower and the echoing voices, finally catch beds. As we talk, Jake moves closer and closer, and as he does, I slowly unconsciously hinge backwards, and finally, a minute barner's under it. shower with Jake and we are chastity chastity. Even though his mouth is only a couple of inches for my ear, I can't continue to catch my leg pieces of what he's saying. 45 years, he foreshots a whiskey after the shit. 7-8 robes I used to rub. I can't remember the last time I spoke to anyone so close. The Jake's so comfortable with it that it makes me comfortable sick. People just don't talk  this. It makes me feel  I'm in an old photograph. The water falls down on us, and it's  there's two sleepwalks called the end-foo chair of the summer room to settle. It all feels green and long enough and Jake's taking me and I'm glad I'm here. Right here, this is life's trick of all the fans. It's the best part of being a gym. It's wet, how it any is the exercise in it. It's probably even the best part of prison, the showers and fresh suns. I didn't know so far as to say that this would be the best part of hell, as you step into first blast of soothing the light. So we said, who is sweat? It's what we do. It's  we have an assembly line production home. We sit all financial home and browse and stay around for a wondrous fire intense. We are engaged in serp. business. So what it makes us feel productive,  we're doing good work and getting things to accomplish. Jake's younger son Willie calls me no one. He's giving a large hairy man in the size of an oak leaf brush and wants me to see. Have you ever seen a real Russian-style massage as well as the naked 300-pound man calling on his back that he's attending to a wide-duty racism slags in the air. Baby, perhaps be diving. Willy lifts the brush over a shoulder and brings it down between the man's legs, over and over. He does this with a kind of casualness that suggests whipping a naked man in the pie that's is the most normal thing in the world. And I watch them completely and utterly freaked out, which is I think the result really was fun. The men in the bathhouse watch from the Sasha one get massage  it's teeth,  they're watching an information when there's nothing else better on. And then suddenly, and by suddenly, I mean not sudden, because everything down there happens as those similar to cherry sauce. They are all pitching in, and you can't tell who works there, and who doesn't. They're all over some guy, just for the thrill of doing the job right. And then most of the buckets, sitting in the heat, the old men take old fashion buck. the ice-boed water and dumped the mochery shutters heads to cool down. Seeing this is  stumbling into a long running performance of the world's oldest joke. It reminds me of how when I was seven, by grandfather and a remnant of such old country playfulness, dumped the bucket of garden for his water over my head and family barbecue, and how I spent the rest of the afternoon off, traumatized and genuinely spasped out, bowing ispering again as well... and he's sick. Jake and his sons invite me upstairs to eat. Dressed only in our sheets and towel if we sit around the table in the dining room off the locker room and we eat. Eating bear chest at home by yourself makes you feel  you've simply given up on my life. They're eating bear chest at an room full of other bear chest and man makes you feel you've got my mother's three thoughts. Jake pulls out a plastic container and pulmet airing. I made that. He says, hoping he's fingering from the case on my... We pass around bread in club soda, big silver bowls of salad, steam baths out, it's all in the menu, roasted on the wall. There's also one called garbage salad. These are the kinds of names men give for foods. This is what all of life would be  if you were a world of all new men. In a world of such men, a hearty with sprouts on out bread would be called a footset. There's simply too much work to be done and no time to invent clever names. Give me two feeders. side of garbage, they might say, after a 15-hour day of breaking farm soil with their fingers. We want your Clint Eastwood movie, on an enormous screen. We read magazines while talking about other movies. We let our stomachs pour over what, wood that we were wearing pants, beer belt buckles. It is a world governed entirely by testosterone. Oh, I'm not talking about the chest pain and the loudmouth testosterone that gets in much breast-free days. I'm talking about the other kind. moments, the gentler, more utilitarian illness. The unsolved conscious they've making the keys with a playing part, get up the last 3D bits and roasts move to time for me. In old man passes our table on his way downstairs. As the heat, he asks. Hot! I answer. You think this is hot? Wait till the Russians come. So show. He lifts the shoe from around his way. and wipes his mouth with his teeth. I've been hearing this all day, everywhere I turn, people are talking about the Russians. Their massicists, says a grain, fire hydrant named Seymour. Where's the enjoyment in breathing 180-degree heat demands water buffalo of man named Gussie? When the Russians come, the insides of your nostrils will feel  lit matchsticks. It has to do damage from the bronchial passage. I'm told they come on Fridays, and I decide to go to. Suddenly, feels as though all the fact of my life had been leading up the moment where I passed out in a scorching room full of naked Russians. What should I do to prepare, I ask? Go home, turn on the oven and stick your head here, so it says. I imagine in descending the stairs, these Russians, single file, sliding each other on back, rolling hot poles between their fingers. Each one man in. and thermostat. They pass buckets of water down the line  a sandbag and a dam. They throw heat  gods,  bolts of heartburn. You can't touch your own skin without eating finger-sized wells. I imagine winning the mojo with my amy mulltons. It's  a refrigerator in here, I'll say. Perhaps we should build some shelf store open jars of maintenance. Had I known you gentlemen came here for the tepidness and not the heat, ever brought a cup of hot cocoa on the shelf. straight across my lap. So I come back on Friday to see the Russians and it's hotter but only moderate. The men sit around the same in different. An old man who I'd  to think his rush sits in the corner of Russians' teeth and his finger. And then something possibly strange happens. As I sit there wondering, the old man on the walker. from the set and finish off his teeth, good and proper, flossing. Out of the steam, emerges the tall naked body, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, and no one gives him a sentence. Bath people truly don't. And even if they did, it would be too hot to be ready for the power. They treat Jackson the same way they treat everyone, pleasant and different. They watch his arbey, one of the pages wounds. works a lot in much the way they watch anyone else getting the sun. But perhaps out of respect they do not get you in an app or it's in the dining area. The Reverend has the way of preserving us  everybody else. He stands naked at the camera trying to catch the monkside. The cook sees him and continues to stir in the mess of obviously, and then finally becomes the work. I'd  to cheese toast to the San Francisco. Real cheese cheese toast isn't good anymore. Cheese with Keith Jackson with taste. Real cheese, the shirt and chef. I find out afterwards Jackson often comes from badminton's. In fact, I'm told that when he got back from Bosnia, he came in for a sweat, and as he passed through the dining room, 20 odd men in the sheets and bathed house all rose up, without saying thing, even a sand even ratio. And then, wordlessly, they went back and had meals. When I leave the bath house, the 90-degree heat outside feels surprisingly cool and refreshing. It's the middle of August in Chicago, and yet the streets feel air conditioned. It's  being freed from sweatbox and relaxing and sweatbox, and I am a newer. I stole home feeling comfortable and good. I ran the corner onto my street. I see the fire hydrant across from my house is open. and neighborhood kids are jumping around in the street. Brothers carry their sisters kicking and laughing into the water. Little kids run out in the gym. At home, my girlfriend Heather has just put her daughter Arizona in bed. If we wake her, she'll probably remember it for the rest of her life, I say. And so, we wake up her soon. Outside on the street, Heather says she's never actually seen an open fire hide from except for the movie. When she says this, it makes me realize. See. Aerosone erupts the state from a rising lens and fluttered in the middle of my view. She jumps in beside a large woman bathing a small dog and dressed  a few rooms. It feels  the whole city is heading cool for a while, and Aerosone does not know when to start. She jumps in and holds scenes on the buildings of her program in the upper of a funny and kind of great novel, part of any bruises. Because it's to So, I have three, you can have your page and eat there too.

In this fun is really thing I am not alone where I have sat on. picnic tables among my countrymen some of me stood down the Nazis and we smile at the landscape and at one another the grease trickling on to our souvenir t-shirts. Paging through a guidebook entry on New Mexico's Carl Fatt Caberns National Park, the words underground lunch room caught my eye. The lunch room is... It's a smack dab in the middle of the cavern, 750 feet underground. The guidebook warns, modern eyes, this strange installation seems absurd, but moves to close it down, have been stiny by its place in popular affections. So I come to find out, it is a restaurant so oddly placed that it requires an active congress repeated every year to keep it flowing. If the geological maricals of South Africa have been in the time before history, the Underground Landtrume represents the time before a route go up. First established in 1926, a country was renovated in the 1970s and it shows. The food and souvenir station are. in sandy ground foods that remind me of the drive-through bank architecture of my child's food. The food, box lunches, a pole chicken or ham sandwiches, wedges of pie, in plastic wedge shaped containers, is a sort of fair, my great school washed down with chap de cola on the vegan trade field trip in 76. Not long after the bisoned canyel, middle American started eating better and dressing fed. and calling nature, e-environment. Of the underground lentil is a throwback to our unpretentious, if un-lightened past. The National Park Service wanted to get rid of it. In 1991, they began an environmental assessment of the lentil. Money was spent, scientists confirmed to took two years and sadly for them, they were unable to find any inclusive. evidence that food particles, crayon gaff in the refrigerator or the use of microwave ovens were harming the ecosystem incline it of the cake. In fact, all sorts of things pose a bigger ecological threat to the caves than the one trim does,  the distance of lights of an elevator, a actual bacteria carrying tourists with their lint covered clothing. In the end, the reason the parts service wants to close the lint room doesn't happen. to do with science. It has to do with aesthetic. In the year since the country was built, we as a people have gone through a grand, tectonic shift in the way we think about national parts. Basically, we don't believe in putting crap in the middle of nature in more. And we believe in taking out as much of the old crap as we can. This was codified in 1991 part service policy called the Veil Agenda, which clearly states. The National Park Service should use existing authority to remove wherever possible unnecessary facilities. Well, we're standing at the big room of lunch and this is where the naturality is. It's the aesthetics of all this that Ed Green talks about when we walk through the cabaret and he makes the case for the removal of the lunch room. Green is in charge of visitor services at Calls that Taberns National Park. He contributed to that environmental study. And he spent so much time underground amidst the marbles of the cabaret that he has a separate name for the world that you and I inhabit. He calls that world the surface world. I started to describe this before someone who can't see it, because there is nothing in the surface world of experience, the air is completely. See something  this. This is one life anything else on earth. There will be time. arms that I will intentionally, if I am having rough day or something this, getting in the mask and little bit out of this intentionally, come down and take you in a band of place, sit and sit this up. This knee sore, this kind of knee, keeps me hungry, keeps me in the right path, to do the things that I need to do. Nobody created probes that happens so they could have lunch, seven minutes and 50 degrees feet on the ground. If you walk down through the natural entrance, what you are experiencing is this natural creation and then as you exit out of that area and you walk into this area, this is start contrasting. that's the first thing you see when you walk out, when you're coming to one of the world's great maps with attractions. greatest attraction in all creation in what you see. They do not look  a... maybe a mall, see you here. If the park service reading for removing the underground lunchroom is essentially an aesthetic argument, the main reason to save the lunchroom is equally aesthetic. Namely, it's called to eat lunchroom a cake. You can also mail a postcard from a lunchroom in stamp it, mail 750 feet underground. It's entertaining to mail a postcard in a cave. The lunchroom even has a thank-of-s-pay phones. Why would you need to make a telephone call from the cave? Well, you wouldn't need to. You might do it because it's fun in your on-fankation and you're at a place with the word cart in its name. The cart was bad at this. this community partly depends on vacationers for their livelihood. So, when the National Park Service announced their plans to remove the Underground Lentrum, the Carl Fad Chamber of Commerce, opposed them. Gary Perkowski is the mayor of Carl Fad. a lot of locals, he also worked in the Underground Lentrum as a teenager. He was one of the people from Carl Fad who argued the Lentrums merits before one of the new Mexico's congressman, representative Joe Scheme. Well, I think Representative Scheme was not our son. He works very closely with the leaders of the Carlson and the Moon's brothers. And we just went to Washington to explain the opposition of what we thought. And he agreed with this. That's him? That's basically it. He agreed with our position and did everything he could to make sure that that was implemented. Also, I'm ready to now from the following legislation prepared by Representative Scheme. to mid. According to HR-227th, the Department of the Interior and Related Agency's Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002 Section 307. None of the funds made available by this Act may be obligated or expended by the National Park Service to enter into or implement a concession contract which permits or requires the removal of the underground lunch room at the car. House Bad Caver's National Park. That is the same language that is appeared in every appropriation bill since 1994. And what it means is that the National Park Service is barred from using federal funds to close down the underground lunchrooms. Calls to representative Scheme's Office for Commit or not return. The National Park Service is awaiting the will of Pungent the will of Pungent. but you don't get to feeling they're all that happy about it. If the part service were a person, the underground lunchroom would be one of the dumb mistakes it made as a kid. It's  Congress is telling it that it not only cannot remove the tattoo, it got one grunked in night in the 20s, it has to invite 300,000 people a year to look at it. And that's how a lot of employees think about it too, as a youthful gap. Specialist Ron Kerbo, who was one of the... of the study calling for the lunchrooms abolition remembers going there when he was lit on  any year old I thought he was the University of California remember the pickle he used to have the shell, a little paper cup, all paper cups with pickles and he could eat as many of those as you want it so I was always very fond of the pickles and charging Till he says, there's no reason for the lunchroom today. Food is available to tourists in a restaurant that's just 57 seconds away by elevator. And for all the visitors who enter the cavern through the elevator, the lunchroom is the first and the last thing that they see. And then it's gone. And the lunchroom is the visitors experience. When you're at airfelt, did you feel marred? While yes, as child, I ate in there, and I enjoyed it, and I did read it. But I have moved on to make great things with the National Park, because if we are a tune to these mapal processes, and we can move on. If you are only memory of Prophet's ever, just in the lunch room, and you have... Smith, the guest of the experience. Everything he's saying is true. But when I got at the phone with him, I was really frustrated because my only possible counter-architect is that the underhand lunchroom is really weak. Or it's a big, heavy in that. Since the lunchroom does no significant harm to the cavern's ecology, I'd  to believe that this is one of those. what these places where we don't have to choose between doing the right thing and enjoying a goose. I spent a couple hours walking down through the cabins and this is what I saw. I saw 14 football fields of treasures, things with names  Witches, Finger, Poodum poll, earlate, formations described as hot pours and soda straws in places called the Bony Art or the Hall of Giants. I don't know how to describe the magnificent of Karl's Bad Phaverns without making it sound  a cartoon, or a drug trip, or a cartoon of a drug trip. The only thing I can say is that it is one of those fear places that make love the world. So when I came to the end of the last trail, I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye to the caves. I felt all dreamy and I didn't want the feeling to end. I look up at the ceiling of the Lantern Witches of... course the ceiling of the cave. It looks so lunar I can't help but thank you for certain ask or not. In 1971 Apollo 14 Allen Shepherd hit golf balls on the moon. Steering up to face the profundity of the universe this man brought sporting good with the mendous face. You can blame him. Ask what we Americans do when we find a place that's really special . We go there and act exactly ourselves are a nation of fun-loving goats. I sleep walk to a picnic table in the underground lunchrooms. And I first read about the lunchroom in the guidebook. I'd never suspected it to feel so contemplative. Then I rip up in a bag of barbecue potato chips and listen to the sound of my own keep crunching. It is possible in the lunchroom to chew in pond or at the same time. Sarah Vales, a good book. Thank you for watching.
