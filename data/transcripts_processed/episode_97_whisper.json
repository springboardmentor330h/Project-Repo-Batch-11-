  "text": "Not long ago, I went to see something, got fast cheap and out of control, hadn't ready to refuse to meet at once. Didn't know anything about it, except it was by Ero Mars, that made you film makes you work for it. And the friends of mine enjoyed. And it was great at funny moments and fun moments, characters totally satisfying so . And every movie I'm walking through, theater lobby, and I see the poster from the way. Which I somehow missed on my way here, was a bright and bad yellow. The main characters in the film were called the Grapp with this fish eye lens, so the heads are huge and the bodies are tiny. They're in big print posters as these were it. The bizarre at its best. And I realized what was going on. Someone somewhere thought this film was , I think I thought they would sell it as , which if you see the film is astounded. It's a great film but it's not  there's a whole section in the own or there's is the one... Yeah, meditation on death, it's not . Tom Bernard is one of the co-presidents of Sony, picture classics. He saw what a great film, as Chief Natto Control was, and bought the distribution lights from Omar's in the background, at the Sundance Film Festival. It was, he says, the only quiet place to get anything done, that competitors are everywhere. And he says, the marketing film is likely for a simple reason. What is it? I could film a swacky people come to see it. Well, I mean to me, one of the ultimate wacky fellows on the blue is Brazil. And what was the salad, I don't even remember that? What was that? She's the bizarre campaign, the sort of a South American lettering style, , who had Brazil, wacky lines and colors, we had a movie club, which was, , a very, very moving cell, but, ... It's easy to talk about our crumb guys of wacky guy. Even in the company of men was very dark comps. It's a movie we released and it's a campaign. It's a bit strange. It's wacky. I love you've seen these films but they are every single one of them. they have very dark films. These are bleak thoughts, really. I suggest Mr. Bernard that wacky seems to miss a lot of what this is. Now, he said, no, no, no, no. Look at the four characters in past Chief and Out of Control to them are scientists. Once, exponent robots on the world's leading authority on naked mole rats, is a lie in tamar, this guy, who curves trees and bushes into the shapes of animals. And, Mr. Bernard, that is, by most people's objective standards, actually, kind of wacky. I had the film is a very strange film that people are very strange. I think in word of mouth people would talk about it and they say, look at these crazy guys, let's go see what they're up to. , everyone says we talk. Is that I guess I don't think of people as well. I guess some people just think of people as well and something. I mean, when I think of all the people in the ceramics or my think of our crime, I mean, I think of them as being people who are fundamentally very, very serious. Do you see them as crazy crimes or eccentric, , eccentric guys or wacky guys? I think they're very eccentric and very wacky and, , I think that if  people in the ceramics or wacky guys, in your world that you consider genius, and I think these guys are all geniuses, what they do. They sort of have a view that is so focused and so would people call Albert Einstein, eccentric? Without respect, Mr. Nard, it was hard on concern to do in God's work, distributing these unusual, interesting, amazing films. With our respect, I have a tip on you, and it is pleased to have this time. Why are you to me? To miss the point of everything you can stay. Why do you eradicate empathy, thoughts, feelings? Why do you use people saving their two people  to save freak? Why do you use people saving their two people  to save their two people? Why do you use people saving their two people  to save their two people? When you call somebody, why do you ignore it? You're ignoring it. And painting a big smiley face on top of the real things. , I didn't use to happen to paint them. That's why I can use one way or another. expression sounds cheap and art control. And that opinion, step what, that what. And then we started putting this week's program together, this week's radio program. And everything I thought about why, that's going anywhere again. Well from WV fashion. American Life Clare Glass. Today on our program, 13 ways with me to whack. Heck one, negative. Ready to David Cedera's face is a sheet of glass, glass milk or carpet tax, and tiger fur with big, big ideas. Back to, good the bad in the wacky. We squint our eyes, try to distinguish good catch from bad catch, good wacky from bad wacky. Actory, the politics of wacky. A conversation with Michael Lewis about Republicans, the press, and course . whikiness. X4 through 10, well, see that there's. After 11, self-proclaimed whaki. We find someone who is not called whaki, but marketers, voters, which cost yourself less. 12, side-stepping whikiness and seriousness, and embracing vote, at 13. Dr. Jack one is to whaki. That story from around zero value. Stay with us. At one negative. David Cedaris is a regular contributor here on this American life, I'm running into the Chicago Commentator, author of the book's Naked in Barrow Feaver. His story to the sort of complicated mix of seriousness and funny that it's easy to love, but comes nowhere near and has to say nowhere near to whack. What follows is a set of true stories plus a fictional story inspired by the book. I warned my new guy to be sacked in his photoshoot. It was an extravagant purchase, but I justified him thinking of all the money I would have spent on to icing quite had a real job. I thought the magazine would want to picture it from the standing with my book, so I packed a copy of all of the next brochure in case I had something to do with the dance blank. I lied to the studio with the photographer said, I'm not loving that time much at all. He didn't cap the shirt either. and called out to his assistant, Brian? Hey, Brian, do we still have that t-shirt from last week? The t-shirt was produced and I explained I'm in Kate and I'm wearing anything for a song. Especially the words, the lyrics of the year. You are gay, aren't you? God for us. It says right here, you press,  after a long person. When it came to wearing that t-shirt, most definitely had wrong person. Or maybe you can turn it inside out. said, we will be seeing much of it anyway since I'd  to get you crouched down on your hands and knees. Seeing is your an author at all, I thought it might be fun, we shot you cleaning the bathroom floor, the black, white tiles and through the green. So what do you say you changed out of that shirt, we get started? Then you called for a system fill up a bunch of such a lot, adding bubbles on top should be as fast as possible. As professional photographer, I have to say it's way too great as that's for my tenacity months, that's humor. These are the tools I use on a daily basis because it's not just knowing how to operate a camera, it's also knowing how to get into a person's head. No, really can't. out for a while? I'm not saying this, but let me give you a little example. After she won the poet surprise, everyone thought about the English. Some sort of a genius, which is fine, but you could tell she'd really let it go to her head. It wasn't physically huge, not  a medicine ball, but you could see that she had this false idea of her own value or whatever. This is something a person  me can spot right on the bat. I have just  my sense of humor in my tenacity. I'd see her picture a few of the weeklies. She was always, I mean, she was always in front. what I mean? Just sitting there, proc that against the sofa cushions with a quill in her hands. Terrible. They put you right to sleep. That's how it is when we're talking for caves in the summer, and some of these claimed this very, very empty. destructive sense of dignity. She clearly likes to play the grand duchies, but me, I'm working for something , some nutty jump off the page saying, this is first crazy or what? I mean, people  that. It's a kid. I mean, it easy to take a picture of an actor because they'll just do anything for you. , excuse me, Mr. Cutty. But do you think you could maybe dip your head into this cold or in a steaming cocoa? And before I can tell, I'm gonna need to wait a while and let it cool down. I look up, guys, already done it. I mean, there he is. It's skin peeling off and sheets. And he's there asking if he should do it again because if that's the way actors are, they're not calling out the hounds or love-ring to their publicists because they know how to cooperate. What? Hi! There's no problem whatsoever, but get yourself a politician or anyone owning a typewriter here in the first class headed because these key and egos  he would leave. You can make another round here. Yeah, thank you. You're lovely individual. I told myself I'd probably be more aggressive and stand up in the suitor. So far isn't working. I'd  to ask if they've read or even seen on the vlog, the questions sound snoddy. I understand that they're busy peeping. I'd just  to know why they think I said we picture and drinking tea and stop the squirrel, or create a little massage can of food content. I've never written about our own business. My theory is that if you're good looking, they'll dress you up and embarrassingly try to close, but at least the loudest stand up right. It's too happen to be on the plane. inside that come up with a gimmick designed to make you look in worse and worse. To complain is to insist against all reason with good luck, and that's even more embarrassing than going along with a humiliating little scenario which is eight on the same sub-parade. Today's talk for studying me for a few moments before asking you if I brought enough of changing clothes. With the help of this assistant, he then proceeded to climb a large sheet of glass through standing metal frame. Once the window was securely in place, he asked the assistant for a carton of milk. Then he looked at me, took a sip of the milk, and spat it out on the glass. What I want you to do is to press your face against that milk stain. Really smash it up against me, as hard as you can. When I hesitated he said, don't worry, the glass is going to fall, we might share it It is mine, this was my own concern. So, the servant has walking this panel off this bug room to please your bad head, those of the lab glasses, people wear when you want to look slow or something. Now, I don't know which is. I wonder how can you turn this into a little fumb? because hey, I'm not professional too. I deserve respect, but my very playfully suggested it might be funny to shoot her dress as anti-mime on. So, at a time, the woman hit my head right off my shoulders. Not literally, but, , with a figure of speech, and I'm a smart person, so when she refused an anti-mime, I figured she had some sort of a way dish. Yeah, I'm sensitive as the next guy. I can ask what I said. Alright, what if he shoot you as Chrissy gone with the wind or maybe I don't know, mom's made she was thin? I was trying to work there, maybe , have some laughs but she automatically assumed this, this, this, this. I don't know what else to call you. Look what you're sucking on a handful of chains. It's just hard. It's a hateful face. For no reason whatsoever. But, me, see, I've had nothing. I've been having this long term. And I knew there was no way I was going to be that long. Because if nothing else, this business is tough. How? How? How did ? And I... Stop. what I mean? All the psychological crap that makes them ticker whatever. So when body finger to refuse to dress  you, she might not know or moms, I suddenly got an message. Underneath all the praise, all the hoop she was shaped . And it was , , I'll do light when on my head. It was , thing though. I always thought there was nothing worse than a tech-reverse, and that was before I meant to say talk. Because we're busy trying to open this play, I asked if he would mind coming to be theater. He set up his lights in the base, and greeted me saying, Hey a little car on you. Clap the ride percent. I said yes, I smoked and he had to me a package, not on the cigarette, the design he looked as though he was dead. I wanted to put these in your mouth and say, not the individual cigarettes with the whole package. Here were maybe three cigarettes altogether, but what would the cardboard backing, the plastic cover, packaging, size and one of them is so curious to show that I'm not It was a tight and nasty tasting tip, but whenever you complain, the target comes out you're ruining not just the day to their entire life. This is their livelihood and who you are, spoiling and humanity. The underlying message is that they're doing your thing. Here you'll be in a magazine. People will read about it, maybe by and walk, shouldn't you be grateful? I thought of the people in my Bible for a few stunts picture, and then I withdrew the information, might help. I thought I explained myself very well. If you talk for God's be someone who's not an old right place, before saying, what if we get relying on the ground instead you want to? That might be from what do you say? That's what I'm talking about. So, I'm pretty good. Great options. She said, I could either photograph her standing beside the wall. Seated what I thought was very pretentious. Desk made the hatched ghost. Or else I could leave. Huh. Can you beat that? She's telling me what to do. Now, I wasn't about to lower myself to her left. So, I let her think that. Oh. she really wants to go on and I said, where will she fall asleep? She's starting to stand by the wind. So, she takes her pose, not to talk to two or three roles. And I have my seat next to her, but she's just to see what would happen. That's... are we talking about a good lunch? What was noise in the shatter glass or eyes I swear on my mother's grave.... The size of a Carcomb... I'm pastter, i have her mouth closed up and this perfect little circle was just tri- I mean the word oppresseless doesn't even give me a justice it's one of those when  for certain that there isn't a god. He's actually playing on your team. No questions asked. So, I got the whole thing on film. Just past the cast. I still just last night I looked at it. Maybe my son's stomach was left, he's so fucking good. Yeah. The happy shot. I took the best picture back to his team. And he was the son. So, what I did was talking to his student. Race. , you need this flower in place whenever I got it at them out. You replace them with the field of water, just squinching. Ah, ah, forever. Because I hope they just squee-man, but in good way, because I don't know what you're asking for. Man, it's action. You're a virtual person. The show was, I don't mind. I was pretty, so trust me. I was pretty, so I was pretty. that mind. One, eight, two, one, four, one. Two, one, four, four. Kind of certain people. The magazine site put it on the cover. Once it came out, finger-to-crown, ass, and her majesty go five-page hate letters. His team is smelling her, is funny. She wants to continue publishing these books, but she really needs to write up her has name on. So you're taking these two series of actions. Causing me. No, I mean, stuff  this goes to Arizona. The incident was about the news diaries to be very quick photographer. Amy's Garus, a quick form of sound Amy's. for active with best black blacky cells and blacky's big son new character with real shoes 19 to be free subindo lunchbox small to be sure blah blah nothing at all have to do break the mass which is thanks And is that always bad thing? Is it always somebody's single marketing? Is it good marketing? I think they're a wacky, I do believe that. I'm talking to wacky, I agree with you that you've been used all over. Just Glenn is editor of firm not, and he writes his pop culture in Oxford. And we ask him for guidance, distinguishing good marketing. Good marketing, bad marketing. Consciously, we want to understand that we have to begin with. some products and books. In the classified as wack, the things that create a unique wack. Autistic contents and songs that create two or earnance. Soots. And then to the other end of the scale, there are things that created in the house that would each be wack. That's that. You same  both bunny cartoon. Jim Carrish will read that of Samler. But that's how it was created wackily and meant to be received wackily. And that's how it was. You don't have a problem with that. No, I  how the family was a lot of hate you carry, but how the family was great. Black is done really well. three studios,  the white club, I was a kid. , , what? So, that's a black. It's interesting, because it's an every kind of opportunity for the different we use. Black used to study, better, black used to study work. Yeah. Now, here's the thing. And here's where I think the out of black is confused with the black in our culture. Well, I'm the way. Ray, the cultural product created and whether it's saved up, he don't always line up to the threat. So, he created with great deal of fairness, and might really fail, I would try to do. But let's see what's against him. He could  Edward, who is it? Last example, right now he was joking, made my mind not to say this. He was trying to make my fixed feet up, to get moving. I don't know if he thought he was trying to use fairness, but let's see how that works. with us reading the title of the name. It was very hard to perhaps make a good time fiction. It failed greatly for these terrible directors. However, he had a really original vision. And he worked as being wack. He worked as just trying to split our eyes that Washington looked and came carried. Everything that's out of whack is not wacky. So when we're going to the video store and Edward Movie and Packers whacky. talk with the wacky vision that would on the back cover. Now that's aggravated. When my first face is wacky, , I came out to the garage, probably wouldn't, I didn't feel  last week. Having a sort of paper somehow, you think? I guess. I'll create a, strictly calm way about the story, whatever. I'll have to write a movie that's wacky. If I was, you could get it to the story. Whatever. I think you can all type of the lack of education of American culture, where we're really not allowed anything that's between artists and really. One of course, look at all of the cultural products that are meant to be taken very seriously. It's fine to find out how a lot of that program or five-view of all of that, moving our insanlar representatives are not available at all. I feel that failed period. There's a present in New World. Mia, remember? Ava is an apple of failed period, but their music is not going to be fine. It's been  overly passionate, overly tripping with emotion and mentality in a way that we find and where it is now. Now they met and they said, you could sort of engage with the way that they would try to do it. So, you go flat and you can be very blue-five and then that's your village. That's the end. Right? And you hear the thumbs and then low. I remember long, long and long, and that's the night that we're in. In the sky, light and the man-dove. Josh Klan, Zesse and the latest this year of Permanente, which is between two reactions to whiteness which is to reactions. Kim, and bloody emotionally engaged with Dance, achieves with her. Which, nearest, then? We hope you are much just a lot. We have a lot of concerts we would do next and all are being out of place. For 2019, dance,繞 bold and mixed. let's work playoff fever soon with adequate book or lawyers, poker or bad solution. Also, from the campaign trail, you notice the candidates who tend to have any regional ideas on candidates who would most usually but yes. I think that it's not just the public, but it's also in big business. I think you find that anybody who's got the ring of all, anybody who behaves, the way real you behave, being behave in a contact where a bell in our cage is next. have the struggle for power gets tagged with being lacking your being on beat or on ball. I mean, there's nothing more alarming or dissonant in national politics and politicians that have felt the truth and talks  a ordinary human being talks as opposed to the way a national politician talks. So let me ask you to give this all for. But that was more a terror. He was just got... I was going to come out of the classroom and I was building a half-dollar company and his workers at the door to do it was qualified in every way really to be talking about some big problems to say to the country. But he was, because he was funny because he was, he didn't take himself with a partner all too seriously. He got, he got tagged and he, he's going to a lot off the, not serious. So he talked, he was the only guy I met in the whole campaign job is writing for off. talk the way normal people talk and who made sense to me in a little way. And yet, besides before that reason, he was more in the back, not to be a serious contenter. That sort of person could get left in front. And he had serious issues. The other thing that is right here is that in fact, he took his ideas, he stripped him, waft and pulled the idea. is. If you were key, you'd be clicking the door. Say we want that button. But it's  one of the door platform. It's platform. It's perfectly acceptable. It was that he was being presented. The problem was the net. The net was a real person. And that's not what he did in the following. You don't allow to be funny. You never allow to be funny. You're always in another way. a lot of things, money went. You're talking, you're also serious, the same time. The joke happened certain times. But money serious doesn't really work. what's the place to joke? A joke is in politics, something you tell us at the beginning of your series of speech. And everybody knows it's the joke, it's the beginning of the speech. It's the one about the free form in the hour. It's not actually funny. It's the ritual joke. But the act is the... That's the use humor is a way of being an idea. That's not the makes-do matter. I remember one of the one of the most people that you've heard about out of a very serious guy. And you've heard about a few anticipated things between Black and Black. Thank you for your time. I thought you was awkward and funny. All you heard was that this crazy black man running for the Republican nomination and nobody takes it seriously. But when you actually got out there, when... Yeah, then you actually went and saw one of the speeches. And with the most extraordinary thing, you was in the middle of the... The dead of a winner in the middle of the snowstorm in the middle of Iowa. And you five hundred fathers turn out to hear Alan Gees. They would say they'd be a third of these speaking. Berry Zero to what people want here and he is yet a single man. That was what America, all you want to talk about is money, money problems. Yeah, yeah. Real problems can bring more money problems, not money problems. You would judge one way or more. And way, that his his his was. , talking to me, burnt day off the walls we talked about. Please. So, I'm sorry now I just play a word for a little bit. But even that, that was it. In fact, doesn't really have places for presidential policy, because it takes three to entertain you. You don't know what this is not what you do. I mean, the funniest candidate, some way, taking both their simplest and cousin response, while I've been taking seriously, we know Reeves is up, and he was, a great songy, and people are too, great songy, exceeding that everything sick. who is our fan right anytime tech start. 斌1.He is right there because people took it something. Record it. Onu ahh medscommittee office. To spread for me she was less stuff as to not fuck you. That was the first place I will talk to You The Truth. CHECK כ Vegetables resin Oh yeah, the anchors, if you really look, they will tell you, oh now we, every now and then they might do something that I joke. And they do about, they do the joke about, I don't know, we get it hard, but it's ugly, we're people, I can get it all free. Whatever it is they're doing something joke story, but if it jokes story, if you're doing a serious story, humor never is a lot of treatment to it. , I think you have why that is. I think it's because he flew in serious business. Big business master politician, now he can lose reporters. One of their great fears is to be taking on serious business. They're serious with their sellers. They can never let that go or down. They let it down and all of a sudden they open the sellers to a different package. Oh, that he's not serious. First, did we actually pay a good price as a solution for this kind of segregation that serious is one, blackness, that is everybody that is classified since it has been done. , you either want or the other, there is very little blackness, super series, that is the purpose, or you just discarded as blackness, including people who look at it very clear that that price you pay is you don't get very honest about the fact that you can't pay that doesn't sound right. Sounding right is all important. Sounding right means being a serious ol' time. Because the second price you pay is even hard to measure. No one that doesn't bring proof the way issues are discussed. It does see why people just poptering and read the things that way is because that's what they're doing. with Michael Rose. Or she will be with her. Coming up, what the truly wacky do with the nation's leading business newspaper, how Peter Jennings can help you evade wackiness and seriousness, and serve out street-card name desire and William Shattner, together in the same story. That's in a minute. Public Radio International. This ad story is an incredibly funny show that introduced its release. This American life marked glass, which we've got to show you, which is deep and it's already sweet That's right. Or rather, this is what I'm writing. There are irrepressible and tab style. That's what I'm writing. This program goes to a web. So, if you're writing. Not all why can't this be created by marketers and merchandises? No, no, no, no. It occurs in nature. Some people simply see themselves as one. Take this person, all. The person is at, is part of the reader. Joining the firm, essential bugs and going in broadest, is never married. Exercise partners also has added prostitution. That's a very powerful fitness whack warm enthusiastic partner. Definitely physical fitness situations, they more. It's a puzzle. I think maybe I'm just a little bit observational. My friends are calling whack. I mean they're basically just not critical. I'm hoping to find it in just very spontaneous person. And I think that's what they really consider which. And maybe also this is a different thing that I'm involved with , yeah, I know I know I know how to speak for language. Wow, oh, , I'll start with a language or I'll listen to some of these conversations. And then I'll just kind of  slide right in and not even always be. And , they're just, they think it's kind of a kind of thing, they were vaguously. sometimes not all the time. The on college was one thing to be afforded to see. And different parties I've filmed. , yes, , , bring your favorite wager. , Wall Street Journal Party or , the timer. Bring your favorite wig or Wall Street Journal. Yeah. That's the choice. No, no, no, no, no. Bring your favorite wig party or Wall Street Journal party or your self-destruct. We went up into the Wall Street Journal party. Oh, you can't everybody bring the Wall Street Journal. the wall street journal and you let each of them all over the floor and the walls and everything. No one of those wall street journal parts too small. And then what happens? And if this all just something fun and maybe I have the ordinary area instead of getting or having a regular party, I'll read a brief copy of the wall street journal and just think journal. And they just tape it up to the walls and wrap it up to the wall and put it on the floor. And then they just tape it up to the wall street journal. What happens after a few hours? No, in a Wall Street Journal part. Do people talk about the Wall Street Journal? Yeah, don't talk about what they've read or what's the app, , how they don't give a difference. The third pet. The app. , I got to say, , that is whack. Yeah. Oh, well. , this kind of person likes being caught whack. Just does something you're pretty common. Yeah, it doesn't bother me. Yeah, they're the next thing and I don't think it is. Yeah. How do you think it's wackiness when people call you back with personal needs? One of the things that we've been told by marketing people in this week show is that wacky cell. And whack, don't worry. And are you finding that true with you? I think that wacky does so. I think that wacky cells because for our soul are free to be wacky. They want to care for the things they have. and make serious about what WEC is all about. And well, that WEC will do things that on WEC people are too bright. So how many responses have you got to hear? I have got probably about 3rd and 5th. Right? I have any of them mentioned the WECs. From here, I mentioned the WEC, yes, yes. They have. That is the only thing that it's WEC. and selling, thinking some more , , fun, sensual bucks , really. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. What do you think? My think I'm not so lucky to put some of these. My attention with is of what was very, and number two, I think he kind of puts people at these and that thinks that , , I'm kind of, , that my style or from various, , various persons that only, , all these perfect men, my, my, my, and then I will put her anybody. Right, essential books. Right, yeah. So, , we have to be one of the hardest part of my pick. Then sell? Yeah, pick? Maria, I have a question. Practical 12, debating blackheat experience. As we said in the show, if you're in certain kinds of jobs, business politics, business, there are lots of jobs actually. And you're funny. You're encouraged to even suppress that side of yourself. We're simply coming to white. You need to be Edward Armero, or Andy. Nobody's not sending any words from the opalance of the bomb series. But in that lens, there are also two avoid the inquisitive either of us. People whose work is series 10, humor and lots of sides. Robert Crowe, which is a story of an NPR and CBS and ABC, are surprising for no one else. I still remember today a big opera called. also interested that he must stay in the 15 years ago when Emperor's office was introduced in poison, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised into actual operatic music to explain and analyze Reagan's. Prowish, just think about trying to occupy this territory that is neither super serious or black, it's middle territory. Sometimes people say we do not know, make, and you stumble into all these unexpected examples one time. and when you're getting a program, it's new. I decided he said we agreed we do a series during one of the Olympics, it's a series in which I think it's in the public insect, right? Chose, the five insects took it out per form, the human champion, by multiple of the least 20 years ago. And it was done with pure joy, which took it very serious. It's very careful to select these strong guys or these fastas, or the best in whatever category it was insect. and then choose the equivalent human being. So what happened the first night of this series shows the script and the task is the script or the very black man. The task is insect, ultimately, a real runoff here between the intelligence of Cornell, University of Illinois, and the research of West Coast, and GT. The one that one was the cockroach. The cockroach is an important system. We have trade meal and there is cockroach going up and asking jumping over a little. It is wonderful to see. And by the way, the cockroach go up on their back legs. They are trying to refurb much their careers. They are trying to refurb much their careers. and I was totally raptured by this thing. I thought that great chilliness, humor, get me's done off his friends. He put it on television. And the lights at the switchboard start lighting up almost me. On Peter's desk, I desk, he light off his head all over the newsroom, black Americans all over the country. Looking at this thing. Straightening these apps on this. On television. that we are just two women. They see the doctor's person. They take a close approach. Very good. But I got so into the insect world, I lost six cockroaches and bad news. I have a bad reputation. So I'm kicking up the phone and one person has another question. If you are in the joy of the moment, you created this thing that you're so proud of, then you're so ashamed by the second call. Soach and... Then Peter Kennedy did this amazing thing. He said, how small. So, yeah, what? Say, well, what's going tomorrow night? I was waiting for him. So, let's check the whole thing. He, when steady said, what's going tomorrow night? I said, well, we have a renasterous people to count the verb Shainee with. Look, this is completely really When he said, well, we have a renasterous people to count the verb Shainee with. If you want to be a person with a renasterous people, you can see that there's a better job in the world. If you want to be a person with a renasterous people, you can see that there's a renasterous people in the world, there's a renasterous people He walks away. No. I don't  this one. So I came on the TV the next time. Sitting there. And first, when it comes to the end of the show, I'm just going to be confused. He likes that. His face just turns  all happened. This is it now. Something really special. A lot of you call yesterday, or you need to share your fascination. I think we're human and relations between species and blah blah blah. And then he says, , almost looking this way. But let's watch this. It had the effect of someone stepping up their own dinner table saying, I cooked this feet low. This tastes this. It would be very bad manners that will not be  what's wrong. But after it was over, he did a non-verbal act. It's very interesting. These eggs and just sits there silently glow it. Whoa we are in this kind. Release sucks in practically nothing. Love the news, love the one. And that act by the king, and this is happening with their season stay and we're gonna get another end to it. They, if they insist that this isn't black, if they say no, I'm the man in the center. I'm the center of gravity here. The center writes this. Then do it. Do it. The calls went 180 degrees different. One people, one, two, and I have. was silent. I think mostly not in the substance of the deceased but two trees display. Robert Crowley, to the corresponding gravy scene news, is currently working on a serious history of the United States called the Ponypony of the U.S. Department. At 13, Dr. Jeff, let's go back.

What easier take the potshots musical over a break-fudge? Then I actually listened to it. Turns out that Naiders work not the Native Arab Civilization Iint.

On WVC, Nader's home station, the annoying music show is heard on Saturday afternoon, my low-sublifter. Magnificent obsession is on at 4.30 in the morning, even Nader sleeps through it. Dmakes ignore crime. You might think Nader would stink well annoyed by the ... knowing shows Darwinian Lee, considering that he says Magnificent Accession is his true passion. No matter how many times you ask him how he feels about that his answer is that it makes sense. He's just so mature. He understands that that's the way the world works. You are. Over-class, I think. People are just... So both children actually are kind of a response. We can be white. It's right there. Absolutely. On my body, then you think I'm sexy. Come on, then our head will be cold. We're in the same. Maybe this way too obvious. But I was thinking about where your two world's pride is. You think you're scared of drugs. And I was thinking, of course, it is what's shattered.

And I feel  hardly that love that is sort of dead inside. , , , there's some- Seneca on yours. Is that it? Is it  the guilt of irony? It's just, it has an ironic show.
