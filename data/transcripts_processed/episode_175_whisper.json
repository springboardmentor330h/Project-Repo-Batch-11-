Parents, dropping off kids, that baby's around. I got it! The money! The money! The money! Oh my God, I've lost my money. I've lost my money. I've lost my money. I've lost my money. I've lost my money. I've lost my money. I've lost my money. That's it! There's no one in Dylan, he sits, but being left at a friend's house, there are two other kids, LA at an Maman, and the regular babysitter, Kristiana, who meets Mr. McGur, but hasn't seen them since before Christmas. He's kids at an Christiana, along with McDonald's almost anyone, four years she's been their sitter, and he turned it. Kristiana takes care of them after school every day, Kristiana is everything about them, and there's such a proposal being left with the sitter, but they don't think twice about it. Mom leaves, look here, there seems. All right. I love you. I love you. Good. Christianis are a serial that belongs to me. Emma is a power-possal, Sarah gets the barbeque ball. And Dylan and Sarah phomem them a difference. Christiana and the other main dataset, Kyle and Sue, in Italia. He's there as call was Christian. When I was a kid. if you want to get away with something, those are these here to get away with. It's Canada. It's Italia. Hi siblings. and those in her house. So then  we say we can drink coke. And that will go. You say you could put your clothes to pet all the time. You're gonna put one more on a good one. And then you'll have some more dry. Mom else and you'll have  clothes to pet. That was for  half a year. I think you would do that to babysitter. And why do you wanna get a pet in your clothes? Because then I don't have to change. It was  changing. She's too much crying. But this guy on that's different. She's  the second mom. I think you guys met there. Yeah. I know them. I've known them since they were also little. And I love them. You  that. I  it. Yeah. And these guys have just been seeing them growing up and growing bigger and learning things. And I'm very, very attached to them. I'm very attached to them. later drop off yet another child. She doesn't use the word mom to describe Christian. Mom, that's her territory. Where she uses is aunt. How do you define this job? Watching children from money. Well today on our program, babysitters and what exactly happens when mom and dad are out of sight are shown today in three acts in the first and older brother babysits and the younger brother is Tower. Act 2 is better and 1988 in the huge companies accidentally found themselves taking on a massive babysitting job because of snow. In that three, if other Instructor get a job babysitting, there's some children we do not exist. And before we say anything else about babysitting first, let's just have a little brief word. Just you and me about married poppins. Let's just say right here, she is the gold standard of all fictional. babies. Maybe if I were real ones too, she is the one that all others are to be measured by. And the movie Mary Poppins, it contains what is probably the classic song about babies say. You remember kids in the film sing about what it is that they want in a babies say. If you want a choice process, have a journey this position. Okay, now jump. Well, see, cheats. No, that's the part I put it in. , let me just stop this right here. This is not exactly the tone that we are going for in today's radio program. Let's cut through the trickle. Want it? Now, if you're too adorable children. If you want it, strike that decision. Have that you want to take my vision. Move it, teach. That was,  games. I'm gonna be a little bit too late to go. I just bet you guys should be here. I'm gonna be a little bit late to go. I have her in your teeth. Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Jane and Michael, thanks. Music recorded for our program by the dishes. I'm just laying by our heads and my seatbelt. at the ancient music studios. Bitcoin's just to act on. That one? What big teeth you have. Hots of babysitting is done by family members. In this first story, parents leave their kids in their teenage son. But a set of acting is a surrogate in the town. Standing above, sibling squabbles and rivalries, acting as judge and mutiator. The teenage babysitter stays squarely in the center of their rivalries. But, as we're learning King, now with no current of forces, temporary exaction. The period grew up in rural Idaho. When their parents went out, the oldest son Doug was left in charge of his four younger siblings. Doug was the kind of guy who ruled the last three rows of the school bus through a combination of force and psychological pressure. He told other kids that the bus driver signed an agreement, putting him in charge of the back of the bus. He wore a bomber jacket. He rode a motorcycle. Michael. Still, his parents thought he seemed responsible enough when it came to his brothers and sister . There was a lot they didn't know. I had to be there, tend to be as big as I was going to make fun for me too, no. Doug got into check of his little brother to what he caused bravery tests. He would do things stuff that means sleeping well and tied them to each other. or snaps huge rubber bands that they're skin until they stop flinching. It really has a tape of television because it could have been, I mean, it's just, well, anything. We had this iguana. Okay, big lids, but it was about 3 feet long, it died. Well, I was so attached to this thing that I just didn't want to take it out. It's very, it's , written the freezer. Kept it. Well, this is a fun thing for all of us boys to take out of the freezer and fly out and play with it. ? And we got tired of playing with it and we put it back in the freezer, , and we freeze it again and after about a year and a half of this We decided we need a new bravy test. So we thought what do you do? I think we should boil and eat Well, and eat the iguana that would be the ultimate bravy test Well, we put it in the pot without the biggest pot my mom had and you stuffed it in there and boiled it, Oh Well, I've been boiling about five minutes, probably done by now. And we've got to sing as in on and on to good at these 28th and that means. Oh my god. I even ate some. And they really, I'm so excited to eat . at that point, it actually tastes kind of  star dust. That did all the bravery tests me. his brothers do, who was right in there with them. But they were on their own when it came to one of Doug's long-running babysitting pranks. I spoke with Doug and what his youngest brother might, who was the easiest target. Their tenure is odd. We were convinced for three or four years of our lives, I think, that he could actually talk with his parents. We would walk out of the house. And it literally stopped your trash. And you just knew it was out for some reason. Again, here's that. We had a pastor in the back, and it was about maybe half an acre. And they'd go out to the back fence and I throw the lights to leave out. So this is a perfect place for me to stalk them in the night, and all and sneak up and be the world. So I would kind of just crawl out into the shadows, and I could hear him. not their talking and I'd be sneaking up to the bushes and my joke. And it's got your dead silence. And then I'd be wondering, how's your life? I've got this up for years and the kids began to thread it whenever their parents want to happen, knowing something scary would happen to them. And so... finally, it all came to a headwind. Mike was eight years old, the middle brothers were 11 and 13, Doug was 18. It began the way it usually did. Out in a pasture surrounded by potato fields. Here's Doug. I had a full moon which was wonderful. I kind of got to where the moon was, was silhouetted me and they couldn't really see me. I stuck a bunch of weeds down in my glasses so they're poking out all around, , and then I kind of look. I was up out of the weed patch, , and make it see the silhouette with all this look  hair poking out, , so that convinced him. I mean, that's totally, I was totally drawing hair. I was completely aware of also, run for your life, you. And we all, of course, knew that the best thing to do is to get out of our sleeping bag run as fast as we could to the house because that was the sheer shelter. What were you afraid that was going to do? Well, it's just the whole idea of being chased by a dark and it's not  there was ever a lack of physical contact and he literally was with a situation where he was scared for your life. And the new that died was in between us and house somewhere. We were running to the house that was the city on the roof. Next to the dark. just a steal is just the long and just just watching. And so we're just going to slow a bunch of walk and we're sitting in the house. Well now I'm preaching in the windows. I'm rattling the doors more. I'm trying to get in and they're running some doors or kind of lock all the doors up. And I was always right under heels as they got as they made it to the door and I made sure that I didn't quite catch them on. We're running a slam at all. Just about the time they thought they were all saved. I just knuckle over and cooked the breaker. I shut the breaker off to the house. And then all of a sudden, the lights get out. And it's pitch dark in the house. It was  this revolving at die. And it was just that they had no safe place. They could think of it. So we go into one of the slammy thoughts. Get to the top. , we've got to get in the car and lock the door. And as we were all sitting there looking around at each other, we realized that my brother's steel didn't make it out of the house. Then the next day I know him in the house, all. Let's introduce another problem. This is Steve. Of course, that then my fear went out through his roof. Right. Then I see him looking at the lap. Well, I... still around back so I thought well Steve is still in there I could see in the darkness I could see him rocking in the chair. Well I'll get Steve. He snuck into the house and he saw my brother Steve to see me. Steve to see me. That was my holding call. He'll be here whatever. He done with it, however you want to end it I've done. I don't think we ever played it again after that point, . These days, the brothers are all quick to say that Doug was playing well, that it was just a game. None of them carry resentment for us in. The one they were kids, clearly feelings were running a bit hot. Around the same time that Doug had his little siblings convinced he wanted their blood. He got into a motorcycle at. that nearly killed him. He broke everybody's face, one on, and one irreplaceable meat. The force of the crash made the helmet, along with his scalp, shoot up his head. It took around 350 stitches to sew him back up. When I came home from the hospital, I had my leg in the calf, my arm and a calf. I was in a wheelchair. My sails were all banged up and that my brother's saved mom. We'll take those down. the road, he's built her for a walk and he can have some errands so she goes okay and I get in the road chair, they get me out on the highway and run as fast as they can and then let go and I'm going down the road in the road, her heading for the ditch and just about the time I go in the ditch they catch up to me and straighten me out and go again so this was kind of the way I did it, he didn't even need kind of a time when I was nothing I did do about it to make it, they had a great fun with me that time. I guess I was protecting a lot of sympathy and, more to, , I wasn't that at all. It would be some revenge for all this kind of thing. Revenge came in other forms as he got older. When Doug had kids of his own, to his heart, his oldest son Corey turned out to be exactly the same kind of baby of the same kind of baby. and said her the death didn't. Doug would come home from the night out and find himself pulling Cory aside and saying things next time try and tie the rope a little looser around your brother's neck. Steve, the brother who told Doug just kill me is also a parent he stays, the poor daughters. And  Doug, he's had moments flashing back to the days when Doug gave his ass. I remember this one time, he came out with his box and he took me right now, Doug. Doug's being. You open this box, has fingers sticking up through the bottom of the box? You can see all you see is this bloody finger in there. I mean I speak out over that year, I still remember vividly, for that reason, stop, I freaked out we were by it. I told us out work. I did it to my own kids, you can do that. Why would you want to speak there? I remember it so vividly and I thought well that was when I think back on it and I go well kind of cool actually how he did it. So here I go and I'm going to try it with my own kids okay and I lift up the box and my oldest daughter just broken the chair. And I've been, I apologize all of myself to the rest of the afterwards. Yeah, hockey. how this Craft your memory of that as I did I think it's first time yeah Did you feel sort of  you were in Doug shoes  you knew what I  to be My pet myself wanted to tease him too  he did In a fun for the way that my wife will give me that just As an adult, Doug has gone to each of his younger brothers and apologised for how he treated them. But he also thinks, if they'd been less aggressive with each other, his kids, they wouldn't be as close now. I know family has gone up more melalina than us. They get a long time in a very civil and they're very happy to see each other, but they're almost  when they see each other they shake hand. And I am , give me it, right? You haven't seen your brother for six months in your shaking hand. I mean, we're grabbing each other and bear hugging and we're jumping up and down and, , it's a whole different relationship, far as I see. people who've been through chromatic experiences together, , yeah, maybe that's why, , you feel you've been through that and survived it all together and so it creates a deep bond, something maybe. So I think we're closer because of it. Actually. Did part of  that when when you were younger that it might. make you closer. Well, , I think maybe subconsciously you do it because after every time you would feel somewhat close. No, so I don't think as a kid you'd have to sit down and think, if I do this, make the closer and I'd rather be just do it, it feels that way. , it can't do the things that make you go closer to that, no other things that we did that the doers together so we can continue doing this. When I asked the other brothers if they do it all over again, they all say they would. Yeah, I absolutely love my childhood. Even with all the terror and danger that was there, you would still do all it over again? Absolutely. I look back on those years with complete pharmacy. No, he's right. She's hosted the longest shortest time of hard-casted battle. This choice position, have a cheer in this position, Rosie Chieks, no walks, play games all sorts. You must be kind, you must be pretty Very sweet, I'm very pretty Take a sound out and give us treats St.Song, bring sweets Never be close On cruel, never give us pasted oil Of cruel, love us as a song and dollar Never give us body one If you will store the dark on the made-ons, We'll never give you reasons you gave us And hide your spectacle so you can't see But towards all your bed, you've happened your...

John Iper the Waco brothers and mecons with John Rice and Mandian and the song with Quiddicoa or a shout whatever we are paying them and it's not enough and this brings us to act to act to in the event of an emergency with your sister in an upright position. On the day of the Christmas, I will cross America, divorce the kids, shut all, from one parent to the other. If they fly, their babysitters are the airlines themselves. This is babysitting in case you can corporate procedure and... corporate language, kids' fine-without adults are caught on a company to miners. What a one-stop-britly-coated tags come to their coats, so hunts and their necks. When you see him, it's hard not to feel bad for them. I wonder what they're going to say about the experience someday when they grow up. Wow. Back in December of 1988, on December 26, divorced kids from all over the country that snowed in at a hear-ear-a-poor-choco. Susan Burton was one of those kids. Now old enough to tell the tale, she and her sister Betsy were traveling from Colorado, where they're mumbling. Mess again. for that grown-up and were the dad with. Who see? There were two types of unaccompanied miners on the fly-side of Denver. Divorce kids and scare kids. You could spot the scare kids because they always wore something to prove they'd been in a Colorado. They had lift tickets spanning out from the zippers of their jackets, or baseball caps that's in bail. But since today was December 26, we suspected that even the boy with a raccoon in face tan. The kind you get from ski goggles was  us. A divorce kid too. Let's see what's up. I slept in, but my thoughts turned to our layout of Rinshikado. That's the end I love the O'Hare airport, with a shiny food court and chain bookstores and big glass A-Tremce ceiling, it seemed  a beautiful new mall. When we landed in Shikado, it was snowing, snowing hard enough to shut the airport down. It was only the middle of the afternoon and it's hours where I'd be deserving sleeping spaces, enjoying the park as of a blocks of chairs, even floor space with stairs. And some people were stuck alongside the moving walkway. The mall had become a refugee camp. The departure board showed that our flight to Grand Rapids was canceled, so we went to the service desk, where an agent took our tickets and tightbills into a terminal. Then she turned on her microphone and sent a cryptic message out of the PA. I had two UMs at the service desk, two UMs at the service desk. Okay, the woman told us, someone's coming by for you. A second woman appeared. and we followed her to a gray and marked door. She fumbled with her keys. As she speathets his hand. The door opened onto a room packed with kids sitting on their winter jackets. There were dozens of kids, all kinds of kids, some small groups, the young ones can burst in with stuff animals, others looking uncomfortable and dresses, or overheated in moon boots that happened to big-depact. Most of them were facing an appropriate amount of front of the room, as if they had been dropped off at the public library, and we're waiting for a meeting. by Shell Silverstein. At the podium, a steward per name on all of us. We'll be sending next to almost wearing a uniform of another airline. This trains us to people from different airlines mixing, almost  something that shouldn't be allowed. There were a handful of folding chairs in the room and we found a three-one year descent. I took the seat and Betsy settled on the floor beside me. She got her baby blanket out of her bag and began to sniff it. It seemed we'd never been around so many divorced kids at once. That comb, most kids had birth parents. If you forget you were different and then you'd be at someone's house at your school, in the dad would come home, and from the landing on the staircase you'd see them sorting through the mail, talking to the mother and the kitchen. It's hard to explain why this was sad. As a result, all that most of our friends knew about our divorce was that my favorite video to rent was Kramer vs. Kramer, and that's these was the parent tab. So now, what's strange to Dr. Kis talking about the things we kept for ourselves? A group nearby was engaged in a kind of divorce people and not friendship. The girl wearing a sweatshirt with a Christmas tree patch said she saw her father on a couple times a year. A boy lying on a stomach line that he saw his dad even less. The exchange of series of anecdotes about step models took a poll who had been the object of a custody battle. It seemed improper to talk so few way about these things. I had no way of expressing this at the time. But it felt  we were part of something on a trans scale. All these kids here in Chicago, at the transfer point between Mom and Dad. Being made by somebody around, is a lot  what you expect. Katie Jen started in now, consulting papers and making shush and noises and yelling out names from the podium. It seemed cluster and no one. Normally they're babysitting. duties were small-scarped. They were getting shepherding kids along moving walkways, and rolling out little pinship  wings. In the U.M. room, they were verted to the same crowd control techniques that they used in flight. Secure the doors with hold information and discourage people from getting up to use the background. So we did what any group of setup delayed passengers does. We started to generate our own information. In the late evening, a room was felt to do the crowd that... The reason some kids were being escorted away, was that their parents were making a bigger fuss than the other parents. Where were those kids going? The question arose from those of us in the land locked middle, and traveled through the crowd. The answer was transmitted back to us by our intelligence force, the station of the podium. Those kids got hotels. Their rest of us would have to sleep here in the U.M. room. The divorce kid reacts to his parents' separation on one of two ways. As I remember about the sleeping owner in the street, it became clear who was her divorce kid who avoided conflict and who was her divorce kid who acted out. Fart noises increased, crushed during boxes began to litter before. I realized that, when grown with sufficient force, under fault could cause injury. Soonward came around that the system had changed, that her babysitter would mad, and they didn't care who your parents were. or how many times they call, now they were taking the good kids first. Immediately, that's your lay down on how blind-hit. I took up the book in my bag, catch her in the ride. Within an hour, we were out of there. By now it was one in the morning. That's the nine-group of others' hall to stewardess through the dim halls. The metal gates were down over the entrance to the food court, and travelers were sleeping in chairs. We were in the chair room too. a lot of people. The first was a girl close to my age, she was wearing glasses with cute pasta tramps. I convinced myself that she was the same girl who'd been a male-lane at swim camp. Years earlier, when my parents were still married, I didn't ask her because I didn't want to ruin it if it wasn't true. The second person was a stewardess who looked about 30. She wore a lot of makeup and she was big bones, packed and wore uniform. She wasn't mean to us that she was pretty standoffish. Is that all? in the bathroom. When the stewardess went into the bathroom, the swim camp girl pulled me over to the window. Curtains were closed but red light shone in from the parking lot. Are you sleeping in bed with me? So I want to have to sleep with the stewardess she said. I looked over at that seat. She was sitting on one of the two double beds in the room, sniffing her blanket. I told her girl yes. It just came out. Almost immediately, I thought awful. When we lay down, I used this part of the edges I could, but I feel nearer to my sister, on the edge of the bed across the aisle. The stories count in the bathroom where I can pull top stockings and a laces slip and got under the covers  that. I'd never seen a girl when we were sleeping in, other than a flannel  down. I wondered if she always looked  that, or if it was just because she had to get up early. Maybe this was what else do you listen to? I understood. uniform, but maybe she just felt awkward. Or maybe there were rules about what you wore that you had to keep covered. Or maybe she just didn't want a bear-likes near Bapsy. I saw Bapsy's ship hern to the covers and curl into a ball. I now felt certain this was the worst thing I'd ever done to my sister. I wanted to strange as we moved in my family of stored. I hated the swim camp girl sleeping next to me. She was up in the street. She didn't have anything to do with my life. On these trips to visit our father, more than any other time, obviously, and I had these each other. I thought of the kids in the U.M. room at the airport, but one saying, cross things about the saddest thing that had ever happened in life. And how reassuring it had been when I looked at Betsy, sniffing her blanket, the way she always had. The way I thought she would forever. Susan Burton. In the Eurison's Ed Story was first broadcast on a radio show a movie based on that story that kids of the voice trapped in an airport of a Christmas was released. It was in 2006. It was kids comedy directed by Paul Feeg. It's got uncomfortable. We have our own suggestions for the new nanny, but you  to hear them? You have my un-debuted attention. I still if you please. If you wish to be our second. Please be sweet and never be to help us with math and book three points. My eye and eat my short fart is coming to the dreamle. If Maggie's bossy don't avoid her, let me get away with more than anyone's his prily and so. And one who will work for me enough of Coming up, how hard could it be to babysit kids who do not even exist? That's in a minute. I'm just talking about the great deal when our program continues. This is a new life in your class. Each of the courses you can theme bring you to the kinds of stores on that thing in this program. babysitting and what happens at mom and dad do not find out about. So, this program is for us for our test back in 2001. We've arrived at Act 3 of our program Act 3. Yes, there is baby. This is really got her interest because Baby sitting but ended up being about so many other things besides. I mean I fired her named Myron Jones where this is later he said, and when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad and buffalo in New York, he was allowed to stay out to a midnight. He came when I was a police, but a lot of time in bars actually, in the 1940s. But this is her carol, she had different rules and she was led out of the house at all. Even though she was older than Myron, this story gets to Baby sitting in a big, big way and I caught him talk about it. She had to say exactly where she was going. She was going with She could go to Church deaths but only some church deaths It all had to do with with protecting her Chested Yeah, it would be if one were to ask you mother that I love which is she she said You gotta be more careful with a girl. Yeah So PR and EG and A&P. So my sister figured out a little scheme. She invented a Sam called him Priyze. Said they needed her to babysit. And I remember when she first told me about it. She has that. That's what I did. We need to have a comment. Could we be able to start out? We got baby at the top. It's called the McCurray. It seems clear once I got talking to my own Jones, that this is for Carl. Might have a few thoughts about this. And we gave her a call. She agreed to go into a studio in chat. She says if anything, her brother was understand. just as strict a mother was when she was too far She had a friend She called and said baby and they would follow and then I called and she came in and said where do you think it was? It was really really hard she didn't believe anything else And you're pretty good, , care good students go of us I,  for a long time and I thought that I was terrible. My mother started calling me a whore before I had in, and I'd do what the word was. I couldn't look it up because of the smell. It was the spell I couldn't find it. And so it occurred to me that if I had a family, a non-existing family, I could call my coach, he was going with me. I otk scared I started working out to teach skills because wherever you. She babysit and mother had to have the phone number. She could check up her. So the man in the family was an FBI agent who can't have top secret project. Who he could not give his phone number to anyone at all. He also couldn't let anyone, but my sister, the babysitter, know just where they live, but we found some strange cases. to do so. So so so how far did this go? Now complicated to destroy the theories get. It got very complicated. They had two kids. Michael was free and Laura was two. FNV-8 separate between my sister and myself, but it was a reverse. Sometimes they, the little boy in particular would try to test this, I'd let him get away with it, but my sister would. And they had all kinds of toys, but not too many times. They liked their parents very much, loved their parents. They were easy, they weren't spoiled in any way. They sound  very special here. Oh yeah, they were great. They were  no kids, they were very matriy. I think in many ways they had to live a sister wish that we took. I had them rent a cottage at the lake for the summer. So the Macrearies had it had a summer house. That is. And did they require your services at the summer house? Or do they know that the kids would enjoy it so much. more free there and it was weird because both of them I always liked to put it locked. So my mother would accept this quote written in the novel that they wanted to vote. Oh, I was wonderful. We had certificate somewhere. I mean it was, it was glorious. What I was you do? Well, it's just the sometimes it's the new someone at that. Sometimes it's just the very new one. While lying down on the way up... the outside as well. For their parents, they have a card. Sometimes we just need them to be used. Which is the most amongst amongst the humans. I appreciate everything we talked about. So you're thinking about your voice. I think it's completely different. So you can still taste it. I still remember what I said. But after feeding them, it was just so funny. We really got all of this from our mother. This notion of head to see people. Our mother had from the time we were young kids. Younger than time. Mother had three people that she went to see. None of them existed and we always knew they didn't exist. Really? Yeah. Who were they? One was a lawyer and she wouldn't say what she was doing here. but she dropped it off his hands. And what we were supposed to believe was that that was making arrangements to put us in the orphanage. Second person she saw was a psychiatrist. She pronounced psychologists. Interesting. And she went there because he would tell her that we were driving her crazy. And the third person was a doctor. and told her she was going to die. And she, we have no idea where in fact she went, but she was never gone long enough to see anyone at all. So another, she would literally, this wasn't just something she would say to you. Well, I've been to psychiatrist and he tells me that you've tried to, that you've got to start me crazy. She would actually leave the house and go to her appointment. Yeah, she said she, she, she, she goes to the door and where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, because it was so unusual for her to go out except to work. She's... would you  to know? Okay, isn't your doctor? We got older, shouldn't she? Maybe? And so that was her, was her game? The impression spec, what, where do you think she was going? I have no idea. I think she walked around the block and come meet her. So, so someone your mother must have wanted to meet them, right? No. She was shy, isn't the word for, but she didn't  knowing people at all. She didn't know the people that stores, she didn't want to know them. So she was really a deliberately isolated. But the Mac'reies were far in a way, a favorite topic. conversation. I mother would ask questions about them and then Carol would give her far more information to GF for her. Say more what you remember of what she had done. Well, she one was that Mrs. McCury was very intelligent, lovely, very kind, and she was my sister's sister's mother. And she was my saddest year, the older woman who my woman loved with me with any luck at all, seduce me. So, wait, so would you talk about it with your mom too? Yeah, my sister started that. I was a little uncomfortable about it. My sister said, I think he's got a crush. And I would, would almost wash on the country because I do it. And then you might not be asking questions for anything. Well, what color hair does she? No, she didn't ask questions,  that. She never asked questions  that. So what would she have? She'd say, well, I hope you, I hope you act right over there. What do they think of you? And then the question she did this day, oh, what do they think of your mother? And if, dare I would say, if the right answer, which is they think you're wonderful? That's basically correct. She was a way of having a conversation. And it's kind of in depth. That's right. She liked to hear about fancy people. She imagined somehow that we would all rub off. Sure. Huh. Did they be a good influence on her? They be a good influence and there might even be some money and they'd be a good influence on her. Also, because she wouldn't get money from babysitting, she said that Mr. McCurray was taking all the babysitting money, putting it into stock from bonds. Wait, wait, wait. How did this happen? Back up. Yeah, Carol, Carol, Nutsch was going there, so she anticipated. The Carol said before, it could even come up. Carol says, Mr. McCurray isn't going to pay me. He's going to put all my babysitting money into stock from bonds. My mother didn't know anything about stock from bonds. Would we? My mother knew that that's what Rich people did. And it was over on the other side of the way, because the rich side of town. My mother didn't know anything about that neighborhood. She was the oldest seven children who have very, very poor. My mother had one friend who was middle class, who she met when my father was to the lie. And she did. to change in someone's mother and so did the people that my mother. Clean before. And the end of the show is the last weekend. And that was the end of the real change in the material. What happened at the end? Maybe we could do our best for our show. from our real self. And this continuous work, having fun with friends. Yeah, all right. And those times when there's no courage to go to, we'd see about on the beach. And we were going home. And we headed up the back square. We said we're going to back up the back. We headed up the back stairs with a six-four. And we could tell the show, which means we cornered that our mother was upset to do. We're going. reading my words. Turned. There she was. She ready to do. Ep. Her ears. She said, well, how are you to be? we've been much in the church. I'm with you. Oh yeah, I have to have you. Well, you're a couple of damn liars. I just got off the phone with Mrs. McLeary. She hasn't seen you in weeks. My other uncle didn't bring this. He's not all my gosh, just talked to me. And then, as quickly as he really was, he was a close to me. So, we've got one where it's easy to decide, but they've tried just the fact of the theories. And I go, but as I wish, we were deciding to speak in my language. After that, we really stopped talking about the truth. Did you often claim that she'd run into the McCreary? I used to talk to her that she had seen me, she did a so-offly, she believed. There was an amazing, she never questioned you. What, why do you think she didn't question? I think she wanted it to be true, probably is much a side view. It is interesting, when you invented them, when you invented them, it is if you invented them in terms that would be a show . Yeah, I'm probably did, I don't think that. Oh, no, I did, I'm sure it could be me that I wanted it to be a lady. Please, is that because it would make her more likely to let you out? But was there a part of it where you also were the kind of kid where you always needed to be reassuring her? I wanted to come to you, I mean, it isn't something I could just leave out to you. But she was never right to me, that was... Huh? Is your mom still alive? Yeah. So how old is she now? 94. How old are you? I'm not going to be 70 and another 32. So had you ever, , some clean things? No, not. You, you want me to make my mother look  a virus? No, no, no, no, no. Haha, well in the sense you already have, it's just a question of whether she's going to know it. I'm sorry. Alright. Yeah, no. It never goes to my mind to do. Are you saying it's never crossed your mind? It's other. Because she wouldn't be able to laugh at that in the season. Not in any way. She might simply say that we were lying now. There were Macrears. Hmm. You'd doeniz. This is making sad that you can't have a kind of relationship with the man where now that everyone's in the belt, you can't come and scream. No, Mr. and I think because of going away to school, when I was so young, let me back up when I was nine, I came home Saturday afternoon with my sister. I'm sorry. you aren't here because father's figure was a physical proof which you're visiting and he found a very nice word for the time and and and I said but I'm not an orce she said no I know I told father's figure that he says really you are because I have to work all the time there's no one to take care of and I said but we take care of ourselves Father said that, but he said not reading. You go there, be a good place for you, go there. I wish close to who is in my 30s before I understood why I, why I want to wait to school. That's not going to be a good test. Good of gone, got kicked out right away. I do that. One of the things that our mother did was, from the time we were very young, I can't remember before I know before I went to school, at least the shadows. Your father, everybody told me that put the two ears. I did. So, when I did , King came home, he tw deste you found an orphanage for you, What I really did was say you've been afraid this my wife沒事 damn it I will explain I was scared, I was Story of my mother andMAN I was scared I was wa my word, my child Oh yeah E-H oh hey. And that's just, I went home. And I was, who was a, was a, was laid up over poverty dark. Well, I'm so proud of the time I was walking down the street. I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked at lights were, thank you. You're at warm and fair. People in this community, that's an ecology house. There's a window. And I have a house too, I go to school, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. I walked in the door and I started to hug my mother, my mother put her hand and hold me back and said, Oh, let me ask you a question. You're up there with that friend, you're a cool whole. You really think about your mother. I hear a big cry in her eyes, though, you're just , I can't. I can't. You never have to do anything about anybody in the channel. And I really have a bad moment on. There's never an Ashman mother for anything. They've looked to her for anything. How would we then? I would spend. You never have to do anything about anybody in the channel. You never have to do anything about anybody in the channel. It's two years have actually ended up telling about the truth. I was able to do that, and that I didn't even want to do that. And not not releasing me, then going to get anything from it and no, I haven't. But I, I never, I haven't been able to respond to just take around my life, can you? How often do you see me? Do I see them? I am now seeing more twice a week, and I'm calling the night. Which is... So it's something to do with me because she doesn't know that I call her. Yes. Yes. What do you think you've gotten by being with me? ... One time when I was 35 and mashed up and going in a separate way, and told her how I felt back then, and she sat in. chair and kitchen and she was crying and I'd never even seen her crying. And when I finally stopped talking she said, I'm taking the very best I could and I thought all my childhood. Her best best best best of all they had, her best best of all empty, that she couldn't do in them. I decided, and it helps me a lot. I held a great end that I just loved to work. and her mother and mother's mother was wonderful. And my great grandmother who I didn't know but who adored my mother and mother stuffed in that evening. After I am going to do this for the people that loved her. Now, we all are the people we didn't know this in the coming year. And it feels best feels fine to me. what you're describing is you and your sister going off and pretending to babysit for these imaginary kids but in fact you guys have babysitting back. It was for your mom. And the time when you were kids. Did you when he was kids did you ever see it that way? Oh, we're taking care of him. She thinks she's taking care of us Oh, yeah, oh It was it there was your kind of She was a play When I was about to have She gave me a first base close because I was gonna be a do you do often you  me You tell people who gave it a glove? You tell them how much it cost? All right, I did. But I said, yeah. Did you tell them how long I had to work to buy that? Yeah, she said, you did. Let's set the record straight. Here we go. You're on the radio. How long did you mother have to work to buy you the baseball card? She had to work the week. That's a one. I thought about it since then. As I have forgiven my kids of present, who is worshiped weeks, wages? No, I have. Mr. John, what would it happen if you hadn't been in the careers? Go to the farm and get the treatment and and water clean. I've been in McSeries, absolutely inevitable. I never thought of a word out in McSeries. Wow. They had to be there. I still think they would be in another scene. They would be 56, 57 years old. I've wondered where they live on a dude. No way, you're a picture. I appreciate them doing very well. and kind of dull now. Really? Yeah. I don't think you're there as being terribly interesting. There are more conservatives than they're parents. But nice to put with people. Well, well, wait, wait. You think they're living? I'm afraid I think they're living in the proper. They are. That's too powerful for me. I'm sorry. I may run into them in this drawer. Myman and Caralbo said there was no way the mother would ever hear the story on Lydia. And in fact, she never did. The story was through broadcast in 2001, she died at the age of 95 in 2002. After she died, Caralbo told Mary in the secret that she had promised her mother she would never tell them. It turns out her mom didn't actually... that baseball club for my own. They're Uncle Butler and really derived the house that was kept. Myrans mom accepted it. He gave it to him.
