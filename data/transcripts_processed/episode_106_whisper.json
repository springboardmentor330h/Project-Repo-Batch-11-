  "text": "in the B.E.E.S. Chicago Public Radio International, it's American life from the glass. And for this week's program, for Father's Day, everybody in our staff set around and talked about what it is that one really wants to hear on Father's Day on your Father's Day. And Nancy, one of the issues you've been show said, would you really want to hear his parents and kids actually having honest momentary. Potten up with him. And so we tried. We asked this 18 year old named China Will. Here we go. their father, they'll be willing to have a conversation on tape and we teach them got to ask the other all the questions they'd never asked before. And it's interesting what happens when you do that. One of the first things I wanted to start with that was  when you and mom got together. For example I know that I think anyway you guys met in a bar and then  two weeks later you were married. Yeah, it was very short romance. what made you guys get married? it's so quickly. Yeah it was kind of a whirlwind playing  I know in my  from my side I was I was looking for somebody I needed some more in my life and I guess  she basically was in the same situation so we both just were looking for somebody and ended up a phenomena Yeah. I'll do this conversation. Chana goes back and forth between being her father's daughter, his child, and being his peer. And what's so amazing to listen to is that that is the end of the long process parent. Process takes decades. The biggest project most of us ever embarked on. This is how  it all worked out okay. When you've been talking to your kid as an equal. Well what was the  the family reaction? I know Nana couldn't have been entirely pleased. I don't know, . I really don't know. , I never really asked anybody. Of course,  I was in Marine Corps and I really really care what anybody thought about any. Well, yeah, you were , how you were held  25 at the time, right? 25, yeah. That's 25. I had always told myself, , that I was going to live hard and party till I got to be 25 and then I was going to get married. He's , you stuck with it. Sure enough, that's the way it ended up. Well, today on our program, what happens when fathers and kids sit down and talk? It's actually talk. And what happens when they don't? It's kind of amazing little show today. We have four acts, deck one, hand or his box, in which China and her dad, as we said, ask each other all the unassed questions they've stored up of the years. So, we got four items, and we got a wrong stop at the years. Back to MacDaddy's in the building in which 18-year-old San Antonio Brooks lives in the Chicago Public Housing Projects, first of the fathers around her 25 years old, and they became fathers as teenagers. He talks to some of his friends about whether they are better fathers than their own fathers were. Back 3, Bond, Dammit, Bond, in which a new dad, writer Dan Savage, laments how long it is taking him to truly bond with his baby boy. Ecuador, age of enchantment, ready to warn S. Westler and his 11-year-old daughter, Sarah Telatou's story, a parental love, betrayal, fiction, deception, and more love that happened to do with them. Stay with us. And do us rocks. So, I already explained the promise for China's tape conversation with you If you click words about them before we start, China grew up in Waco, but unlike most of the people who she knows, they're China's death texts, went to college, and flew to California, and she just finished her freshman year in Temple. For that, we're to the phone company, selling big switching systems, that's  that. Here in her mom, I've been married and forced and remarried to each other, three times. One of my original questions when first asked to interview you basically was the first thing I just thought. hop into my head that I've never asked every kid wants to know is where was I can see? Where were you can see? If you even remember? Yeah, I was I remember. If I remember correct, I believe it was  that. that. Yeah. It was , , order to the morning, whatever. And I have a little worried pick up truck. You remember that. Good luck! , black it or something, it has to be ended up in a bit. That's a wrong question to ask. Well. As far as me growing up and things  that, , just, I don't know, , going which way I want to go now. How has that been for you to watch me, , kind of not be  everybody else where I grew up? Well, trickle, I'm glad, , and  I thought there's some of it, that is scared me. I mean, just the fact that you're in Philadelphia still scares me of, because I worry about you and I worry about , I'm worried about , collect something happening to you and I'll let kind of stuff. I'll go out, I enjoy watching , I mean it's There's nothing in this world, it's ever pleased me more than you. You're great, , you just can't tell you. I was good in my pot. Well, kind of back to the history thing. , of course, you guys got divorced last May, I guess. I don't even really remember. And then you go married and what? December? Yeah, I think. So, , that's that's got to seem a little strange to every well to yourself too. I'm sure, yeah, but it definitely seems strange to everyone around you. I can assure that. Well, it is definitely is it even to me, ? I don't know how I asked to look at it. , I followed by it over and over. Also, I know it's not my mother.ух . ah ah Can't live with her to take live with that. , I don't I don't I don't know I'm just not sure  what what probably is or what to even myself I can't figure it out Yeah, , it's this point. I guess where it will happen to me If it does it's not gonna be Well, do you think that the last time was your fault? Yeah, I guess in a way it was cause  I got trouble use my drinking tank and  I don't know that the horse was actually my fault because I told her she just slowed down and it looked big picture that it's not that bad she was determined to make her point and she so she did what she did she found her horse, we did the horse and then I guess she did realize it wasn't that bad so it let me put it in front of you I'm , on my end of the earth, it's just kind of confused. I don't know. I think I was not happy but more relieved at the fact that you guys were supporting up. Just because of all the problems that I've seen over the years. And then I just kind of, I don't know. I was disappointed. Maybe just with the situation, general kind of with you. Yeah, I'm very warm. But , I got to be happy too.

When it came time for him to ask his questions first during their year, it was this little technical problem in taking and maybe you noticed the buzzing off the internet. Anyway, his voice was a me reported on phone line to the studio, John sitting in the balcony. And he basically just had one question for John. , that's what that's, great concern is, is your level. Here's a situation  with sex and health. That situation is, ah, I don't know how put coming here well, yes, , is it problem or, are you just hammering? No, it's not a problem. Of course, I'm sure you can, just kind of. How much concern is your main site? Yeah, that's fine. I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do that. Back to, back Daddy's. The same Tonya Brooks is 18 years in public house projects. What do you mean 20 years ago? It's a lot of young farts you do. So they all really sell very farts. They  other teams. They're not. They're young farts. I work, we're having an issue. I know a lot of farts got together. They have a lot of beer. They smoke weed so they all got it around in one room Just sitting at chillies and talking about Things that they did nature  that was one on around the day What what they're gonna be doing all later in the future stuff that This is a part of our program that that's with not gotten quite a close-up luncheon Two thirds of African American chicken raised in single parent families usually by the mother's grandmas San Antonio did story clip and the year ago and my father's day was coming up this year. Thought of said he liked to interview some of the young fathers in his building. Guy's age just a little older. Guy's notes just here. He only talked to them about their relationships with their kids. And their relationship with their own fathers. Some guys, hearing this, try to avoid them. Some people do more than avoid they. Little dots. And why do you think that is? I can't say, sure it's , lot of them just then want really the end of you. I'm not fucking gonna see you. Oh, that's not bad. I ain't gotta get your name. It's not a big name. It's not a big name. It's a big name. It's  that. It's  that. It's  that. What did you think of the first round out that you had to use? First I wanted to go crazy. Then at first, the after that, when I seen no coming into the world of changes. I enjoy it. I enjoy it. Do you think? how people want to hear me and the kids, they want to party all the time. If you kids, party stops. One woman who do have, can go towards the kids. Kids deserve everything, also give. Love, everything. How we see our kids, every week, on three values is... Renew. it's  some of them they start the key they take it it's been hard to get them, it's  they kind of keep they play the father role in them they get money tomorrow up it depends, because most of them they not work they are not so focused they are most damcm too much money I'm so scared of myself. I'm also not being good now. Yeah, you should probably tell it. But it's not good. You're so mean. And all of us, all of us, we're not going to be down there. They just make bad making up. Eat. They're dead. I'm not a person. See. I talked to the side guys and what it was the first thing that they said. I was gonna say they have feelings for their father, but it was too deep because they felt that their father was not around so they really had a long to progress and even a long personality. Was your father when you came up? I would, i was more father hope than its  that. God bless you today So I had to get, how did you feel about it? Actually, I'm not true. I'm a devil in the sky, so it's , I have to see it. In person, see him in person for me to react to it, but at the same time, my fill is not a problem. Everybody out who are with, it's  they father's even left at the early age when they passed away. Somebody. Basically they father's dropping and having eight boxes  that. The thing is going to ask is, I mean, the father's dropping and having a father's. But now they're doing it. And this is cycle day. Everybody in our building need, they pay, I see it, they pay. and all, you're breaking some breaks. Just stay in the beer. It's , they'll not take those steps. How do you feel about your father? I can't explain, my father left, and he hasn't been back since. Whether you think your kid is gonna think of you, ¿Time are you lost? I can't see me in my kids smile all the time every time my kids see Would you say you played a positive role in your child's life? Yes Are there any qualities for the figures in your life? Left? No What did you think when you finds hard you were going to have a big? Man Dude wow But same time Buddha I'll blow this. I feel it been that moment, you're born. And you're going to go chicken. How often would you say that you see your kid? When I get a chair,  I would say that. When I get a chair, but at the same time, I know you were up to me. How often did you buy your son? I'm not a man  you. That's the same. That's the  I think the same course. Hey, bound, then listen. I'm not going to get a chance. That's what I do with it. The last thing I do is I do this idea. And I can say my body may be doing this. Because my body may be in this. And now come. For the last thing I do, I do appreciate you doing. The M.J.M. do too. How do you feel that's far? What do you think your kids are going to think of you? The idea is that he's here. He's going to be more in the middle of the day. It's interesting because most of the guys are talking about it. Even the most of them only would see that kids once we... They all felt  they were doing decent jobs in better jobs in their farms. What do you think? I think compared to Harry Potter Street Film, I feel that I feel that they go on this day and day and day and day and day and day. Even the way it just gives you shapes, half-heartened scorn. That what's supposed to be the same thing. So, to them it does in my mind. It's hard to respond. Right? My mind is always, it might probably kind of say me to a doctor that really not really So, I think it's really good to be a doctor that really doesn't know what to do. I think it's really good to be a doctor that really doesn't know what to do. is last time I said to me, I said three years ago, then before that it didn't be this too. So here partying right, maybe two, three years. What kind of difference would it make you something? Probably we made that depth. I know I probably won't go that way, I'll go on the net. It's a good thing, it's my holiday and I say it to you. What do you think is that one good? Well, I sent an authentic message. They are in your surveillance. The answer that allowed me to ask you not to trust me. I don't want to work with you  that. So, only the days can say about that, the book is about also the subscribe. I do what I do, as well as what anybody else. But I basically have to leave my cell because it's all about that actually. All right. He really came in and he will because , things still look but He disappointed with him, left me. And some ways you probably know why he left for this. You want to get to understand that his mouth right in there. And that's some day my father didn't have some money. And he knew I know why he left for him. He can sign who I'm explained why he came to my mind now. and not in order. So, it's still how I've said and been in well-made, I'm also in your same. I've liked that now. I feel that he really wanted to be in my life. Who were there? This coming down to grab ways, who would actually, was I graduated, what would I do? In chocolate. So, I'm not letting that work with God. You graduate. It's a field of power. It's ... Yeah, not  that would be. That field that if I make rock call, me, I say , I don't make a field of power. That's what I'm talking about. , you  you want to eat that. You need to eat that. You need to eat that. Somebody. There's one to eat that. He's got his forgettire here. You guys see, I had to see myself if he was dead. A father and one who was able to take care of their child. I'm not there yet. So I don't recognize myself in thought. Since I interviewed in that story, San Antonio Brooks graduated from high school in Richard H. Don, his father wasn't here. Daddy's home! Daddy's home! He's staying! That's chill. Now another case study of the dad is waiting for a closer to his care. Then Saviour just had a number of stories for a program to raise the syndicated sex advice column Saviour. He and his boyfriend Terry spend months and months trying to adapt. They finally did adapt the baby boy, just recently. We teenage mom named Jessica. And now Dan is waiting to feel  the dad that he wants to be. My first help, I made a 10 minutes after he was born. I was surprised that I didn't feel an instantaneous rush. The baby was doing his part, it was tiny, skewed, size-robin. But I couldn't hold up my own deal, the dad had. When I looked at him now instant, this is the son of a bull. But this was wrong with me. I was having to build myself to feel something I assumed would happen on itself  magic. I had to bug. Two days my boyfriend cherry and I would be taking this baby home. We were gonna be dads. This moment will come in between the years. We've been to seminars, Redstacks, books, written stacks, and progressive larger chunks at social workers' tripping in and out of our house that opened their bank accounts, police records and stalls for inspection for the adoption agency. We've been talking about this moment, the moment we would be coming to ads for a long time. For so long back. that had come to see more just so much talk on big abstraction. Maybe I was just a little numb when Baby was fine and it's me. Later that night, the four of us me, Terry, Jessica and the Baby, were hanging out just because we were in. I had the honor of changing the first poopy diaper, filled with what looked  her she's ripped. And pretty soon I was starting to feel something. Not quite a dad feeling, but something more than Baby's. But the feelings were tenuous and in focus on them for free. of squalching. Terry on the other hand since there is nothing terrible about this field. So you can write it in the start. So why did you first feel a bond? When we went up to the burning streets in the hospital, we were hours and we were going up and we were watching you get on the smoke, we were going to get on the smoke, we were isations, we reported things when we talked about this cancer died. because this is our... this is it, this is the one. , it's so pretty, it's so beautiful. It's just a little baby boy. It had been... but not what I just... I'm here for a moment. I'm here for a moment. You're here for a moment. Of course he's some. Oh yeah. You're so about to tear you into the baby. He's made up a burping song, so involved, but it not only has two choruses, but a bridge and a key change. But when you write out down down the armarsic to the knee, we'll be so when you write out down down the hand you go. Oh, back, knee. You'll avoid the little boy this boy, you just. Why did I look  you've seen little boy? Little boy, little boy, little boy, little boy. Did you write that yourself? I did, that's original. With most by-law to come to the bond is instantaneous. Maybe both of you are sure by-law to come here to help the bond is not to bring the bond. So there must be something don't go through it. But doing an adoption, we had some options. And when and how to bond, when to decide who officially fathers. So, I'm grabbing to the hospital that day, we knew we could walk away from this many at any point for any reason for these unnecessary numbers. Club feet, club pallet, and hair would have to be pleased. We didn't talk about it, but this was rattling around some corner of our brains. It's taboo in some adoption circles to acknowledge these things. We're supposed to tow the line and save the adopting baby, it's just  having one of our own. We're feeling so big. Momentally personally, it eyes no different than getting her own biological. are, but it is to the fundamental. Perhaps I should stop here to acknowledge something something that you can say to me. Talk. For some of you, I am your worst nightmare. I'm a sexual sex writer and some of the right way to support toy boyfriends and talk to a vulnerable, vulnerable, baby boy. If you're aware, we intend to put it in for your diapers and your... all in there is pretty teaching to dance to Lyre's CA and slowly drop into our preferred advice. Or maybe you think worse. When we were still doing our paperwork straight friends would ask for a second button during that, I would say yes, Terry's got the syllabus. And this I know is the fear. Here at the Slip 2 states to outlaw you can get a little less means about the children and made it very impossible in most other states in the ministering. Here if I wanted to have such a children straight down. They're easier, less expensive, less expensive, more expensive, more expensive to reach. But you can join the priesthood or go to little later. Well, let's stop taking these cheap shots and let's go to the main home home. I am a dad now, and I'm going to listen to this, eventually. What's funny about the whole evil disco dancing gay baby right now, then I'm here. Is that the truth of one game I wanted to do as is actually so much more disturbing. When I fantasized about the dad or the picture myself, I'm very sad to reach the door. Even now, though. I don't feel  I'm going to have to cut the heart out of any of them so much as I can encourage you to think of her kid. Now in my dad fantasies, I saw myself going to work, he might be my mom's a terrier and kid , might help with homework, take the kids to ball games and dolls and camping. My dad fantasies are straight, straight out of the 50s, with terrier staying at home taking care of the kid, just  50s mom. I do see that. And I don't know. I love it. So, one of the most important things, is so much fun to stay on with. Play with, watch a smile all day. Now that he's being too cute and exhausted, funny sound is just great. People ask to hear how it's different to have the baby. The answer is now  to be a family. That's our family. Go out, don't ask to hear his days at home and accept our prayers. We're taping every episode of the talent of this. You don't have sex anymore. And just chill in your home. So Terry Magins would be  when the kid is five, he sounds an awful lot  Jen Clover, making cookies and going to PTA meetings and volunteering for a shop around going to the zoo, being  the kindergarten volunteer helping kids cut and paced and keep things out of their mouths. Terry doesn't seem to be the mom, this is being a dad, but his dad works. Well, my family, you my dad. I think we had to cut the 80. Now, maybe pies the summer. He built houses. He rewipped garages. But he also helped him home or... And I feel  I'm your... Same on my bottom. I feel  I'm sort of falling into some real fun. Terry's following the footsteps of his father. I'm falling footsteps of mine. I completely connected the kid on a round as much. living before your wakes up in the morning, getting on the trees are obviously the night. Doing all the mom things Terry does  a father already. I'm doing all the dad things and I don't feel  a father yet. But I think it's coming. When rude people ask adopted couples who the real parents are, we're supposed to say that the real parents, when people they're in music night, people get come to a need somebody. And most importantly, the real parents, the real dad, is the person the kid calls dad. The kid turned three months old just for father's day. He isn't calling me any better. But he will. Soon he will understand that he has parents and he doubts. He'll come to me and call me dad. And that's what I think I'll find me if he will. I know. Right again, Savage and Seattle. Coming up, the father, the daughter, the lie that lasted half a year, or in child human beings. And our child can self parenting problems when parents cannot figure them out on their own. That's only minute for public radio international and on-coding. This is American life, I'm a glass, each week in a program course which is the variety of writers and forms to tackle that. Today's program for Father's Day, we bring you stories about Father's who do not get a course to their kids and by Father's who do. as with a simple topic. Currents, West Laugh is an author and journalist, a writer with a New Yorker magazine. And this story is about an odd sort of breach of trust between Father and child. Pretty first done with that meaning. And what happened next? He and his 11-year-old daughter Sarah went to a radio studio in New York City to tell us this story. It begins simply in a, which he was little. And he would read to her. , he would get into very active conversations with the characters in the books. Well. we were reading. So for example, we were reading little house and I'm prairie. There would be these moments where she would interrupt my reading and say, I want to talk to India. I mean, have to go look at permission to Indian and she said, Indian, I look Indian in a few pages, you're going to meet more. You've got to be understand, I know he, she's taking your lab, but it's not her fault. She's just to get them. Now let me talk to Laura. Go back when we talked to Laura. And in these things, I would take on the role of Indian. I'd say, who's that talk? And we have these incredibly lab. conversations. Do you remember that there? Yes. Anyway, this sort of thing would go on all the time and in a later point we began reading the Bar Wars series in the series of wonderful books for Mary and Noble. No art in the garden. By Mary and Noble, that's right. Well, should Sarah describe what she's looking about, maybe? Sure Sarah explain what the bar is. Well, the bar was about these little people who are, I think,  four inches tall. and they live under the floor board in the house and what they do is they take things from people, little things that they can use around their house. So what kind of things do they take? Well, they take pocket watches and stamps with them, she's on the wall. And part of the point of the bar was, she's on the loud, are they less talking to people? Well, they take things  that. really hurt them because the book is happened before. So anyway, we're a reading this book. And one day, I came home and Sarah was in front of the exciting locations in the launch. And he hopefully will be in the hours here in our own house. And I remember he is such that humans, I remember he was just sitting and went to a pretty place when he decided to perform a walk in the basement. I was , what's wrong? She said, I was telling you how to stay. I was just wanting to stay anyway. I was , I'm not wrong. And she's , I'm a big tap of strength. And high-frobes, chief-frobes, I'll teach her. And I knew I was talking to her, she should be. I was just wanting to do that. I'm , 30 cents. Wait, wait, I'm just , she ran away. That was right there. I'm just going to be a nurse for a lesson. And Sarah, let me just ask you, what do you remember? What? I remember having seen what you see. It's so strange to say this because it's so feel  I'm trying the bar Wars, but I still believe in them. And if I ever actually got to me when I've never told anyone. And I do remember having seen something. And it wasn't going for three seconds. It was  for me ten seconds. And then it ran away. You need to know when you think about it. You can picture. Yeah. It wasn't, I didn't imagine it was, it was definitely there. And it was a little girl. Yeah, I think. Okay. And then, over the next few days, Sarah began leaving things for a, for a sparrow. And the first thing we were in the morning, she went and raised downstairs to see what her, and she went, done. Do you remember what kind of things you left? I left, ,  sometimes I leave a toothpick or piece of glue. What are these two things for it? I'm just  to dig with that ELF. Have an all purpose tool. Yeah, yeah Walkingston Anyway, so she would leave these things there and she would be so disappointed at this appointment version of desolation That that they worked Long conversations It's a more asarb, she's so sad. And this one on my figure is what I am, but it's a pretty small group. Me. Yeah. I don't know why I did it. Because it's, yeah, the cascade of possible groups. But one night I picked up the start of the minute. I didn't even know what to say. He came bounding up the stairs. Daddy won't believe it. There are bars. As far as just  I said, they took the stuff, they took the stuff. And he was transported with the light and I figured that would be the end of it. And then one. What would happen? What happened next? I started writing to them. I started writing letters. Okay, let's wanted to let me ask you to pull out one of those letters and I will see what you write first. Okay. Now you were six. Seven. Seven. Dear borrowers, I have seen you, but I want to meet you. If I do, I will not tell anyone without your permission. agreed or not and then this is far away. Well then what happens is that that note, I would be a little posted, lay by the whole for several days and for several morning Sarah would be deeply devastated and not been answered. So I went through several days, not quite knowing what to do because she wasn't even more more sad about this person. And so then I figured well. I'm sorry, Marl. I got one last minute. I'm sorry. You're back. Did you have that there as well? Yeah, it's almost the same piece of paper. Okay, so it's so easy. Dear Sarah, gosh, this is strange. Who are you? How do  about borrowers? I thought no human beings ever knew about this. My dad says it's too dangerous for borrowers to meet a human being. But, and he even says, I mustn't write you. But maybe at least I can write. I hope so. I will keep it a secret from my dad. Signed Annabelle. PS, I am 11. How about you? And so you got this. Do you remember getting the son? Who? Sure, that morning what you said, what he did for the stairs. What did she said? Oh, she was just saying, they are. I told you, I told you, and she answered, and she wants me to write back. That was just, over the boot. And she wrote back the video. So, so, so, man, did you conceive of your borrowers being the son? into the bars in the book. Well, it was unclear. It was possibility. And it was a precarious study that he found out more. So there were a large part of the course hypothesis. It's a series between GD and Lawton and the book. And that's about guys. Yeah. I would ask , what was your grandmother's name? And it turned out that her grandmother was R.E. And she just made her book. And then there book. Yeah. And she says that she calls her that P  as an up P pod. And then there's in the book. and then she goes to mom, because in the book, the mother is homily. How long did the goddess get that in for you? How many goddess were you? Think there were, over 17, that in first counting, that the cat got up to me. And there came to be a crisis, in the midst of all this, which was that we were going to be moving about half a mile for course, to the mile. And she got it. to a darker, darker mood and was really, again almost desolate and one day she's gonna be in the middle of the house. There were words, what's gonna happen then they'll start to that. I've been feeding them for weeks, , what do you gonna do? And so what we ended up doing was my dad said, well, we can take and move with us. And then what I did is I made a map of how to get to our house. She did this very elaborate map. That's Sarah said, but they're not gonna be. do this all in one day. And so what she did is she found a... Well, there's this restaurant called Villanova equals E. And there's this kind of  radiator thing on the outside. I don't know exactly what it is. But there's a hole there, big enough for a bar where to get through. And so what I did is I put some  cloth in there to make it  comfortable. And why told them to be good rest there? Because they could probably make the first half of the trip trying the first day and then it was really close to fit Avenue, which is our busiest street now so that when they had to cross with Avenue to get the other part of Palom they could do it in the middle of the night. Why would that be? Because the cars would be going backwards. Right. It was going to take their life in an hour. Not an hour  the streets were going to be. So suddenly Sarah the whole potty to moving went for being up here disaster. And every time we move, say I would run downstairs to see what they had in fact brought some other stuff on them because they had to do it in several different ways. And each time, they had lots of things. Granddad, it was very easy to know what they had because it had all been in my pockets. They just picked it up for a little bit more than anyone's correspondence. I had a whole shoe box full of stuff in there and we had some kind of transport, little three things ever. Each time we move, say I would run into a problem. and then during this time, will you frighten about where this is going to leave that at some point you would get found out? Well, it was getting strange. And actually, it's going to be very crappy. And I would do things , I kept on figuring that Sarah was going to grow out of this and that, or that Sarah would associate it with, would make the association that it was kind of  what we used to do when I would read about the email or a lower, I could think you would just kind of. Enjoy that, but she was getting more and more intimate and more involved. The more involved, the more I can see how the best it's ever was. It really was the main thing going on in her life, her name is, and as she began to win trends about it and so forth, stories that get more and more elaborate to you, straight bits of details that were in the things. I didn't quite know where it was going to go. I would do things. I would send borrowers, obligations. Do it's in the modifications. I would send them. I just happened to something disappear for a while. They'd be gone for a while. I would hope that by the time it was over, so I would have forgotten. But on the day, , if I'd said that you got me three weeks a week later on that day, there would be a note for them. For Sarah, I sent them into the woods. There was a little park nearby and for them to be huge, natural park. Oops. stream and I was on the wall and hoping that that Sarah would get over it and and Sarah did you suspect at that point? No, no, I was really funny, Sarah, is that you would say things , sometimes , hey, it's really weird. Annabelle uses the same kind of pen as you do. Then you would say, yeah, I guess you must have stolen one of your pens. And one day, I heard talking. that's over the leg and she said, Panna Belly's a pant-radi is just  my dad's only really tired. She was saying things  this again. And yet, not putting together. I really hadn't, , the second I started that I suspected it, it was , just I was almost sure that everything happened. I just went up and asked for a sample. Why is it that you started to suspect? Do you remember what happened that made you suspect? I think it was sort of the fact not his handwriting actually. It was that I would tell my- I was in the basement, I stuck my finger into his hole, I felt something sort of silky or something. It was why I did some , oh, piece of cloth, I was stuck there, but I fell and I told my dad, I just looked away from my finger, I told my dad about it, and then in the next letter I hear an aballi and be saying, I think that was that you who touched me when I was wearing my silk dress. So I just think , , I told my dad things up. that sometimes an exaggerated little bit  because when I was young guys exaggerated sometimes I mean things a little bit more exciting than they might have been and then  I read the letter and it had that exaggerated part and it and so I took that didn't really happen I was just  sort of adding that to my story and so that's that made me yeah and I asked my dad and what happened there I was we had moved into the house we've been through the most in the world and I out of the basement. And then we'll box around. And Sarah came down there and helped. And how old? Two now? Two out eight. And the industry. And as this one is fair, we have the panchy. So that you can begin. And she went for a little problem. And she looked very firm. And she was asking me, let's get there. the one or not. Big breath, and I said, yes, it is me. And she broke. And she was sobbing. She started sobbing. It was easily the most wrenchy thing that happened in my ear. I had totally wanted to just hold it. It was asked. And I was crying. And she was crying. No, we were broke at him. I'll see you in the chat. and all of each other and it was really a trap that we were down the whole that when we were a big trouble . And suddenly this kind of com, who was Sarah's face, was kind of  sun rising in the morning and her foreheads not being furrowed and smooth. And she just looked at me and she said, Daddy, don't you realize you would everything because there are followers and you were taking the letters, were they were able to get them? And it was a... way of she had sold everything because, , I don't think that was going to be able to tell her to send her to the hospital and they don't struggle about what they were. Great father. And, , and it was amazing. She found the way of getting us out of this session. I was , I remember saying that, , you should have left it there. Maybe they would have really written that. You should have done it because maybe they would have actually written that. Yeah. I can find the answer. I said earlier, I still believe. I know that Nissan Roy Babies, some kids might be, might listen to the eyes of the people. And my child Megan, my friend, my child Megan that it had been my dad. She stopped leaving me. And she was just , never I talk about it, but I know she's not in the medical system of me. Because she's a year older than me. And that time she stopped to sort of something really superior to me, even though we're longer. best friends and obviously I'll say stop being a baby. It's not true. It's just not trying to say by seeing lemon. She said, no, you haven't. You just imagine it's not from you. You can just stop imagine it and stop time you back because it's not true. How do you feel about it? I don't know. sometimes when I read them, I still sort of think that, . I wonder why this happened to her. I wonder why that happened to her. I wonder why she lodged. I know that it was my dad writing to me. I still sometimes sort of send up. They're being an Annabelle somewhere up there. When we pulled out the box last night, the letters were written in the letters. Well actually, I look at them a lot. You looked at it a lot. Yeah. I'm a police executive. Well, I just think it was sort of now I can back and serve as a do. That because I remember when I was happening, I'd have to grab those hands. I had asked him, well, can we still sort of write you each other? In other way, we never really actually wrote each other after that, but I just third thought after a while that he was a nice thing. And that even though maybe there wasn't a bar or a run into me, there was maybe having my dad make up this whole family with me just as special or maybe almost as special. I'm sorry. actually be great fighting to if I want. Sarah, can I ask you, what do you think of the lesson of this story is that is a parent's peer you tell the story you're in your dead history on the radio and if another parent gets into this kind of situation? What's your advice from that? Should they go wrong? Should they write writers and should they pop stuff? I don't know because  it was really fun for me to have this kind of experience but when I found out that it's my dad writing. I was really saying. And so I just, I don't know. I think that I would, if I were a parent and I had that kind of thing, I would not. You would know. I would, I would keep in mind my child to keep on writing to the Mars and trying to get them to write that. But I wouldn't think. And one of the key points is so sad, that the morning, where you are sad from the names, meaning, vision, vision, vision, vision, and so. Can you imagine everything in up? No. It's. Five. Okay. multiprotate. And let's taste something that really keeps in mind the day. So let's start. Hold on. Oh I should probably go too. I don't think it's fair to me, someone else. When it's very short and so what's the lesson to story? If you've had this to do again, you would get into the situation again or if you could go back with the benefit of hindsight. What would you do? Would you have left the letters? I mean, I'd  to say that, I had a little over again. I wouldn't do it this way, but I'm not sure. Because it was a... it started so bad. And in the end, by the way, what I'd have to say is probably the most poignant, closest, mazing moment I've had, is the moment I'll remember of. But to get phased in my life is that is the whole beyond each other, in the basement, both crime, but, but, Sarah not writing where he is, and Sarah Savius, and that kind of spent our wish. really kind of wonderful way. So, , I don't... In my land that way for everything. Yeah, it might not end that way for everybody that's true. It was, it's a, I continued to, to, to hustle about this. I was all, as my answer. It's interesting to me that the way that you, the lesson of the story is that Sarah saved the two of you that is a parent, you got yourself into a moment where you literally didn't know what to do. And then, and then, and then, she found... I've never really said the thing that made everything okay. I absolutely do that. Is it effective relationship? You're not fast. You're using your screws? No, no, no, I used to trust you. Sir, do you view this as one of the moments when your process is too? Well, I'm very close to my dad. So I don't know. It's , yeah, I guess so, but it's not  much closer than I am. Usually because I'm very close to my dad all the time. But yeah, this one. the time's high as close as she does. Yeah. You're mine, mine, mine, hard as mine, you're okay. So, do you still think they exist? Have you tried to spot them? Then they tried to wait for them to spot them again? Well, I have seen. Well, I'm not sure because I've seen them in shadow. The only time I'm absolutely positive I saw one was downstairs and basically my own house. But I have seen them since sometimes I go and I'll sit at the basement steps. Come on, let's sit downstairs and Staps. and look around and sometimes  I'll be making say cake and I'll weave a little bit of dough wrapped in some paper by the staircase at the basement in the basement for them to take. And do they take? Well, I don't know because if I don't find it, but then again, that can go to bed. I'm also a dad. It's a style of women. I'm a... I'm a... That's as calm. I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... Orange Westwood is the author of Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders and Climates of Exile. Sarah Westwood just graduated from elementary school this week. When we spoke, she said that she would be listening to our radio program this weekend in the car. I don't want us to listen to it at the house because if there are still bars, and then pop it up above us out of space? in our house. I don't want them to hear that and  think that they can't trust me because it's right now I'm  telling their whole story. I'm  sort of I feel  I'm sort of train and I'm mean I'll and I just  wanted to make sure that they knew that if I actually didn't meet one I wouldn't tell anyone. I would never tell a single person in the world. Sorry, I don't want save.
