  "text": "As we had in the final days, this presidential race, considered this story. My footerman is running for student government in the Marinette High School, New York, 1995. The Marinette campaign that changed electoral politics in the school was for one. Here's the way to this, I'm done. My opponent was getting paid for that. Who was a year older than I was going to be a senior in the university. So he had to figure, he was going to win that class. Then it was a... to the crash report and it's side to the election. And it was not looking good for Matt. Those key swing voters, up to the police freshman. In the end of the final days, for the election, just as we are now, this presidential race, a Matt turned to his best friend's brother, Benning, for advice. Benning came up with this campaign slogan that turned the race around. Here's Benning. Vote for Matt. He is good. He'll give you wood. Essentially. that would walk around the Marinac Public High School with arm follows various types of wood, twigs and sticks and lumber and such. And anybody who wanted wood would get free simple wood. Then then I had another idea, it could make a TV commercial. That's right, TV commercial. Nobody had ever done a political TV ad in high school days. There's one thing. The school head TVs in every room, the school's morning announcements were done on these television monitors, they could play either ad during the morning announcements. The next day I met in the room, went to the video room, signed up the cameras and tried high and we went out back to the parking lot and he had brought some vlogs for me to hold. The whole thing took about 15 minutes to fill. I'm standing there with words. the shot opens on there. I say, the high on that footmen, I'm on the card front, secretary executive board. Maybe Matt said, vote for me. I am good. I'll give you wood. Bennett has his arm around me. He got a microphone in his hand. He closed it back to his mouth. He looks very serious  into the camera. He says, what do you mean? You're gonna give it away for free. This is that's right. And it's absolutely for free. You want bird? You got birds. You want oh, guy got. Oh, he went fine, he went twigs, oak, beach, maple, magnolia, windy. He went sticks, he went two by fours, high got it for you. And then it looks very seriously into the camera and hold up a log and says, bankwood. Let me just ask you to describe, just choose one word and describe. Okay, this, this ad errors. It's first time during the morning and out. Despite being one word, the reaction from this, it would have to be the nanosystem. ,  pigeons to the bread bear, who was just swarmed upon by students from every great, wanting a piece of wood. People are coming up for seconds, for thirds. I mean, it was just  hell Mary touched down. And before I know it, I'm looking down in the back, I'm very quickly running out of wood. And I'm thinking, I guess. I gotta get out of here to get to my wood. Hey, I got to the point where he was giving away so much wood where there was such demand to give away the wood that he had to stop giving it the way it's seniors because they didn't have the right to vote in school-wide elections. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Do you have to modify the ad with a little at the end? Yes, use that a pot. I believe the ad played one time. One time was enough though. Come on, let's see, Matt easily swept into office. And the next year, there's a Matt's commercial, the age of televised politics hit my Marinette Kai, full force, nearly all the candidates had TV ads. And interestingly, nearly all of them would dreadfully dull. They went on TV and they'd drowned on about the qualifications and what they wanted to do for the school. Does it think, what it was that made Matt happy? So effective. Please benefit. It appealed directly to what was most important to the students and what was most important was not how the traditionally defined offices and duties of elected officials. People did not care about the calm about the track teams and the forum. What they cared about was being represented in this sense of absurdity. The sense of absurdity in the app. The sense of absurdity that not was willing to. Express in the ads does represent Ku-theid. Which brings us to the current election? Well, it's true that we want candidates with whom we agree more or less, only some of the so-called issues. I think they also want. Or I want them. And I don't think I'm alone in this. Some of them spontaneity, human joy, some I'll give you wood moment. I'll give you wood moment. to trust this guy. Canon is known this too. At this point in the evolution of focus group, hold driven politics. They are absolutely learned that what we want is some moment that is not focus group. So they are going to determine the going to jail, the other jokes, they try to charm all to try to get outside the soundbites. Outside the soundbites. Today on our program, driven by the same desperate impulse. We also try to escape the world of the soundbite. We have three different stories, that parts of the selection that do not fit into the scripted, pre-plan soundbites that we'll be hearing from you at it in the next few days. Back one, bull's rush in, we're soundbites through to tread. Jack hit reports on a multimillionaire who helped swing this winter's Michigan primary by Trashing mainstream polls and very unfocused with way. And what he has planned for these next few days for the general election. Back to you. Take a Juniper 2 pencil, in which we look at the issue behind the issue behind the sound bite. That's confusing, I'll just stay with. Act 3. Nepotism. The Genders Guide. And it defense. Adam Davidson discovers that he is the same blue blood ancestors as George W. Bush. And when he was where his family went wrong. And where the Bush is went right. And why it takes 220 years to get to the point where you get to say the sound bite. international is this American life I'm out of glass and remember for the next hour I will fight for you just a with it at one bull's rush in so in these days when we earn for more of our politicians to shoot from the hip a little more than they do jack it found somebody who fit though form a dubinitorial candidate In Michigan, Jack does the story. Less February, I was sitting in the office at the multi-millionaire Michigan trial lawyer, Jeffrey Figer. You'll remember he was Jack at Borking's lawyer. He was also the lawyer who once walked into court, carrying a big picture of the prosecutor to his opponent with the clown that was been gone. I was trying to figure out how Figer wins hundreds of millions of dollars while using tactics most of the refined outrageous, even insane. But I could barely get in a question because it was just a few days away from the mission. in Republican primary, and Figer was in sense George W Bushman when. Remember how it was last winter? Bush had just barely defeated John McCain, the South Carolina primary, and Michigan's governor, John Inglare, had declared his state to be Bush's quote, Firewall against the king. On that cold afternoon, Figer's phone rang every two minutes. It was a couple of his pals who were encouraging Figer to make some negative ads attacking Bush in order to humiliate Governor Inglare. 25 years later, Michigan voters began hearing. Fires at. Hi, Jeff. Hi. They're back. Listen to this. George W. Bush's record of results. Speak for itself. Of Governor, he demanded higher standards for school. What trial lawyers over lawsuit abuse and beat them? What? When they say they ended lawsuit abuse, they mean we got screwed. The ad is a whole minute of In Your Face Victory Hall, right up to the sign-off. Here's the catch. It worked. The least George Bush thought that he lost Michigan. He was blaming Finder by name for interfering in his problem. Months later, with Michigan heading towards another incredibly transnational country, Finder and his buddies decided to do it all in. Just one week before I let . I have to claim to know that with fire files, the guys who help write these ads, Eric Humphrey, a radio producer, and Leon Wies the lawyer. I wanted to know where they had packed, special interest group, what were they? The best description of us would be Jala. You can see it, but you just can't get your hands. It's  we're a loose-knit group of people who have some shit. the wrong political beliefs, we do not represent the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the libertarian party or any other organization. I'd say that we're probably coffee outside of the cup. Just don't know what to do. And they are cognizant. In the stage of focus creates and marketing demographics, and niches  suburban males, 18 to 24 years old. Their idea of the target audience seems totally antique. Other people... , still has an open mind and maybe has a sense of humor. The only dude radio ads in part because I'm so effective in the state of obsessed with cards driving And also because it's cheaper than one might think to get into one When these ads they might spend $20,000 Now it's  a grain of sand on the beach absolutely  10 or 15 or maybe 20,000 dollars is a close deal a lot of 40, 50 million dollars. They spent on television, especially in the last two months. So it's nothing. So mosquito on elephant's high and court. What do you think about the ads at the two candidates? But what are the ads ? They are totally ridiculous. It's sick and boring. And boring. I want to literally throw my television set out of the one You got it. negative ads against George Bush from Alkourd. You've got George Bush with negative ads against Alkourd and then you've got Algord George Bush both sitting in class from the talking little black chick. I mean come on, knock it off. Tell us some. By late afternoon we had a journey to the offices and the J.R. Radio. We'll be trying to work further on this. scripts when there was a commotion. Fired or swept into the studio  a conquering hero. Dressed in an expensive blue pinstriped suit and muted red tag. He looked Bush or Gord here in the first debate, except for his hair. Shaggy 70s retro. He was obviously still high from the euphoria one must experience the mess in the jury for $150 million and knowing that he did. Once Fired took a seat in front of the studio face, arrogant men. He developed a nicer way more selvatices. typical moment, Eric and Pem up with a new line for fire. Well let's do that, write that out. Okay, you can write that out right now, I  that. I think you got to have a lot more than just that. That's about 10 seconds. Okay, go! Talk about it! Okay, I gave you one pin, I gave you me other. Here's your pin, but no, you can have one pin. Oh, the creative process. So fire took his pin back. Just a minute. I thought by coming to WJR, I would. witness was the contemporary making of a way the Horton had the most famous attack had in contemporary politics, not officially sanctioned by either party, and so, able to put out and distorted racist message about Michael the Caucus in 1988. But all day long, I was amazed with this unusual integrity on display. Firing his panels wanted to ridicule Bush viciously, but there was sort of pricy about it, surprising he concerned everything in the happy true. When Leon wanted a lion saying, Texas leads the country in water. air extract it, ardent the Texas was only 49. Again, here's Finer. General, political ads that are out there are just absolutely horrible. They're an insult to my intelligence because they're their wives. Generally, wives, I mean, just out now complete wives. I ask, frankly, or, or, or, I, impeccably research. and empirically correct. There was a kind of internal logic even to the boundaries of their own bad taste. A monochlorist, yeah? No. A bunch of bad Jewish jokes about how Liban moved to save the country money by buying wholesale. Next. At one point, Jeffrey started scribbling madly in the yellow lingo pad, and then told everyone to hush. He said he'd had a divine inspiration. He wanted to try out a new act on set. This is Jesus Christ and I'm a little pissed. I said thou shall not kill But what don't you understand about that? For example George W Bush. He's got a death toll higher than slow-bid on Moses And you guys want to make him the most powerful man in the world are you nuts? Won't her bush and piss off the Lord? Oh Oh It out What was amazing about the whole experience with so much fun and all that? It's hard to capture the madness and pleasure in the field room. Obviously, it's been an inspiration, but it's a pleasure you will never see in our formal public politics. I don't think anyone has fun. That's everything that we do. I believe it's me and I think it's the perfect thing. It's only interesting for me to find out, but now for some reason, the idea of fun and the spoken is I don't know. except for the rejecting or looked down upon. I don't know why, but I'll tell you that that's the way I feel about everything. I mean, life is so short. I just looked around and then I was, , 18 years old and 41, right? I'm hooked. So fast. If you don't have fun, what else? What do you excuse for being? Isn't this the kind of unscripted spirit most of the settings in the synchronized string politicians? While it's easy to do this from the signmags, the question is, can you have this much fun if you can, and then go on. In fact, fire, freedom, and the team is lost. You lost a march part because it's a point for mind the builders. The fire regularly sets short. the time here for a digital system's quote, just some goofball to get them to the cross. If you ask for it, then that will turn angry. you would stay at the conference, but I've read the book or it's pretty bad. He says believing in Jesus is just a silly, selfish thing. People have a reason. And that's the problem that's shoot from the politics. And yet maybe the whole experience made him a little monster. Over the course of two hours he calls every sober past is the last moment. They'll bring that girl up. what I see what she just go ask. They'll tell it. They'll get into everyone. places. Hi, this is Jesus Christ and all. Hi, this is Jesus Christ. Look, and I'm a little pit every time. It cracks everybody up and every time. The on and error try to talk about it. Oh, you're crazy. We're connected. We're connected. We're connected. We're connected. Right now you got to juice the blacks and the Catholics all over your ass. And this is the one time I watched my postfire on a big issue in that shit. After two and a half hours they've been 2-6 second ads, completely sound effects, music, but  the Beatles, bygones says, because one of the ads. Hi, this is Jeff Fierre. George W. Bush has never accomplished anything on his own, and his entire life, let's take a look. You don't have the qualifications for a game, my boy. My dad is George Bush. You're welcome to Yale, my boy. You don't have the qualifications for Harvard Business School. My dad is George. You're a musician, highly produced in one end. Get the whole process with soap improvisation. and find himself as completely unreflected. To the point that wanna kept asking him to talk about the strategy, he got a little mad at me. We don't get the idea. We just do it. And who in your mind, who's vote do you think you're swaying? I don't know. I'm telling you. If I have to think this reacts on somebody who hears, I don't know. You're asking me to analyze this in terms of, and then be absolutely serious and intellectually, , delve into it. to the user. The thing, and I'm not going to do that. I mean, it would ruin the spontaneity and let me just tell you this. Okay. That's why it's sick. The political asset fire makes the one-three voters allegedly find the most horrifying. Unaccountable attacks, not affiliated with any candidate, same to worst possible things. And I wondered if the populous part of fire, if I think that's something wrong, I'm not going to do anything in your disguise. here and take potshots in the voletition box. But I was wrong. Figer thinks there should be more than that everyone should get in on the game. When he told me this, I realized that what Figer's up to is in part of the new wave of negative advertised, but actually is connected to something very old-fashioned in American politics. The pure publicly of calling the other side names. This is the way it always was. In 1884, the fact that I drove a clue had a chance. a child out of woodlock and republicans marching down the street delighted to sing mama, where's my paw? And Democrats would shout back, gone to the White House. Ah, ha ha ha ha. , I mean, it does seem  he'll have an lot of fun. Yeah. And there. We do anything we do. It's got to be so hot. Is that fun? We wouldn't do it. Do you think they haven't fun over at the Gore in the night? Yeah. Let's talk about prescription work. And so, so secure. And 1500 up. $30,000 in $20,000. We as a broad, we just said, but we did, it's fun, that's what it is. How many people have you heard? Just today, say, I can't wait until this damn election is over. Everybody hates it. There's no joy in our politics, no pleasure, no one's laughing, except it seems. They're , who's having a ball? And now some... all of his ads with his trademark filming glass. Pete for by the committee against Dom, Dommer and Domest. Jack hit, lives in Connecticut. Coming up, how many grandparents and great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents? Do you have to have with the middle names Herbert and Walker? You did become president yourself? You ain't seen nothing yet. In a minute, public radio, international, when applications here and I'll keep new programs for seniors To gpv.n application It's a American live America. Today in our program, outside the sound bites, in which we try to avoid side step or look beneath the presidential candidates talking points in these final days before the election. We have our reddit act two of our show. Take our June number two pencil. One thing that is striking about this presidential race is that the two big issues, the two big candidates, the big most. Part 2 things that most of us do not really understand at all. Prescription is what? and school accountability. And so the candidates throw the little catch words back and forth, and how are we supposed to evaluate that? It is as equals to choose between them based on their chances on the permots last year. So I produce your Alex Lombard, look behind what they have to say about education, kind of the reality is the same way different from the little speeches. There are differences, fairly big ones, between the Bush and Gore education points. The Bush and Gore education points. Go ahead once more money for early childhood education and teacher training. Bush wants to vouchers for families and family schools, but at the heart of both their education, it's the idea that kids should be testing and tested often to be sure they're being taught. Look, we agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance, every school, every school district have every state tested. The children, I've also proposed. going to say if you receive federal money, measure third grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade eighth grade and show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and answer track and if so there will be a bonus plan instead of continuing to subsidize failure. Testing is the cornerstone reform. how I know? In the first presidential debate, the only argument about tests was who had more of them and whose were top five kids and teachers. Well, first of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes as step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. North Carolina is one of a handful of states in the country that's already about the denducation plan, similar to what both candidates are talking about. It's called the ABC program, and it's based on the same simple promise both candidates proposed. We hold schools accountable for teaching our kids. The schools that do well. we reward once they don't read the moon changes and the way we tell, standardized test. I talked to teachers from five schools across the state and what they said is the reality isn't as simple as the campaign rhetoric needs it seem and that North Carolina's accountability program has consequences but it's good and bad that interestingly neither can it seems to mention. So how many tests have you taken this year? The Kira cup to see test in the quarter test. the reading into quality test and there was a practice computer compass test. And what's the day today? I told the AT. Kids in North Carolina take a lot of tests. In some schools as many as 30 days out of the year are given over to tests. The most important tests of all the tests everyone talks about, the tests from which all of the tests originate. are called the E-O-Gs or end of grade tests. Every kit in third grade to eighth grade takes. Nearly all the teachers I talked to said that lots of is improved since North Carolina started its educational reforms in 1996. There's a new curriculum which the teachers , teacher salaries have increased, and what resources are going to early childhood programs. But when talking about the E-O-Gs, a lot of the teachers use words  frenzy, mania, or in some cases monster. That's because a lot is writing on E-O-Gs. School scores are published in the book. local papers and on the internet, they show up in real estate listings. Principles of chronically low performed schools can be fired. Teachers at schools that score a well on the test, for sure market improvement, receive bonuses that goes high as $1,500 for teacher. But teachers have enough questions about the testing that some of them have turned down the money when it's offered. And in North Carolina's fifth year of reform, the issues have heated up enough that many educators get edgy talking about it publicly. One state official hung up on me in the local conversation. At a school in houseborough, the principal. involving. When let me talk to any of his teachers who had him being present. And then there's three supplies. My name is Teresa Glenn. I teach eighth grade language arts in social studies and I've been teaching for three and a half years. And where do you teach? I teach in Montgomery County North Carolina, which is in the South Central part of New South. All right. And are you in school right now? No, I'm not in school. And why is that? I'm serving a suspension for discussing the North Carolina and an integrated test. I made 28 that this year, Theresa Glenn posted an impassioned email message from North Carolina Educational Lists Server, posted by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. In nine paragraphs, Jial and perveres concerns with the Eog's, and the last one, she summarized. And the last paragraph I talked about some of the things I saw, last year with my students. And I said, I apologize, anyone is offended by any of you, but I'm personally offended by the Eog tests. I've seen students, good solid, A.D. students crying because... of the tests. I've seen students who work hard but lack of native intelligence to pass of two-hour multiple choice tests were tamed. I've seen teachers do nothing for the last six to ten weeks of school but work on EOG preparation. I've seen teachers publicly humiliated because they had lower test scores in the year before. I've seen children made fun of, called names, and put down based on their EOG scores. I've seen teachers look down and their nose is because a child is a three-three on the EOG test and not a three-four. The entire spectacle is discussed. The part of the email that got her in trouble was the part where she discussed the specific content of two questions on last year's reading E.H.G. She pointed out that the two questions required students to know information that wasn't in the reading passage that was supposedly being tested on. Not long after that email, her principal called her into his office and told her the state was considering revoking her teachings. , to be perfectly honest with you, I was absolutely floored. And, , my principal called me. And I really  my principal because he's a very upstanding man. He called me into his office and said, , did you say something on an email form about the test this year? And I said, of course, , there was not, it didn't occur to me that, , maybe I'm just naive, but it didn't occur to me that you can get in trouble for, , discussing the shortcomings of these tests, particularly when they, , almost life and death at least academically for students. So it was very stressed. They eventually told Teresa that she violated and agreed that she'd signed as part of the testing program, that forbade her from paraphrasing any of the questions on the testing public. Teresa says the only reason she was allowed to keep her job and got away with just a suspension. She says that one of the local school board members present that are hearing odor of favor. She says the big problem with the tests, as how much time and resources have been diverted. Some teachers in her school, she says, spend 50 to 75 percent of their classroom time on test prep. A huge chunk of the school's book budget has gone to buying four different tests that book's for each student. She says no wonder it in the state of Sussa Touchy. , the amount of money that's been poured to this is nits. If somebody says, this is not working and you just wasted, , $500 million on this program that's actually hurting kids, you have to think that there's going to be some kind of serious ramification for that person. And you think that's happening? That $500 million is important to the program that's hurting kids. But I just got something yesterday in the mail about, , from there. the public instructions sort of bragging that somewhere over a hundred million dollars have been handed out in bonuses this year alone to teachers who were at these new schools that have made the biggest gains. What do you make about? Well, I'm a personal level at the press to me because I've been asking still for the same two novel sets for the last two years. I haven't gotten them. Are you serious? Yes. What are you trying to get? I just want I want in your scheme by Orson Scott Card who actually lives here. North Carolina. I just want 30 copies of it. And then I want there's another novel that I'd with John Krakow or Inteseneer, a book about the crime to Mount Everest . The kids would love that. They would be totally into the position scoring enough that they would interested it too. , that's that's all I want in my beautiful life as an April teacher. And I don't foresee myself getting. And I know we talk about high standards, but in my mind, , just teaching students answer multiple choice questions is about the lowest standard I can possibly imagine. That's not the same thing as having the skills to live a productive life in a democratic society. I think we're robbing the students of what education should be, which is a love of knowledge and the ability to pursue. GAY! more knowledge as you want to and we're saying that the purpose of education is to pass these tests. When I asked the North Carolina State Board of Education for a school where their plan was working, they sent me to Allen Brook Elementary in Charlotte. It's in a poor neighborhood and has a history of poor performance in the tests. Four years ago the State Assistance Team came to Allen Brook to help him prove. Kind of think I'll go and let you see that in everywhere. scaling school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principle with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina if it's a fact. Actually they don't shut the school down, but there was a team of specialists and 70% of the staff either quit but was transferred and the principal was removed. Kathy Hammond was his replacement and under her leadership the school was made remarkable gains in test scores and she readily credit the accountability group. I think our staff is doing a phenomenal job of addressing the needs in education. When I taught, and I taught for 16 years in a middle school, I never had an administrator asked me, why are you teaching that? What is it you want your children to know that they didn't know before you started? No one came, as long as the children were in the room, everyone was quiet, parents were happy. I could have been teaching late for all. So, , I  the idea that we have a set of standards that I'll children need to know, and that we're responsible for teaching. Here's what they found when they tried to fix the school. First, the problem wasn't the teachers ability. The state team evaluated all the teachers, and only one was rated below competency. The problem was there simply weren't enough of it, especially for the task of bringing Allenburg student population up to grade level. For whatever sociological reasons kids from porn papers tend to do worsened school and worsened standardized tests. You can bring them up to speed, but you need to. extra teachers to do it. If you have a child that's coming to you that's coming out of an environment where they've not had a bed to sleep in, they've lost their parent for whatever reasons or incarceration or anything else, what do we as a school do about it in order to put support in for that child in that same? You cannot do that without at a staff. You can't do that in a classroom with 25 children and one teaching. What brings us the question, did the state need a test to fix Alan book school? Principal Hammond says what actually improved things was extra money, which he used to hire more reading teachers and a full-time social work and a school psychologist. What about her with you? Why not just supply that? We know enough about how children are successful to fix every school in a new year. Come down to the question, are we willing? Do we have the will to do it? And are we willing to put the... resources in the places that need. I am not a Pazdo County. I think a calendar is great, and I think sometimes we get carried away with the way we measure a calendar because it's more complex than a score on a test. If what comes out of the National Day, is that the only thing that we need to make our school's better is, , as a tough national test. for everybody. It's daresing. It frustrates me that people think it's as simple fizz. That we don't spend more time talking about what does work. And one of the reasons we don't want to talk about what does work is because it takes a different level of commitment, takes a different level of resources, and it takes a different kind of dialogue than a statement , I'm going to fix all of the schools in the near. She has made the unintventually, proving our court that they've received, if it had not been for the ABC program and the Alabama program being embarrassed by being on the front page of Charles Zer, the local community would have never put those additional resources in. This is Bill Kirk, chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Education, and one of the two guys in charge of the ABC program. Alabama has the National Resources if the ABC program had an embarrassed to the school. I don't want about that after that. Bill Kirk says that he agrees with principal honours that it's harder to teach kids before it back comes. You need more resources, more staff. Says he's gotten those things for course schools and he's trying to get even more. But the political reality is it's easier to get money from state legislature if you can show them results. If we had had that, you see we would be getting additional resources for the local government to go properly that far. States are passing a lot of money in the schools and they won't be able to pay for it. но We're not going back off. A lot of teachers complain that politicians and people from the state use the language of business and talking about education. And many people are suspicious of the fact that Kirk has had a both-state board of education in the state chamber of commerce. In other words, the main education law, and the main business law. But it's entirely possible that the same business law category that raises suspicions among teachers is the very thing that makes them sick. Where everything that makes them sick. successful at getting money out of the legislature. He puts the concerns of education, language, the legislature understands. Still, he can be pretty abrasive. He describes teachers who don't  the tests this way. They want business as usual, I think they're lucky to have everybody who likes to use as a Walter, but anybody thinks they're writing and the quietness is going to cause us to get wing-pages when you have social promotion and put in an exit to them and go to Vegas. This is a metadata I receive and this report of student performance on the second retis with the North Carolina Integrate Test. Kathy Rouse's youngest son called was in third grade last year, in Hallsboro, Artisha Elementary School. He got Azenbees, but he didn't pass his E.A.G.s at the end of the year, and then he failed his two elaborate tests, which meant he had to repeat third grade. I told him that I went to school and I would be teaching a told me that he hadn't been. And I said that means that they're home to that. And I thought he just cried hot tears and he asked me, Mama, was wrong with me. And that right there, that was it. , it's not even more than a reading problem. Back to me is we be healing of the old slot and actually psyche. Cathy protest during case before the county board and finally had caught and promoted. He isn't forthgrade this year. Between 1991 and 1997, 66 studies were done on home and kids back. 65 showed it to be either intellectual or damaging the long line. And a lot of times it's just not necessary. Even in schools that start aggressive remediation in kindergarten, it's common not to see higher test scores till 7th or 8th grade. Third grade is just too early. how things are working. It's got to be roused, this is just common sense. No task, or anyone, especially anyone considers it as an educator, can indicate what's you going to be when you're h is up? We do not begin to categorize our children at eight years old and let this stand live and have lived and we need eight years of it is something wrong. I don't know where I have to go, but I wouldn't have it done I don't have to see it. himself as less as just as 8 years old. That's criminal. I mean, there are studies and all that on that, you can help yourself in it yourself, but such in place into learn. Even among teachers you think the tasks have made education better and North Carolina, Matthew, Jamarian, Davis. This is a big word. Not everyone will pass the first. In the worst schools, over half the kids fail, even in the very best, it's 10% what happens to be told. We are just assuming a higher level of competency than is possible for all children. Let's see if it's okay. The danger that is that we're asking them to be something that they just can't do. Put a child in the desk for the chair and saying, Will it test you over and over to you for passes? Do you get right? Isn't just not always gonna happen. That's why I'm saying to expect to get average? and the state will get on is going to reach 11-3-4. So they can be promoted and said they can graduate is an unrealistic expectation. And having that unrealistic expectation is not fair to the truth. We are taking it out on the heels. When it's not always the kids' fault. And that's sad. That's real. We shouldn't do that, but sure. That's abusive. This gets us to the crux of what covering a bush might fall, a difference in philosophy, the philosophy of teaching. How much should you demand results from students in the weapon versus how much you should nurture them on your own. Phil Kirk in the state legislature think things went too far towards nurture and it is time to go back the other way. A lot of the liberals  to pay for are more worried about themselves than they are about what children did raise their eye. We don't, we don't bow that line. In a school assembly, in the Jefferson Elementary School, Jean-Naisen, I saw this philosophical divide for the Gulf of Trudeas. Jefferson Elementary is set in a Winston-Sailum suburb filled with mature oaks and small and split levels. Inside the school's carpeted classrooms, kids sit around work tables, not a desk, and quietly read a right-and-chernals. There are hangs from the wall. alls, right about the high-deproperate book shows, and Xthu the Hamster cages, and various aquariums. Jefferson Elementary is very well on the E.O.G.s. Today's assembly is because people from the state are here to congratulate them. Last year for the first time, over 90% of Jefferson's students squirt above averaging E.O.G.s. making it what the state calls the school of excellence. That's your state. Dr. Brad Sneed, one of the state administrators, explains what this means. One has to be added to all that powerful leadership, that powerful teaching that powerful leadership. the powerful participation of others. What does it take and really get a school to school of excellence? It takes you death. It takes you decide I'm here to learn and you have done your leaders, you are leaders, you're saying to say to me, we're meeting any more to follow. Keep in mind the group of leaders being addressed here is an auditorium full of schoolchildren with missing teeth and those gym shoes that light up. They're sitting cross-legged on the floor and shy ones. in the future. What I promise is reaching them from all of us, it's probably not the one that speakers intend to. Witness this failed column response attempt from Dr. Martin, the second presenter. Hey, you are Dr. Sneak. You are Dr. Sneak speaking about responsibility. We do in your work. We reset the finally ingredient that we have capable administrators, excellent teachers. I believe you use work powerful teachers. Finally ingredient is, you got it. right? And so it will be takes responsibility for you do your work and learn. Now, where's third grade? Third grade once you've got to stand up because you're going to be taking this this year for the first time. You'll be a part of it. So all of you are going to do one. Hey, where's the final winner? Good. I do as you can see. Then Dr. Moser, Jefferson's principal secretary stage. He's an easy guy to love. His sweet and soft spoken. And a f***. anything a little embarrassed about this assembly. He readily admits the large part of the reason his students score so well in the E.O.G.s, simply they come from well-off families. And when he addresses the students, he doesn't mention responsibility or leadership. It's all nurturing. Well, look, so good. And it's always nice to get to look straight at you every day. Boys and girls,  that we're very proud of you. We're proud to work you through every day. Teachers, I couldn't be more proud with the relationship and the atmosphere as to your classrooms and the lower children. I'm here. Every day, it has a good experience here at school, you do a great job taking care of our close friends, and that's very important. And I think it's time for lunch. What's obvious is that each philosophy comes with its own language, the language of leadership, versus the language of lunch. And each language emphasized its different things. The teachers lounge after they assemble it. I'm swallowing. by teachers who are angry about the testing and how heavily it's being emphasized and how high the stakes are now. If the two competing impulses in American education are accountability in the one hand versus nurturing on the other. It consensus of these teachers at all the teachers I talked to across the state is that obviously you need both and even if the pendulum has one defying direction of nurturing you past, with George Bush and Outgore are both proposing to push it far in either direction. What's needed is balanced in the teachers. But whichever man that's probably not what we're going to see. Let's go, man. What? What? What? What? What? He choose things. I want to be a teacher's best. I want to be a heartless, close to you, because I can't get back. three. So before we end our little election special, let's have a quick word about nepotism. In this country we're supposedly anybody can grow up to be president. We have one candidate who was raised in Washington, D.C., son of U.S. Senator. The other guy, son of a president. And it's confusing to some of us, especially our contributor Adam Davidson, who discovered recently that he and George Bush share six, that are six common ancestors of him lived in 17th century England. Adam is wondering, how did this happen? Here did my side of the dynasty go. wrong and what did his side do so right? Why did he get the presidential nomination handed to him and I have to borrow money from my girlfriend to pay her rent? I think it's probably true George W Bush is not all that right, but he knows something, his whole family knows something, they know power, and they know how to get more and more power every generation. Well, Adam, you and George Bush are both descended from experience, Mitchell, and some sister of experience, Mitchell. was descended to the late Prince's Wales. Presidential genealogist Gary Boyd Roberts. And so you Prince William and George Bush, senior and junior, are all about 9th-10th cousins of each other through this one forbear. So this is a matter of one set of 6-8th cousins becoming social-wechist-right American leaders and the others remaining in small town. are small cities and the ugly term forward is quote quote swamp danking. This is Gary Boyd Roberts favorite ink. He loves linking people. For him there are no distant cousins. He mentioned any mowengling name and how length of right up to queens and kings to the Mayflower to you to me to himself. He's a great genealogist and he told me we could find out exactly where the bush was meant to be right. Where mine went wrong. It all goes back to 1783. And my folks had a better piece of land than George's. That's where things started going so. It seems that the bushes were forced to move out of town that year to get better farmland while my family stayed put. Well, they see these are people staying waffly. I mean, they may go five, six towns away. But they stay in the plumber of area from 1620 until 1886. Right. No, that is 250 years. Staying in the same small town. Staying in the same small. And. Where are you? The world was moving elsewhere, meaning economic development and serious cities and finance and education had long since moved up. And just missed out on opportunities. Maybe that they didn't, that economic deprivation didn't force them to go in. So they might have been just successful enough not to become incredibly successful enough not to feel  they weren't moved. Exactly. So let me recap this for you. The bushes were poor cousins. One. doing that well so they decided to go somewhere else. The move started a tradition. Each successive generation went to wherever the next big thing was. First of Vermont were better fun than to Ohio for steel, while street finance, and eventually Texas for wood. And it only took a little bit of wealth to make everything look  these. See they used the prep schools, they used Yale, they used the whole summer connection to make wives which means a kind. of use of the social register world and they instill senses of duty and sportsmanship and fair play, but they also introduce this and she call it Sensor entitlement, which many people have had late on smuggles in editing, whatever. And they've now been in the four-flops of America politics for about a week. Which generation starting in the 1800s would... You make the family a little richer, a little more blue blood, and then would use their money in friends to create a network of political allies. And only once that network was placed in a run-in-for-office, all the Bush's students. Press cut Bush got richer than his dad on Wall Street, then made friends, then went to the Senate. George Herbert Walker Bush got even richer in Texas, then made even more friends, then became George W. Bush held it in the exact same thing. All the while my family stayed, the each generation and family went that smaller. They're only friends with other farmers. So when things finally got bad enough, they had to leave about a hundred years ago. The only place to go was a new college job and a city. By then our family went from being bushes periops to being nothing to swamp the trash. While our poor bushes cousin stopped having to work some hard. Now what makes the bushes interesting is that they have... all dinastic families, a mythology, and a set of predictions and values that they pass on for one generation to be asked. This is Adam Bello, he's writing a book about nepotism. His father is Saul Bello, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. And in the Bush family, it's considered important to be or to appear to be his self-made men. The therefore of the younger Bush, George Sr., George or the Walker Bush, likes to tell story that. after graduating from Yale, got into his car with his wife, his infant son, junior, and drove off the taxes to get a real business. He doesn't mention that he used to spot the skin actions to start an oil company, and the same thing is true. Of course, son, a junior and a jet bush. Not that Adam Bellow thinks there's anything wrong with that. Nepotism is not good. It's not bad. It's how the world works. Only in America does anyone get upset about this anyway, because ever since Benjamin Franklin filled his poor riches, Almanac, would advise on how to be prosperous. There's been this idea that anyone can make it here. With a black heartburn. Franklin Busy was a man of the middle class. A self-made man, a self-made man, and interestingly, when he became postmaster general of companies in 1730s, he gave all the jobs that he had under his control in all 13 colleges to his relatives. All the postmasters and all the colonies were nephews and cousins. And all of it has been Franklin. And he moved them around and went up and died. He would give the job to another. And this is the great self-made man of America history. Sounds  what you're saying is there's not only do the wealthy know how to use it better and have more rums. material with which to work, but they also are the only part of our society that doesn't have a stigma against it or at least is very happy to overcome that stigma. And so I wonder if it would be good for us to open up America and have a tendency to say here today, everybody use it, use it all you can, and let's make this a major tool and getting everybody best of Jim Famous things. We where I come down, this is it's never going away. Studies of the labor market, it is how people get jobs, indicate that most people get jobs continue to get jobs through their relics. It is just the way things are done. Adam Bello has been studying nepotism for years and he hasn't found any level of society, anywhere in the world doesn't use it. So how do you feel good about yourself when you're sitting there, from that nice office that you didn't hear me around? Well, for one thing, Zanimpello, you can have some humility about how you got the job, and you can work your ass off, and you can work so hard that you earn the privilege that you left into. Take the two George Bushes, Elizabeth Mitchell who wrote W, the Revenge of the Bush Dynasty, told me that they both say they're self-meaning men, and they're both obviously fooling themselves. Their family are notks in. They are using their family letters of truth. his head starts. When George Herbert Walker Bush, the father, the former president, moved to a desk of Texas and worked the lowest jobs at an oil company, painting rigs, handling supplies. The company he worked for was dresser industries. He was owned by his father's best friend in the old room in New Malen. In fact, Senator Prescott Bush, aid the company to Malen to run. George senior worked hard and ultimately started his own business. He actually kind of brilliant. He was a pioneer. offshore drilling. When he became rich, richer than his dad, he earned. Now take his son. When George W. drove to Midland, Texas right after graduating from Yale, he went straight to his father's best friend, his father's former campaign manager, Jimmy Ellison, who set him up in a low-level oil industry job. That went nowhere. Then he ran for Congress, lost, and then started a huge oil company himself. He didn't start at the bottom. He just called his uncle, Jonathan Bush, who quickly raised the money to create our boost up. The primary funder was Philip Uzzellie, James Baker's best friend, and college roommate. A man who said he knew he probably wouldn't make any money, but felt loyal to W's dad. Sure enough, our boosted went belly up. George W went on to get family friends to buy him two other oil companies that also went. He didn't have any money, no successes to be proud of. And that is when his dad's pal built a wit and invited him to be. a co-owner in the CEO of the Texas Frangers. George W had to borrow money to buy a end because he was well. People say he did do a good job with the Rangers. He got taxpayers to give $135 million for a new stadium and he finally made himself and his dad's friends and money. In tracing the Bush Family Tree, I found that every single generation since 1780 has found new ways to make money. and being power. They were visionaries. They figured out what the next big thing would be and then they took risks and reap the rewards. In my family didn't. Bush's family has been working towards this Tuesday's election carefully and steadily for the last 220 years while we swamp Yankees have been watching it on TV. And at some level, it doesn't seem unfair. The only thing that bothers me is that they're sending in joy. which W to take the big prize. He hasn't been a visionary or a risk taker. If he'd followed the family tradition, he'd have gone to Silicon Valley and started a dot com. Instead, he entered the West Texas oil business when it was on its way out and was bailed out repeatedly by family and friends. And he could be our next president. Or we'll get the other guy, the son of the senator from Tennessee. in a Davidson, Liz and Los Angeles.
