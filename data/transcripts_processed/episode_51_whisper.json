Look at how thin this is. I mean, this is a page from a 13th century Parisian Bible. And there are 100,000 of these. It was the required book for the University of Paris. The University of Paris. There were thousands and thousands of students and professors at the University of Paris several centuries. And what's really amazing about it is the writing isn't too common and it looks too small to actually have been written by a king. And then did I go on his new 13th century.

The reason she knows so much about manuscripts she tells me is that she doesn't know anything about anything else. So they're all the written all  all 99.9% many of manuscripts of middle ages are written untarctioned and parchment is animal skin. Animal skin, house, goats, hats. And in the case of the delicate perfect page that you showed me, probably. This would be , , a rant. , if you take a rant a whole rant  this big sort of size of a, a foot of heart and you skin it that makes a bifolium, which is true of these pages. So that's it you again. And then you don't get 600 of those animals. You got it what? So we're thinking 600 grads, 600 grads, 600 grads, squirrels or cats. The idea of cats is kind of recently because they found all these cat bones,  a mound of cat bones. a huge mound,  a burial site of cat bones. Right by,  on near the sand, we're all the, we're all the, we're all the, all the little bookshops are now on the sand. That's exactly where they were in the 15th century. What game these manuscripts were standing? I was really a struck by just how complete our dominion is over the animal world. , but we can slaughter 300 cats. , our squirrels are rats or anything. Just to make this one. little little book. Now on eight century book of book of cows, they say represented a herd of cattle. But I'm Gutenberg live  the first book ever printed. It's called Gutenberg. So Gutenberg each of those was a herd.

What human writing could seem more than? What do we know if anything about attitudes and the religious towards killing off that meaning? I don't know anything really. I mean, I would, my guess would be that, , since their tongues of callophones, that is little descriptions in the back, saying, I'm so pleased to have done this for you, God. This was wonderful. It was worth all the time. So probably they thought that it was great to the animal too. The animal was serving God just  they were by being in a book. Peace with that, of our shared dominion in the animals. There are only a few attitudes possible, though, guilt, indifference of a piety, which wins us today's program.

What do we choose to believe about the sacrifices? The animals make for us. Well, J. Allison came up with this answer. That question. When they came also the Ark, before they would disperse, remember he said, God said to him, every beast of the seal and salivate or shall be Kung Fu'd unto you from the stay heart. A friend of mine, a classical pianist, I know, had a dream that he was sleeping in his own room when something woke him up. Gathering at the foot of his... bed was every animal he had ever eaten. They were just looking at him, breathing quietly. They pushed in closer and closer around his bed as more kept coming. Then when the room was full the ones that came first started to pile out through the bathroom door. And for the rest of the dream, each animal in turn simply paused by my friend's bed, looked at him, and passed on by to make room for the next. I went to the slaughterhouses and I went out to the cattle ranchers and places  that and I talked to the animals because I wanted to know if they were really, if this was a really traumatic thing. It's  I experience what the animal experiences, it's a vicarious experience. I feel their emotions. I think their thoughts, I literally become that animal. They show me what they look at what they see in life and that I see it as a procedure. This slide's up  I'm in here and we're killing here. Lift this gate here then and I'm gonna roll this up down here and put a chain around your leg. We're using this chain and put it right around your leg. I'm  and pick them up. So when I was there and I asked them how they felt when they said they didn't mind giving their life for a purpose. And I watched the ones that were lifted upside down where they tied them up by the back legs and then they slipped throughout the young guy. No more we call her. no more here?

And those animals felt a lot of pain, but it was only  30 seconds. And then because they were upside down, all the organs pushed towards the cutoff of blood splint in the animals when they actually had their throat cut. They were numb. Go on across, lay them down in the cradle, take their legs off, take them up, and embrace their roe cheese, into the bones and釣頭, slowly down the back of the end. There's just two haves. People say, oh, I couldn't see an out of sight. One of those animals wouldn't even live. If it hadn't been for the fact that there were going to be racism. They wouldn't have even been born. And they rolled out the end of petting room and , pet up in state's roast ground beef. And wrap the packed label. And then we... but it's very short. , the animals tell me, , they've had most of the ones that are raised for food. Our raised for their, you may, you're given the best of food, picking the best care. But they told me, no, that they felt this was a purpose in life, they were socially in the end to study, and they accepted the role. Because they were not afraid to die.

She factors a comical note about my arrogance that her girlfriend had been beat. All after me she could be looking at me with her head cut. Needless to say, it's a long day. Then it's five after everyone else is gone, she comes shally by and says she'd love to go out with me. She says, I've always been there for her. She says she likes him now with the little meat on his phones. She says pick her up at eight and bring something for life. I'm sure you can see the wind and shock. I'm overjoyed. I'm nearly shaking my little desk apart. I buy a line of football helmet and baseball gloves and aquarium and set of insightful duties. Basically, I've seen my pitiful savings. Keep cares. It's worth it. We get a chance to divert beautiful face from a crossing cable without fraud at our hooting view. In the end, in the end, in the end. In the end, in the end. In the end. When I ring a bell, someone's free. on me. Inside I find land behind home and a penis in her and this is recipe and grumpy pouring over her graceful ubuk with a high lady. She looks up and says, where's that kid? He's  saying how should I know? Instead I say, he's behind the home and a penis in her. We love the back there, he says. We sitting in the lint ball.

Again, if night 3 ice-step outside for some air, up in the sky a wild cloud that making people continue to parade the sailors on big-synthescent wooden ships. Meanwhile, here's me, and from me. with the joystick firm on the spot. So I throw the game cartoony trash and go back to work. I take the ridding and take the abuse. Someone spit my head out of the office folder and mounted it on a bright body. Since there's what the heck the thought of the visual and congruity of our pairing was worth with 50 bucks. Can you hate me? Please, please ask. No, I say I truly enjoyed our evening together. I had I didn't. She said everyone kept staring me feel better on myself when... I would actually with you. Not in mean. You can't think of anything to say so I'm not. Then I would treat Moistide to my cubicle for some in-voicing fun. I'm not a bad guy. I'm only a good stop hoping. Only I could say to my heart to give up. You're alone forever. You're always opera. There's indicate gates and neighbourhoods, children, carelling and the look of autumn leaves on a wet roof. But no, my heart sometimes idiotic vision bummed. My invoice has got very well. The sun sinks, moon rises, browning hills on a stupid face. The minimum I find office time by volunteering for the Carl Allen Fatt. Carl L is a rich, and poor guy has a rare coup in problem he sprinkles poison in his trash and causing a day.

A lot of me observing laying out the rotten fruit. I show them how they cage their coming down from the herd of fleets. Then go inside and I wait patiently on my tongue. Just after midnight I trip the wire. I pecked the caroliles and encouraged them to squat down and relate to the captured rethrone. Then I recite our key and speak and gradually numb for their advanced thinking. I described the wilderness where the release will take place. The streams and photo valleys, the romp and raccoon stride when it catches its birth Delta, that had developed practically a representations is fails. Mr. Carl also is thanks for letting him sleep at night sand skill. And tell him that's my job. Just in the recomb huge mate, full-sotted of words and tears in the mud ca.

I stand the gas in the driveway's sick and heart. I trapped my share of recombs and helped quad with more burials than I care to remember, but I've never actually killed anything. I feel both tunes in the trunk and drive myself to the emergency room, where I'm given the birth of the series of extremely painful shots. It goes off on a bench post-fleement and dream of a den of pathetic baby raccoons and penis sweaters, the open for food. I'm going to wake up by calling. Tim Master, I'm crazy kicking your raccoon to death in front of pines. Tonight, I gently lift his off, the ass or offer it some rotten fruit. My car, my dough is through a one-car funeral. He tells him I'm truly sorry I didn't handle a situation more effective. He says a raccoon must have had a sad last couple of minutes once it realized that it had given up its life for the privilege of knowing on a shank of pure fat. That hurts. Why I continue to expect decent treatment from someone who has installed a torture chamber in the corporate basement in underneath. Now, there he's got a hide of bed and a whip collection and an executioner's mask with a built-in lock-in.

Talk about some father somewhere who pressed bottom and knew what his daughter was up to. Once I peeked out of the left and saw a blonde of the black eye going wherever it's pointed and picking up his coat whenever he probes his rock. Kind of people get my things I thought, can he change back? And they learn again to love me to the general? How can they look at themselves in the mirror or in Christmas ornaments without overflowing and sub-loving? When I thought maybe a beast but at least I'm not cruel to the point of being safe hearing. Next day Tim was inducted in the rotary and we all went to the launching. The spoke on turning ones life around. The spoke on the better lessons of incarceration.

And after lunch, home is rotary plaque in the Turkish University of Wale and order new to the windmacks the daily of face-to-screen grim consequences. Who's a Carpool's office? Quad and I approached the burial pit with the car-well raccoons. He grabbed the cage and he was shrubbing and swapped in. Quad whispers that I smell. He whispers that if he weighed 400 he'd taken the account to people around him and go on and die. The pale girl and the sorry get out of the car and lost the little little pit. He paces up his account for instance, scribbles and... in the notebook, he takes photos. To sit down on a rear and comes back up with some cool bones in a baggie.

He says we're here by in crisis mode and we'll keep the cool down blue ice in our cubicles and if need be where no sprouts.

He says ammo right. are all well and good, but there's a big difference between a cute corner of your tap and discussing raccoon that drives on carrying and trash and creates significant sanitation problems with its inquisitive needs.

When I get back to the office, everyone's confident in life. The music's off for a change in log-wax and harsh words are floating up in the basement due to heat ups. Before a long Tim comes up to stare at swearing, I hide the content.

This next story is a story I recorded during the summer years ago in Washington, DC. Society has a deal with people in certain unpleasant jobs. It pays and money and they handle disgusting smelling stuff so nobody else has to. Well, meet clients, Hicks. I'll pick up the mountains on the damn man. I think it did. They don't, they can't, whatever. That's my job. Washington DC has three dead animal catchers in the Department of Sanitation. This week I went out in 36. What highway are we on here? Two naniside. South-Fast. You're down low. See, you just picked up that bird. How long did the LZ? I probably did it on a couple days. Know  that. The body has gone suck all in, so you're... The room has stopped me to move. Okay, we're running across the highway now. Okay. I feel  I can't. This is a kid. This is a kid. It's been here for a long. Yeah, he got up, sick? He's got a flat on one side. Yep. The cat's head was still normal, but the body was blackened in this oven. Mr. Hicks lit a pitch for it under the port gang, and carried it back to his truck. We dropped it into a metal trashcan in the back. It was hot. Some are the busy season for dead animal catchers while animals are outside, so more are dead on the road. And then there's the smell to deal with in the hot sun, the animals decompose fast. What sort of person does this kind of work? Pirate's hits 51 with great go-tee. He has kids and grandkids, but no pets. Before taking this job a year and a half ago, he worked in other divisions of the Department of Sanitation, cleaning outlies, working at the city and senator. He says this job is definitely a step-by-step. I'm a home boss  a mama's cell. All you do is give me the work to do I go get it right in the body, ball of the all the time. Driving around when I'm going to be driving around, yeah, driving by myself. And how are you doing? It's not very strange, but mostly Mr. Hicks stops by people's houses, picks up their dead pets or dead animals in the neighborhood. Maybe he doesn't a day. He or she doesn't have to rush. A dispatcher gives him a list of animals and addresses over the radio. OK. peut's you. So 62 of high street, salty, that's your credit, didn't you? Hey buddy, you said gay, can't lay it away. Yeah. At one house we were supposed to find a cat, but after looking in the street in fact we're everywhere, we only found a fish, ten inches long, silver blue, in perfect condition, but dead. Maybe they got confused. Maybe so. We had other stops, a cat under a tree, a dog covered with maggots. Over in 30th place we will call out for a squirrel. Yep There it is, it is right there. It took less than a minute. Yeah, take a perimeter. In a truck, yeah. If you put in a truck, we put it down, and we go to the next step. Quick or just wait. I'll look at our strong personal reaction. It's the good animal. A stranger wearing a white cap in a deep... just walked up to us and started talking. I don't give half my life for that scroll at one time I was a person doing a career in one I set up off at Han River and And what Seagulls flow I'll be bleeding that thing in a crowd. That's our home We just I am must got a right we kill and most come because that we force them off their land I think they had must right on it's manhead or human beings The reports from our contract they were here first. Are you the person who called it into the Department of Education? Yes. They'd be in short period of time. They'd pick up that before they'd pick up. Most human beings said. Back in the truck Mr. Hicks said that in his job, he can't just throw the animals around. People will complain. After respect, people feel into that animals. He more funeral director than garbage now. But yesterday he said, when he picked up a woman's dog, and she was really really correct. , it's a sad thing to see people really quiet. You've just crossed about the atmosphere, really great, but I'm. What was the Santa Maria's dream? You were a great adult, , you see, you're not texting. So what you didn't, what you said? I'd say, well, I'm sorry you're not sure about what you're not seeing. She was crying, so I asked you what you didn't do at home, so I said, I don't know, I'm , I'm , you don't know, so it's about the sound you're doing. That is the moment you chucked, I'm not sure the next time. The next stop for us was the animal shelter. We're ordinary people, bring their animals. We put the sleep as they say. Pister Hits and another animal man, who are in Daniel's. Put on aprons and gloves and carry it. Five big, gray plastic barrels, animals into the truck. Fifty or sixty animals in all. And that garbage bucket head. A couple dogs, couple cats. Two dogs, one dog, one dog, one dog. Awesome. Oh, it's another tough, healthy day. Thank you, John, for here. All the animals who take into wet Mr. Higgs calls the box, a walk in freezer near the city and simulator. There, the animals are lifted into metal oil barrels and lab. This job changed the way that you see animals. To me, now it's a miracle to be given, and it's a little chanker more than anything. I don't believe you. I see animals differently, just from seeing those dogs and one of those how do you see them? Are you seeing them decomposed? Well, they know the destiny point of view. They beat the decomposed. they have data all that, but you're lying, you just didn't really write them. I say the next time I see a dog on the street, I'm gonna think to myself, I'm just gonna remember what those dogs in the back of your church, but they look different. They look different. Yeah. they are not a lot. But  a lot, if you run them in, if you say a lot, they'll all be so well, you can't pronounce what they make you back in the back. My most Merciful managed to fill up the Japanese homes and all sorts of stuff was offered. But I imagine using one of those live homes our social networks, Do you see those pictures of, , I guess it's the angel of death, , big black hood and  kind of a sickle old guy, , holding a sickle ear. You're grim reaper. Listen. Yeah, actually I think about you. Well, it's in value because that's who you are for these guys. That's you. Well, I'm the angel. See, when it got, I'm gonna take them to him. I'm the, I'm the undertaker. You, right? I'm gonna have to take. Hmm hmm. For now, I'm just trying to reach the moment of the lift. Where is the call? All that kind of feeling for something  that? I take more of the street. Give me decent disposal. There you go. A few times a week, a rendering company comes down from Baltimore. Pick up the animals that Mr. Hicks is gathered and left in the box. In Baltimore, these smelly creatures that nobody wants are changed into smelly things that people sell to each other. The ingredients for perfume, fertilizer. stuff that ordinary folks can handle themselves. Whoa, if I can talk to Nana most, just imagine it tapping with a Jimpitch in pansy. And imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a Giga, what a native Giga they were feeding. It's way to talk to the Anna-Moodle, and learning languages may be taken on Anna-Moodle 3.

If I can walk with the Anna Morgita, with the Anna Morgita, squee, as far away as the end. And love they could talk to me. At four redemption. So what do you think it is your mission to keep the animals from dying? Well, a hardest case must have used the six animals in trouble. But we are gribos per person. I just  as a can't stand the suffering of an animal. An animal looks up at you. And to me, I can feel what he's feeling is a human little thing. There's something. going on. I don't just see a furry, I see the eyes and I get right into the feelings of the animal and something affects me and they have to do something about it. I don't have that empathy maybe with people or maybe I don't allow it, , to have that with people because some of people can take care of themselves, you guys can't. These animals can't. So I see that and I have to do something about it, but I won't throw the line, see, I can't go to the pen. I mean, it's with the director, the whole setup. I can't go to the pen. He has to meet me in a coffee shop because if I go to the pound I'm gonna walk through look at every animal take every dog This ready to be killed that day and bring them to the shelter You can't do that But I will , so for me and know the weakness the weaknesses don't communicate don't be there just be removed I can't go over the next tail if I don't have the room Still this is the sting inside of me that pulls me and I go into the next tail and I find things all the time I always find someone And this is my code and this is the way I live. My one message to animals is if you're hungry or if you're here across my path. That's my message. And since the day I said that, I was in Hollywood, I told you I'm walking down the street and cats are jumping out front of me. Ever since then, I mean my friends and nobody has this problem. I go down the street and they pop out of everywhere and they're limping or they're hungry or whatever. And that makes me feel okay that I don't have to worry about did I miss you? Because I said no, he's okay. because he didn't press my cap. And it is the same way, it's the same thing when you have one as very sick, making the same decision. You tell me what am I supposed to do? , I don't want you to suffer, but if you can make it, , and do you want to make it, and all these other things being considered, and still even then it has to be suffering with absolutely no prognosis. I have a dog at home that I got in head to stamper, end it up this dog lost use of his rear lights. The Vets said, put it down. No way. She lost the front lights. Now, carrying it out five times six times a day, and that I'm waiting at twice to flip her over, because I can't move, she had a heating pad on, she couldn't regulate her heat. Everybody set my wife that heard about it, said, it's insane. I stopped, , we just stopped letting people know the Vets said, how that dog do I always put her down. I didn't tell them six weeks I did this back and forth, because she wanted to make it. There's just something about her. One day I was unbouncing her up and down on her feet so she can get muscle tone. Unbouncing her and she's just limp and all of a sudden foot goes out to get her balance. And it was best thing that Bailey put her foot out. Two weeks later she could walk. Now she's running tearing up a vatter year and a half now tearing up everything she's just... She always remembers, , that she was appealing to live. That you just need somebody to give her a good... the chance. I give them everything I can if they want to make it wrong. If they want to live this something about it they fight I fight with them. I have a cat at home. He had leukemia he got cancer he got lock on. So I look closer. He says two of them is building up with fluid and we did a special new surgery we put a tube inside him. And twice a day I used that tube to pull fluid out of him. He's in no pain and he purrs constantly he just purrs and purrs and purrs in the eats and he. And the most most important thing is to make them well and even then it's only for a few months. I mean  he's going to get it eventually. And it's amazing. But we only really pay that kind of attention and that kind of devotion to the binary and that kind of trouble. That could be it my wife has another answer. She says when they're that close to that they become perfect. And that's the attraction. I don't know. They're becoming  they know more. They know something they know. They know what's. going on they know here in beyond and they know how we're doing caught up in the middle of the tube. and they know something. And whatever it is, it changes them. , they become worth more if that's possible. I mean they they be here. I don't know. Just give them, , give them every shot. And let me see what's going on out there. piece of American would think , Translated with a I'm proud to be here. You've got this great job. Up to the maximum. Breathe through.
