That's good, whatever. , , that's six months and not dying. and all just interesting things. But at the same time, the music will be probably that I might die six months that was happening all the time. So, no guarantee that I'm dying.

Thought of doing something else for enjoyment, pleasure, for just right now. But this sense of that we used to care that we just brought forward was extremely discord. I thought it day by day. I thought it day by day. I thought I was doing something wrong. One way is it dealt with this. I was actually able by the last piece to not think about my life.

And so what he decided to do instead is that he did each town that being a person of comfort and being very generous. And I have witnessed this and that his family could easily kick me out on that stage. But I also pushed his name to put him inalted fence to Freak and welcomed him back out there, aware he would have become and he went to a house and he'd say, I'm sorry, I just, , he'd say, he dropped me and I came out that. And it very, they would say, yes, and then invariably they would also, some point, but so I would spend my evenings with Harley-Wood Mary, and I job at that point. I was telling my story, telling how great a time I was having. Because if I wasn't having a great time, I really disappointed. Because I was riding for that. I was for care, so I was doing.

It's worth it. I guess, blink. Okay. End quote. Luke thinks he's sounding  a short story and a creative reading class. Of course, trapping side and rising novel. The accommodations itself are television dramas and situations of itself. Camera comes back from the behind-the-scenes. Sort of on our mini-cran, camera flows, covers over the back and seeks out. The ceiling is the darkest angle of the camera, and it's the extreme. Bill pulls into the closest parking spot in the evening clear.

It's , I learned after my brother's , that's his experience almost near. I've got a ponte. No. And I have it. Is I need a sick brother? ? When I said, I remember exactly what I said. I couldn't, I was ready to let her stand here when he was in the ICU. I didn't want to go in there. I didn't want to go home. And that's all him. He was , laying there and I saw my love, though. And I never saw him. But I had a talking there. And he said, oh, my love. And I didn't know he could smell anything. And when you said this to him in the hospital, he was awake. No, I wrote it. He saw it in red red. And did he say anything? No. And then when he came out of the hospital, I just , back now,  it never happened. No. Well, they can say, on the answer, oh, I love you, brother. They're okay with me. So even nearly died, that kid. Even nearly died hasn't changed anything. Yes.

She has to work as a hostess and Sono Di��요 has paying tribute to eachono, Last time I can't defend my misdiagnose with the disease and nearly died and it got so bad that on the end she couldn't get up there that's occupied everybody's human.

With his four-and-middle fingers side by side sticking out from the rest of his face to demonstrate proximity. You nearly die. Be self-smiling. teasing me. But it looks  you live. Oh. Why? That's wonderful. Life won't miss the opportunity after the other. Was this close? My roommate in the hospital tells me how lucky I am. She says that when she arrived, there was no toilet paper or a paper towel in the bathroom. How am I supposed to wipe myself without no toilet paper she has? Indeed. Great to be alive. Later I requested private room, but her line of thinking gets me asking questions of my own, big questions. Biggest questions come at Neil Tongue, such as, what is it? When eating the nurse comes in with my dinner tray. I situate myself up right in bed so I sit feed myself and lift the cover off the on-challel. They've served me my own pancreas. It's more is they try to pass it off as, I tag in B. I tell the nurse there's been a mistake. I think I may have some pre-alces trained. Now she says, no mistake. So many questions. So many many questions. Oh, the morphine drip provides five or six brilliant answers. But I can't remember them now. I'd rather a way the hour is in a semi-fought of hope that maybe the doctors miss something. Maybe, yeah, that's a ... Lucky after all. Maybe they're wrong about me. Maybe I won't have to return to that world of tenting bar and waiting tables and customers with their selfish tastes. We let this hunger for penny-anti-attention. No more train and bus connections. Flowers and get well-carned with keep coming in all day long. A few days I'll have a moon. And friends will flock in from the trees or wherever it is they've been hiding him . Tell me over and over again how much they love me. They'll tell me not so much in words that in the way they massage my feet, get me eyes clean, bring me gifts. Not another book on the mind body connection. Oh, put it with a stack of others there in the form. Did you find out if to share overhead in more of those little bed jackets for me? Dr. Fargate comes and goes with the scrubbing debate. Think that the status of his depression. Anyway, he's barely in the tune. Later. I'm a fairy we're looking at stage four. It's critical. Oh, so, girl. I thought you were going to talk about my bill. And tells me at this point I should do anything to lift my spirits. That night there was a champagne party in my room for the entire world. I let one of nurses wear my dead cap, the one with me and my sister. I let one of nurses wear my dead cap, the one with me. along the brim. A few of us are busted for struggling back in. Drunk on fools with long after the others have returned to their rooms. I pranked Falco, various former employees, leading messages of hellboy and prophecy on new voice-more. I make a list of hardships and collection agencies I will escape if I were to die. How soon is now? At night I dream I am a decouple. Developed in a strain of worker bees that automatically died before it. attention-fun fixing. Because the fun don't be amounts to a thimble full of pollen the early death is useful. I wake up in the image of me standing before a sub-meethe, selling a special gas made from my dental molecular-beginetics that can be sprayed on postal employees. I hold a sign that reads, works until drops dead. That's why I'm going to be a part of the world. How do I sustain interest in the world that I'm scheduled not to be a part of the resume?

In Phoma, Ge regret has our small party weighted through the cable, talking along ourselves if you greed for the strength of our last son. I noticed you looking at display of crispies. Heaps of hazelnuts, walnuts, leaves of oregano, bottles, boils on dark wood cutting. You watched the cook chopping up onions and I recognized the look I knew face. Events had equalized for you. You had been called three quarters after working. And I wanted to say what's happening to you is not here. It's not time you stay in your space. But when you are leading the world we understand that it isn't that that is a strong and deep wish. But life. How is this struggling life possible? How are these people possible? How am I possible?
