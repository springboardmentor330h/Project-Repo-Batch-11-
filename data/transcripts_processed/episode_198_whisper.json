  "text": "had to win friends and influence people. First published in 1936, you don't really think you can see why it was in the one. The Akronagi writes in this chapter, style. You don't think of the word Maxi much anymore, but you read this. This is the book. He writes in preparation for writing this book. He read everything he could find on the subject. Then he will solve this step at news. to figure out how the great leaders of all ages that we can call. He says, I recall that we read over 100 by aggregates theater or Roosevelt alone. We would determine to spare no time, no expense, discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the ages, but winning friends and influencing people. Anyway, on a page 61 of the addition that I have, they are kind of, it has one of the many many stories he uses to. It was straight the very mean idea that underwised the whole book says half and went fishing up in name during the summer. Personally, I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I found that for some strange reason fish for worms. So when I went fishing, I didn't think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I'd then go to worm or grasshopper and front of the fish and said, wouldn't you  to have that? Why not use the same common sense in fishing for people? To win friends and influence people, Delk Kyrgyz says over and over in the book, think about what they want. People he says wrongly interested in themselves. And if you can get yourself to the point where you are genuinely interested, now, and what they want, they will  you. And then you do your business. So imagine you are 11 years old. You need to get notices that you are in the house and take you aside. and he's your copy of this actual book. This happened. This happened to Paul Fee, growing up in Spurbin, Michigan. And first I didn't know what to think. First of all, if you ever seen the book, it's got this picture of Dale Carnegie on the front who is somewhere in his 60s or 70s wearing, those misdermanous glasses, and it's the minus of dads. Dad used to wear, it was kind of white, slick back hair. He looked  every guy that was in my dad's cool on his, and didn't seem to me  a guy Hit theACM would have that many friends or much influence over people. He had written the bug. So, my father went on to make this speech basically about how, now that I was getting older, I was loving your school. That's, it was time for me to kind of get social skills that he assumed I didn't have. Now, in school, I've had plenty of friends. He's kind of a class cut-up. This way of winning friends was the same as other. He talked about what they saw on TV and tried to be funny. He was just around the house that he was quiet and pro. But he figured, , you wanted to be more popular. You want to work friends. So he said, try out some of the techniques in the book. And I went through these and, , principle number one was, become genuinely interested in other people. Principal number two was smile. Principal number three was remember that a person's name is to that person. The sweetest and most important sound in any book. language. Yeah, I was wondering about that when in particular, if as an 11 year old you tried to employ that one. Well, the hard thing was when you're 11 years old, the only thing you ever call anybody is by their last name. So I was kind of confused as to whether that sort of applied. And this started a bit of a panic in me because I suddenly didn't know how you would  better if I did that. And so I remember getting the school the next day and my friend Dave Flurry who I'd always call Flurry. I remember going up to going up. Hey David, how's it going? And he can even strangers look. I'll use techniques in the books and try to talk to girls, ask them about themselves, but the dad's it's programming. Just showing interest in them as books suggest. And it kind of freaked them out. Because , kids do not talk  that. And I would sit and lunch with my friends and kind of they would be on a story. And I would want to throw in as I normally would, but kind of when I would know I should sit back, let's go with noise. really attentive and would not. Oh, and it ended then when it did brother do you? Oh, did he punch you really? And what happened? And then I became the sort of mini analyst where I was sort of trying to get kids to tell me their inner most secret. But what happened was my father kept checking it with me at night. He saw a soldier read that book, they have you, if you try to need these things out. So I don't  I need more proof. And I'm happy to take you back. Yes, I need a tangible thing to show my father that I had become popular and was winning friends and influencing people. So when Paul's teacher decided to do this exercise where they elected a cross-president, he ran. And he won. His father, very, very pleased. The book was working. There was this one problem. One of the things I haven't spent on was that as quite... President I actually had to do something. I was so not into this. I was just hating because I just wanted to get back to my life with my friends. Well the teacher was dissatisfied and the students were dissatisfied and the teacher suddenly decided well  what? She got up and she said there's a process in our political system. This country called impeachment. And she looked out she's said, how does everyone feel about our class president's law? What would he say to his father? The whole experience with the Alkhardinti actually left part with fewer friends and the less influence over people. It was confusing. All the ideas that they put into his head. I couldn't get out of my head the fact that my dad had given this to me and the fact that he was so concerned that I didn't have friends. And so I started getting nervous. well maybe he's seen something that I don't know. He was strange. I would start to see things that weren't there,  somebody would sort of laugh at what I say and they turn away to look at something. It's something I was envisioning that as they're turning away with their back to me, they're making the sort of face and rolling their eyes and , mom, idiot. And it started noticing in the teacher that when I would raise my hand and answer a question, I was thinking in our face that kind of was,  she was tolerated. what I'm saying about that is that the book made you act in a way which was completely of phony and calculating and so then the thought and to your head maybe everybody else is acting photocaxulating as well. Yeah, it was almost  I've been given this sort of handbook to the human mind that I didn't want. WB's is Chicago. It's this American life. I'm Eric Glass today on our program.

I was in the snack bar listening to a group of sixth graders who lived in another part of town and sat discussing significant changes in their upcoming school year. According to the girl named Janet, neither Pam Doppens nor JJ Jackson had been invited to the fourth of July party hosted by the High All Twins, who later told Kimberly Naughty about Pam and Mike were out of the pictures as far as seven grade was concerned. Totally completely. out Janet said, hoops. I didn't know any Pam Dobbins or JJ Jackson, but the reverential tone of Janet's voice sent me into a state of mild shock. Tommy Nyey, but it'd simply never occurred to me that other schools might have their own to let them be served. At the age of 12, I thought the group of EC Brooks was, if not nationally known, then at least its own private phenomenon. Why else would our lives around them. I myself was not a member of my school's popular crowd, but we call thinking that whoever they were, Janet's popular people couldn't begin to confuse the boys. Then I worried that our popular crowd couldn't compare to those in Charlotte or Green's furl, not to mention the thousands of schools located in other states. What if I wasted my entire life comparing myself people who didn't really matter? Twice I might, I still can't wrap my mind around it. They banded together in the third grade, and Carlsworth, Christie, came more, depth at them, Mike Hollowell, Doug Middleton, that hope. This was the core base of the popular crowd. And for the next six years, my classmates and I studied their lives the way we were supposed to study math and English. So complete was their power that I actually felt honored with one of them hitting the mouth, the rock. He got me after school and a- returning home I ran into my sister's bedroom hugging my bloody clean-ups and crying it was sad Lisa was a year older but still she understood his knickers did he say anything, chance? Did you save the lock? My father demanded that I retaliate saying I ought to knock the guy on his ass. Oh dad, all aloneing, clock him on the snout locker and he'll go down  a ton of bricks. He was mistaken that for a bully which was a different crowd altogether. Besides, he did my probably think I was. Boys who spent their weekends making banana nut muffins did not as a rule, excel in the art of hand-to-hand combat. I mean, come on dad, Lisa said, wake up! The following afternoon I was taken to Dr. Pavley. a track's race. The rock had damaged him too, and there was some question over who would pay for the subsequent route canal. I figured that since they conceived me, given birth, and raised me as a permanent guest in their home, my parents should put the bill, but my father thought differently. He had decided the pope should pay, and I screamed as he picked up the phone book, but you can't just haul that house. Why the hell not? You said, don't they have a raisle easteruposes? Will of course, the Pope's had Falafone, probably three or four with separate lines with children. I imagine that as a state-of-the-art desk model, the blinking red lights, a learning him that dog or Chris was waiting on, lying one. A equipment was not the issue. My father's voice simply did not belong in the Pope's telephone. It wouldn't fit with their things. A meeting was arranged for the following evening, and before leaving the house, I begged my father to change his quote. He'd been building in addition to the cardboard and more a pair of khaki shorts, smeared with paint and spotted here and there with bits of right concrete. Through a hole in his tattered t-shirt, without squinting, it was possible to see his nipple. What the hell is wrong with this? He asked, when I'd stain for dinner, so what does it matter? I yelled for my mother and in the end who compromised by change, shirt. Inside that house didn't look much different than anyone else. Just the standard split level with what my father described was a totally inadequate cardboard. Mr. Pope answered the door in a pair of Sherbert colored golf pants and light us down stairs into what he called the Wumpus Room. Oh, I said, this is nice. The room was damp and windowless and lit with hanging kiffin' the lampshades, the shards of colorful glass arranged to spell the word. books  Wyser. Walls were paneled and the furniture looked as though it had been hand-hewned by settlers who'd reconfigured parts of their beloved kind of scog a wagon. The fashion such things as easy chairs and coffee tables. He directed us towards the sofa and asked if he wanted anything to drink. Coat up here. I didn't want to deplete that precious coalesce a fly. So before I could refuse, my father said, sure we'd have one of these. The orders were called up a spare way in a few minutes later Mrs. Pope entered the room, carrying cans in plastic tumblers, and as she set the drinks before us, I noticed that her son had a carrot that her blunt slightly up her nose, which looked good on him, but caused her to appear overly suspicious in judgmental. So she said, hi here you've been to the dentist. She was just trying to make small part that good or nose it came off sounding  an insult. This is if I just had a tooth build and was now looking for someone to pay the bill. I'll say he's been to the dentist, my father said, someone hits you in the mouth for the rock and I'd say the dentist office is pretty much the first place in reasonable person would go. Mr. Poet held up his hands. Whoa now, he said, let's just calm things down a little. He held up stairs for his son and when there was no answer, he picked up the phone, telling that I'd just stop running his mouth and get his butt down to the lump. with ASAP. A rush of footsteps on the carpeted staircase and then that sprinted in all smiles and apologies. The minister had called, the game had been rescheduled, hello sir and you are. He looked my father in the eye and firmly shook his hand, holding it in his own for just the right amount of time. With others are aged the gesture appeared forced and sloppy, but that seemed born to it. While most handshake mumble, his clearly spoke. saying, both, we'll get through this, and I'm looking forward to your votes coming November. I thought that seeing him without his group might be unsettling,  finding a single arm on the sidewalk. But that was fully capable of operating independently. Watching him in action, I understood that his popularity was not an accident. Unlike a normal human who possessed an uncanny and... wholly natural ability to please people. Much  a Whitman Sampler, who seemed to offer a little bit of everything. Pass on his athletic ability and you might partake to his excellent men, whose confidence, his coefficient, enthusiasm, even his parents seemed integrated by his presence. All right, then, Mr. Pope, said, now that everyone's accounted for, I'm hoping we can clear this up. Sticks and spellings aside, I suspect this all comes down to work. little misunderstand between friends. I lowered my eyes waiting for that to set his father straight friends with him. I expected laughter or the famous bad snort, but instead said nothing, and with his silence he won me complete. A little misunderstanding, that's exactly what it was. The immediate goal was to save my friend, and so I claimed to have essentially thrown myself in the past. That's the thing, what the hell was he throwing rocks for my father-in-skirt? What the hell was he throwing a mat? Mrs. Pope, crowned, implying that such language was not welcome in the lump of swim. I mean Jesus Christ, the guy's got to be a complete idiot. That's where he hadn't been aiming at anything, and I backed him up saying it was just one of those things we all did. in Vietnam or whatever. It was just fine. fire. My father asked what the hell I knew about Vietnam and again that's mother wins saying that boys picked up a lot of this talk by watching the news. Aw, you don't know what you're talking about my father said. What my wife meant Miss Phot said. All-ball loaning. The trio of hopes exchange meaningful glances holding what amounted to a brief telepathic power. This man crazy smoke signals red. I looked at my father then, a man in dirty shorts who drank his beer from the can rather than pouring it into his comber, and I thought, you don't belong to him. More precisely, I decided that he was the reason I didn't belong. How was the person expected to fit in when he'd been steadily poisoned by his parents? That little doses and how he was ultimately self-contaminated that no one would have anything to do with the Hockey. weak phrases, how to lectures on mixing your own concrete, the swabble over who would pay the stupid dentist bill, little by little it all seat into my bloodstream, robbing me of my natural ability to please others. Well, Mr. Pope said, I can see that this is going nowhere. My father laughed saying, Kia, you got that right. It sounded  parting sentence, but rather than standing to leave, he leaned back on the sofa and threw it down. Soap. And ask of this bill. Panapanisthamic. Where all go in nowhere. At this point I was pretty sure that that and I were envisioning the same Graham scenario. While the rest of the world could move on, many years time might feel the bearded father, it still be occupying the lumpus room so far. Christmas would come. Friends would visit and the pokes would bitterly direct them for each one of the easy chairs. Let's ignore him. Let's say. He'll go home sooner or later. In the end, they agreed to pay for half the loose now, not because they thought it was fair, but because they wanted to have their house. Some friendships are formed by a commonality of interests and ideas. You both love judo or camping or making your own sausage. Other friendships are forged by a mutual hatred of common enemy. I'm leaving that house. I decided that ours would probably be the one. ladder. We'd start off browsing about my father, maybe going so far as the scratch at his car, and then little by little we'd move on to the hundreds of other things and people that got on our nerves. You hate olives, I imagine you're saying, I hate them too. I just turned out the one thing we both hated was me. Other I hated me. That could need to work up the enthusiasm. The day after the meeting I approached him in the lunchroom where he sat at his regular table surrounded by his regular friends. Listen, I said, I am really sorry about that stuff with my dad. I'd worked up a whole long speech, complete with limitations. But by the time I hit my second sentence, he turned to resume his conversation with the middle of him. I occurred to your testimony. My father's behavior, even the rocks growing. I was so far beneath him that it hadn't even registered. The social likes of EC Brooks show even brighter in June the high, but come 10th grade things began to change. These aggregations grow a lot of the popular phone-to-five of schools, and those remain seem silly in Arcade. They pose royalties from a country, the average citizen who ceased to care about. Early in our junior year, that was jumped by a group when we blacked it, some young copies shoes and threw them in the toilet. I knew I was supposed to be half. the part of me felt personally assaulted. Yes, he felt a negligent prince. Yet I still believed in the monarchy. When his name was called at graduation, it was me who clapped along us. Outlasting even his parents who politely stopped once he left the stage. I thought about that a lot of the coming years. He's the poet laureate of Lichtenstein. The surgeon who threw his cancer with love, the ninth. teacher who insists that the world's big enough for everyone. When moving to another city, I'm almost hoping to find him living in the apartment next store. We'll meet in the hallway and how Strikotters' hands saying, excuse me, but don't I? Shouldn't I know you? It doesn't have to happen today, but it does have to happen. I've kept the space waiting for him. And if he doesn't show up, I'll have to forgive my father. Give to the rest, put the Detroit Institute of Art, kind of a UDET, he's got many fine books he's going on tour, find that when he's coming to your town at davidsadarisbooks.com. Coming up, it's okay if you're not Superman. Unless of course your girlfriend used to date Superman, that's in minute, which is talk about the video. I'm gonna open the screen. This American life from our glass. It's gonna be gonna be a question to something. bring you up a variety of different kinds of stories on that. Today's show, how to win friends and influence people. We have four lessons on the subject. We have arrived at lesson two. Stay in touch. Since a Pemper 11, the United States of America has faced some special challenges in trying to win friends and influence people among world nations. There was a whole attempt to rally countries at the United Nations against Saddam Hussein. And then after that, the events of the nation to join us in a war against Iraq. look at even before all that, in the very beginning of the war on terror. When US diplomats had to start working the phones to assemble a coalition of nations to begin to combat this and threat. Some of the cause you get to feel  were not the easiest kind of phone calls to make. Countries that were mad at us for one reason or another. Countries that we'd acted out interested in for a while in the past and then just kind of stop calling. Back in the late 2001, you may remember you kept seeing Secretary of State call on Palin the paper saying things , are sudden new interests in Pakistan. wasn't quote to contemporary spike in American interest, but we had quote and enduring commitment and the Pakistan was quote a great Muslim nation. What were those first phone calls ? Well, all the way back in 2001, one of our contributors, Amy Seger, tried to imagine exactly that. How are you, Pakistan? It's America. How are you? I knew I knew I got... I almost didn't recognize your voice. And so... Listen... I was just getting to whether this little coalition. And I was , oh, who have I not seen for a pack of stand? Oh, yeah. What? Oh, oh, you have cash, man. That's yours, right? Oh, you're kidding me. And when I think of cash, man, I think of yours. That's here. Just try out a pack of standing camera. Oh, god. Well, we will see you at the coalition, then. Oh, I can't believe I've got this. I also wondering maybe if you could bring along some full exchange of intelligence and use of ports. No big deal, if you forget, but if you do, that would be great. All right. See you soon. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. No, I have been thinking about calling you  every night. I was , got a call in the up. the time difference. Oh, how are you? How's Kazoo? You're kidding. No. Come on. That's yours, isn't it? So how are you listening and getting together a little colorless? Well, I know if you'd be up to the drawing of packing it. Oh, okay. So, I didn't think I'd call you now. What? do you want me to? Is that well? Oh, I don't know. I don't care. This is about you, India. Yes, it is. Okay. Okay, we'll see real soon. Love you. Is that weird? You say, don't feel weird. Okay. Bye-bye. Hello. I mean, I'm interested in, I am. I am, I am, I am. I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it, I feel so good to talk. See you again. I know we haven't talked. God's such a hostage called, so that was just... Well, , it was one of those things where it was just, , it was easier to just stay away than just sort of repair myself a little bit, so I'm not just figured you're in the same promise. No. Maybe I'll see, maybe I'll fly overhead in there, so it's okay. Well, freak out if I do. Alright. That piece fell. Hello, China. Hi, it's America. Hi. Okay. I am, this is hard. I wanted to apologize. About the pain, yes, I'm so sorry. Yeah, and about the embassy blew up and about the fishing boat. Oh my god, you write it, Mr. P. I'm so, ah, no, you do not look alike. I'm sorry, no, that is me being a big fat jerk. I'm so sorry. Well now I feel  twice. Okay, listen, I am getting together coalition and wondering if you could stop for it. Oh good, no, I know what, yeah, I know you share a border with a Palestinian stand, so I don't want that to be weird. I'm not right now. But if you could come that would be great. Okay, really look forward to seeing you. what I'm betting an hour, I'm going to want to call you again. I know I make it every time. Okay, I'll take you through. Bye. Tell me, Sager, formerly of Chicago's second city. She's now a writer in the TV show, 30 Rock. I'm using three people  you. You put a lot of time into your appearance. Through this simple point, we have this true story of Marlond Struction, pulled by Luke Burbank, and that's something that happened to them years ago. I was in the Las Vegas airport when I noticed this guy dressed  Superman. I'm talking red boots, blue spandex leggings, a yellow belt, a big ass on his chest, and of course a long red cape. I was struck by how authentic the outfit was. And the fact that he didn't have any baggage, no suitcase, no backpack, no wallet, no keys, you look calm and happy and sort of out of place. Since I was in Las Vegas, I figured he was some performer, one of the casinos, who was running late and didn't have time to change or something. I didn't think too much more about him until I was getting on the plane and noticed that there was much more excitement in the air than I'm used to on a flight home from Las Vegas. They were talking about his guy dressed as Superman. he was sitting right behind. At one point the copilot got on the inner car and announced the Superman's hotel at call and that he'd left his Pokemon the Jamies in his room that they wanted to know where to send them. Everyone cracked up including me. But Superman didn't say anything. Just sat there with a slight smile on his face. During the flight the steady stream of guys on their way to the bathroom would ask a Superman what do you need to complain for. Women tend to ask why he had the costume on. Generally, he kept his answers short and polite. He didn't parade around the plane or call extra attention to himself. And I remember thinking that he seemed pretty normal for a guy in a Superman costume. My friends and I came up with a theory that he lost that. So when the plane stopped over in San Jose, I decided to talk to him. His real name is Mark Wison B. I met with him a week later, his condo in Auburn, Washington. A suburb about 20 minutes south of Seattle. Obama , hey, Biden, Obama, Obama, wasn't wearing the costume when I showed up and I asked him how he actually did. Every weekend I get a chance to put it on, I'll put it on. Every day that I don't have too much schedules, I'll pop it on. A lot of times I can't wait to pop it on because  as soon as someone's seizure, their day is different, they've got a story to tell and a sudden that they're always going to remember. And I'll guarantee you that the pilot on that flight that you're on. he's still talking about this that he had soup in and on his point. Yeah, by the way, did that didn't get on your nerves and they said that thing about your Pokemon pajamas? Nah. You get, you get you say, and it's, it's, , I don't see it as a cut, but more compliment that they even mentioned to the whole plane that that Superman was on that floor. This two bedroom apartment is filled, and I mean. filled with Superman memorabilia, Superman dishes, Superman sheets on the bed, Superman Mouse Man, Golf Tees, Paper Clips, you name it. In the living room, just to the right of the TV, Hank 5 Superman costumes side by side, then there are the Batman masks, probably 8 of them, sitting on dummy heads. It feels  a locker room for superheroes. He started dressing a Superman 2 years ago after his wife died in a car accident. button  never. We're had anyone real close to me, pass away before your grandparents, they've lived a full life in your expecting app, but someone's so young and beautiful with their whole life ahead of them. It just really hit me that she doesn't have any more tomorrow's, and I thought, well, I better start getting as much out of today each today as I can. What would help you do that? And I enjoy wearing the costumes, and I just could... I've been waiting to out somewhere and have a bunch of people see it and it's just been real kick out of our sense. Do you remember the first time you wore it out in public? What was that ? When I completed my first costume, I had to go down, put some gas in the car. And I climbed out of the car and I put them up the oil in the car's pulling up to the signal we're going. and that's when I knew right then that I'm on to something. This is gonna be a lot of fun. And the neat thing is, is when they hawn catch you, they're all looking, and you hear this talking, they're all up there, super, and they're super. And the neat thing is, is they won't stop hawn until you look at them. They have to have that eye contact with you, knowing that they're looking at you, and that you see them looking at you, and then the whole cycle's complete, and then everyone's having a good time. Mark had always been the collector of Superman's stuff, but after his wife died he decided to go for brook and spend most of his money on an original costume from the TV show Superboy. He's only tried that costume on once, and was too special to wear outside. Instead, he taught himself how to sew and started making his own Superman outfits, which frankly, I thought were better looking than the one thought. Mark also owns a Batman. costing the George Kumi actually war in the Batman movie. He wears Superman in the summer and Batman in the winter. The Batman outfit is made of foam rubber and his warmer, which he needs, because it doesn't to cover the costume with the coat when it goes outside. But here's the super boy costume, S.E. and on TV by millions, one by a guard Chris for he was, he took over the show in the second year through the fourth year they had a different actor, the first year. But as you can see, the seam along most of the yellow here is hidden except for these three areas. And , March attention to detail when it comes to his outfits is incredible. He says that authenticity is the key to being taken seriously. If it wasn't 100% then I would be letting down the costume. I'd be letting down the people looking at it. You can get your little $40 in the Halloween costume once that is great for the office at theHa Raust. but to ground public unless you look  you're right off the movie screen then then I don't suggest that you do it because you'll be a joke. Does it feel  have you replaced your wife or the boy that you're wife passing left? You replaced that a little bit with your pursuit of the Superman and Batman stuff. It definitely takes you mind off with any kind of a diversion or activity instead of thinking about things she'd lost is always plus. The costumes to be able to wear those in public, I don't know exactly how she would have taken it. I miss her a lot. I think of her every day, but the way I think of her now is that I just have a feeling that that's... out there and that she's helping with this. Two or three times a week, Mark goes to bars in costume. I asked if I could go with him to see for myself. He suits up and we climb into his car, a white 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix, customized Superman plates. Oh, this hop in the Superman mobile here, yes, you can see that my license plate. So you've got the apps. Superman floor mats. Formats. I got the little hang and flying thing here. I have a little paston logo on my suit and heel. I notice you put down a t-shirt, is that so your boots don't get scuffed? Yeah, I just want to scuff the back. there. Now, I was gonna get a vet, but then the work I needed a back seat. That while I just get something that's spunky in. corners and so where is the sun is flying. So where do you figure superman wants to go on a night  tonight? DEEZ on a Monday night. Yeah, sure. Oh, we can head down to a couple of local places here. I don't know how busy they're going to be. Auburn where Mark lives is not exactly a hotbed of nighttime. activity. It's claimed a fame is that you drive through it to get to the areas only in IKEA. At night your options are fast food or a sports box. We go to a sports box. As we got closer, I started to get nervous. I worried we were going to get laughed right out of the place. Mark and I were  anti-superheroes. He, a grown man dressed Superman. Me, a grown man following him around with headphones and a shotgun microphone. He was  super geek and I was rich likeματα. We pulled up the sports page up. Mark was excited. I was worried. He was the kids, guys. I have a fun man. Man is still. Yeah. Woo! He was surprised. He was Monday, so the bar was only about half full. Most of the people were in their 20s, and they were playing cool. A lot of them had tattoos and piercings. Mark said the crowd looked a little young. He said the outfit does best with people over 40. people who grew up Superman. How about a diet coke in the coke cruise? Mark, it doesn't drink. It gets a soda and goes straight for the area with the most people. In this case, over by the pool tables, he stands there with his diet coke and waits for people to approach. How do the first six people we talked to who are at the same question? You got a sock in there? I'm just getting Superman. That's real. I started to feel really protective of Mark. I wanted to. to everybody to story of his wife dying. I wanted them to  him, but even though I thought things were going badly, Mark was enjoying himself, sipping his co and feeling in questions about the cost. I should point out that Mark's in pretty good shape. He looks good in the cost. After we'd been there about 20 minutes, we decided to leave. On the way out, we bumped into a group of guys sort of blocking Texas. You're a weirdo-wings, guys. The guys stood chest to chest with Mark first. Mark had told me he'd never had anyone tried to beat him up before, and I was thinking this might be the first time. Then before I knew it, the guy was giving Mark a hug, not a full blown hug. It was one of those, I'm not gay, side hugs, the guy is giving each other. Still it was a pretty big change of attitude for someone who seemed ready to fight 30 seconds earlier. He was saying, dude, it takes a lot of guts to wear that. That sucks about your wife. Look up in the way! Yeah. Hey! When people talk to him  this, Mark chocks it up to the cost. But I'm not sure that I agree. I think they actually  him in spite of the cost. He's out there all vulnerable with no defenses and no aggression. And he's excited to be in Spandex leggings and a superhero case. I don't know all the class one liners. I don't know the all the trend ice breakers. You can go into a bar and you can get fly in a water. and just look and watch everyone's doing and be yourself and not really have to interact with a lot of people. You can turn around and go into that same place with a costume on and everyone just passed the interact with each other. It helps that he doesn't seem to notice when people laugh at the cost. He assumes that everyone who approaches him is into his out and it's kind of a self-fulfilling costume. He acts  they're into it and so we act nice and when someone acts so nice it wins them all Look, we're bang these days. He's trying to reinvent news talk radio The show called two beautiful live just available as three podcasts at the iTunes store And now the final lesson of our show, lesson 4, just be yourself. Some people are very clear that they are not Spamman and they are at peace with that. And so what if  that you are just yourself, just regular size, no special powers. They have the story of one such man who's  the superpowers is pushed into his face all the time because of circumstances that will come out to clear to you. Jonathan Goldstein, Puzzles Square. She missed normal men. Lowest wanted some normal. I'm not going to say I want over a class act  Lowest Late through anything other than the fact that I was a normal mortal. She had had her fill of the night rides over Metropolis on Superman's back. She had done the demystifying, I'm letting you get to know the real me trips to the fortress of Solitude. He had even taken her to Niagara Falls to see the statues made of wax that honored him there, and because she insisted they took the train. He would turn to her and say, who of any idea how ridiculous this is for me, and then he would laugh. He would laugh because he loved her, and despite all of this, she had decided to leave him. I first met Lois at a charity penny arcade event. At one point in the evening as I stood hunched over a pinball machine, I looked over to my side and there was Loisley, just standing, watching her. The left flipper wasn't working, so I tried to keep the ball in the middle. right, but when it came down on the left, together with Yel at a couple of kids, well, we're down the side of her mouth. I've always wanted to reach in there, hold the silver ball in my hand, I said. I never thought of it that way, said Lois. In five minutes later, she was ripping open an empty pack of chlorettes and writing her number down on the white team side. Lois was kind of woman I had always dreamed of. Lois? This was the kind of woman who made you feel  I am a man who dates low asleep and as simple as all that sounds, it's the best way I can describe it. At first I was an awful thing, in the beginning lowest would kiss my forehead and tell me she loved how squishy my arms were. In a good way she'd say, they're so easy to fall asleep on. I wasn't embarrassed by my softness. In fact all the things my old girlfriends found on a attractive and gross about me, lowest time. Once I drew eyelashes above me. nipples and smeared lipstick around my belly button. Lowest swoon does I make my fat gut, singer-sweet songs, glow. I  making lowest lap. One evening I purchased the jar of all it simply because one of them, pressed up against the glass, looked  an old man, a little stroke-mouth full of pmento. I gave him a voice. I made him say things , get me outta here, and my ass is asleep. Lowest appear to find this delightful. Although they were broken up, low-sum Superman decided to remain friends. And since they traveled in the same circles, I knew it was only a matter of time before Superman and I would meet. And I knew that when we did, by any possible system of measurement, he would destroy me. Lowes told me that I should expect a call from Superman one of these days, because he was really anxious to meet me. And several weeks into our relationship, I got the call. When I answered the phone. I felt my chest heightened. Look, I'd  to keep loas in my life he said. And I guess that means we should get to know each other. And I want to make this into a big deal. The lowest tells me you're between jobs right now. And I could use a psyche. I'm trying to change my image. I don't want to come off such a lone wolf anymore. It would be part time, and I could teach you a thing or two. Look, don't get me wrong, I said. You do great things. Wonderful things. And what do I do? Who would I do? If I make it to the post office to buy stamps before noon, it's a miracle. Silence, he said, cutting me off. But he didn't say it in the way you'd think, I'll cap it a letters. Set it quietly. Sadly, almost. Silence. Just think about it. When I saw low was that night for dinner, she had already spoken to Superman, and she was going on about my side kick, she had black was already a done deal. It's just what you need to get back on the workforce, she said. And she looks so pleased, before I knew it. I was drinking glass after glass of red wine, promisinger that it really was no big thing. Lois is just so beautiful when she's pleased. The next morning I met Superman for lunch, and before I could sit down in the booth, he handed me a rumpled paper bag. What's this I asked? Your new outfit he said. He showed me off to the bathroom and in the toilet start, changed into what was essentially a skin. high-black unitor. It was no cave. The whole thing succeeded in making looks any  it in Roton. Across the chest, in small, new career font, was the word steward. I pointed to the name as I walked back to the table. It's your sidekick name Superman said. And you're not supposed to wear underwear with your uniform. I spent most of my time. wearing my steward outfit in his apartment, ironing his costume, fielding calls from the press, and popping boils on his back with a nail and an almanac. And in between Superman had me doing nonstop sit-ups. He called my gut to crime against humanity. His favorite joke was what his hand on my stomach and asked, how many months? But he wasn't perfect either. From up close Superman's tank, real cream. And he had this way of getting when he was being all solid, where he would use words  chow and vex. Also, he's really full of himself. But through all of his talk, I would try to maintain eye contact with him. And as I did, who would think to myself, I have seen Lois in her underwear. And tonight, when I go home, I might see her in her underwear some more. I wouldn't put it past the bastard to read minds. As horrible as it all got in the evening, there was Lois. And she seemed so proud of me. but still, Superman was always an unspoken presence between us. I always knew he was out there, feeling better than me. And when I looked at Lois sometimes, a new she knew I was thinking it. And I guess it sort of made her want to think about it a little herself. It all came to her head one Thursday night. There was this Thursday night tradition where all the superheroes got together for a few years, she can wait. And on this particular Thursday night, Lois was going to join us. The superheroes would sit together. at one table, capes all undone, laughing, slapping each other on the back, while the site kicks out over at another table, commiserating and trash talking. I looked around my table. It was an angry looking hunchback the green lantern worked with, and wonder woman had brought along a sad-eyed, mousy college aged girl who sat sketching on napkins all night. The flash had taken on this grizzled old sack of bones of smell of cabbage and urine that he called Benjamin. Superman told me that Benjamin was the flashes dad with a mother at risk. thrown out. The flash was afraid that if he left him alone, he'd commit suicide. So he put him in a leotard and took him around with him, mostly leaving him in the car. And then of course there was Batman's sidekick, Robin. I looked over at them, Superman and Batman, the best of buddies, and I imagined what their conversation was on the nighty limb being lowest. It was as I sat there, imagining the two of them laughing at me. Their massive upper torso's jerking in a manner that is impossibly manly. that I saw a lowest walk through the door. Superman caught a ride and she made a bee line right over to him. Instinctively, I rose from my seat. Superman turned to me and our eyes locked. Much has been written about Superman, but there is an aspect to him that is very difficult to describe. There's a certain feeling when gets when looking into his eyes, and of all the articles I've read, there's nothing that touches on it. It's inhuman and hypnotic, but it's not just that. Being looked at by Superman makes you feel more there than anything, even a dozen TV cameras. And it's not simply that you're there, but that you're there swaddled in layers of reassuringly moist and tellelettes. It's comfy and cozy, and I cannot explain it well enough. As she kissed Superman's cheek, blow, I turned around and walked out of the bar. Because I was in my steward outfit, I didn't even have pockets to dig my fists and Sometimes after one in the morning low was showed up at my place full of apologies. She had gone over to sit with me, but I had already left. He spent the whole night talking with Superman. She said that he's been really depressed. I've never seen him  this, she said. I'm actually a bit worried. He's obsessed with the emptiness of the universe. He said that after two weeks or so. broke up, he went looking for God, literally looking for God, zipping across the universe, and he came back with nothing. I wasn't in the mood for a big Superman as a man of constant sorrow routine, but he was clearly on a roll, and I didn't have the heart to stop her. I never realized I would obsessively convey, and he said, he told me there was once a certain way I flipped my hair that so begiled him, he spun around the earth reversing the moment 75,000 times. I never knew that. I felt my shit. himself almost throw up. He's just so intense she continued. And this planet can be so cool. Did  that on Krypton when two people fell in love, they became inseparable, and they learned to move together in units. They even had special clothes they wore. He said that on earth these kind of garments had names  fun deeds, and were only sold in the pages on a graphic magazines. Superman says the earth is a 6-6 place. My fear wasn't that low as we'd get back together with Superman, because by this point, I knew it was only a matter of time before she would. But that she would describe the summer we spent together as the most miserable, depressing, and disgusting time of her life. I already knew how it would infuriate. I could hear him making stupid job jokes in there. You don't need supervision to see through that, sir. You'd say. I can't believe it... She went home, I decided to take a walk and clear my head. I did so while cursing Superman until there were tears in my eyes. I had only walked a couple of blocks when I ran into Clark Kent. I had been introduced to Clark in a couple of low-assess swarrays, and although I hardly knew it, he was someone I really liked. He possessed what I felt from my certified one-view, whose genuine small-town warmth, and I just enjoyed being round up. He told me I looked terribly sad. Terribly sad. People didn't say stuff  that anymore. Having him called me terribly sad instead of the press or bummed, made me already start to feel a little bit better. He asked me if I wanted to grab a beer, and I said sure. I told Clark all about the eating and getting listened to me. That was all I really needed just that. Be listened to. Had  she'll go running back to Superman, as Clark? He said here the way she talks I said. Do you have any idea how much Superman can bench press? Superman wins. when back in time to beat up Hitler. I mean, who can compete with that? Clark started laughing so hard, people at the other tables turned around to look at us. I was on a roll. With his laughter, eggy neon, I told him all the things that over the last few weeks I wish they had said to Superman. You're such a phony, I said. You have this idea of what it means to be human, but it's a parody. Humans feel pain, and you don't understand what pain is. You may be super. Please. were certainly not a man. Clicked out that was just perfect. He put his arm around my neck and rocked me back and forth, and we both laughed and laughed. Jonathan Goldstein is the host of the CBC show WireTap.
