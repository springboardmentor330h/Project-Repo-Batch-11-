  "text": "Three years old children have a hard time to get to see from reality. By five or six they operate in both worlds. By the time they attend their late-spec children to be able to distinguish what's real from what isn't. Processed became adult in time. It's a process of learning to talk and truth about world. The time the truth is not always so easy. When she was ten years old, her so it's schools moved to a rich suburb, family didn't have much money. She became best friends with the girl in the summer and integrated in Chile. Of course, no, it was just a little bit. It wasn't really  when we would hang out together that I would idolize her that she was  the boss. But , what would go home and I would make up these songs, batter, and I'd  make up songs about the letters of her name. She'd  a really Spanish sounding name. And her phone number, I would just dial it over and over and over again. And I'd make songs, batter, phone number. Because it's just  everything in batter, it was  golden to me. It was just , absolutely. I don't know perfectly, I can be beautiful. Claire dressed  the Chilean girl. We're only the modest jewelry that I can't remember about. The man did the Sunday school and got first communion with the Chilean girl. And then Claire started to talk to me that she was Chilean himself. She said, the her family put a dictatorship. Started over in America. Her family was  a friend's family. I think it was because she was really poor. my family was... but she was  such a different kind of poor. She was  the good, righteous poor. It wasn't her fault or her family's fault that they were poor. It was  political oppression and circumstances that made them poor. And they were good, , people and my family, it was  violence and it was drinking and their family, , mom, kept a good house and my family always had  a really messy house. She was , , really messy house. and it just it wasn't her fault that she was more weird for her because you had her fault. Why do you lie? Sometimes you lie because your power was to do anything else. And who was more power was than a ten-year-old child? It definitely carried me through that time. It definitely gave me a sense of  a sense of pride. It's so weird that you feel pride and something  that. it you're not and there was just no other way except to lie about it there were things that were totally unmovable and unchanged all which is  so kid and the fence of it was and there was a thing I could do about it. When summer, when I went to a Bible street in Wisconsin mother and her brother, she pretended to go up in Venezuela. It was so natural, Chris said , for being the two way off. Yes, I told her that I was from there and that I didn't speak Spanish very well because I wasn't actually born there that I came here when I was a baby or something that my family was from there. So obviously she was going to meet my mother and my brother who spoke not a word of Spanish and didn't look at all, , Central or South American, but I remember she was lots of Nazis moves down there and let . She's blown here and she looks the part. So yeah, that's what happened. And I kind of just decided that my mom was determined to send into a relative, some Nazi or something, and that's where you're from, and that we moved back here because of political oppression. This is how far it went. It was preprovable for people to think that they were Nazis. And to think that we're low income people just living in a rich suburb of Chicago. And one of the most important things about these lies, is a question. they didn't feel  lies in the pond. Since she felt  she was telling people about a part of herself, a real part of herself. , I convinced somebody else for just a little while and I could believe it too. Well from WB EZACH CODO and Public Radio International, it's this American life, I'm Eric Glass. Today on our program, Truth and Lies at H10, today we're going to two stories, but people going to themselves, behind because they thought they had no choice. and how they slowly came to face two, which took decades. Stay with us. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Back one. I, Danny. How to deal with rejection? Was something so crimeless being told no, being told you not wanted here? , people spend years going over what happened, thinking it through, turning it over and over in their heads. Wonder if they could have done anything different. Trying to make sense. Go ahead and get him and got kind of cataclysmic rejection music boy and powerless to do much house He liked about it in this story he returns to the scene Can and Just makes sense This is about a lie a lie. I tell almost to this day, but not after this Anyway, I'm Dan Getterman Danny, and I was in the first cast of the TV show Zoom Chances are, Zoom is either something we've never heard of or something you can't forget. And it's probably the only TV show remembered for its address. And it's probably the only TV show remembered for its address. And it's probably the only TV show remembered for its address. Zoom was a public TV show from kids and 70s, produced by WGBH and Boston and aired all over the country. For those of you who never heard of Zoom, there's little contents. and television historian David Cleaning. Zoom was really the first children's television program to put children at center stage to tell them their ideas, their works, their creativity was very important. They gave them a chance to submit ideas for the program to submit artworks, to submit to them. Pretty much anything that they thought was important in their lives, and then it might appear on the air. But one interesting thing about Zoom as a generational identifier, it's one of those programs where if you walk up to people. who are of that age who did grow up with Zoom and say the name they'll sing the theme song back to. Okay, here goes. Come on in Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom. Come on in Zoom, Zoom, Zoom. We're going to remember constantly singing the theme. People who know it show great enthusiasm they're willing to do the burn-and-dette butterfly thing or risk singing. Boston, so to one, three, four, I still have it. Oh, two, one, three, four, his own. It was such a big part of my life and I remember. I  the first time I ever saw kayak with my own dino. And I was just dying to be friends with the kids on the show or be one of them. Oh, come on in soon, soon, soon, soon, soon. We're gonna soon, let's see, let's see. That was , that was as much a playground as we can stick together. I'm going to say in the sky. Bring around the rose instrument. May be said, why hi. Oh, two, one, four. Three, four. Yeah. Oh, two, one, two, four. Senate is here. No, I'm not Senate. And on and zoom. And on and zoom. And on and zoom. And on and zoom. And on and zoom. Okay. So, surprise it to say, the purposes of this story at least. Zoom was a big deal. And if you were cast members. you were things. Zoom was again every week and don't ever recall watching it with you though. Now that I think about it, I don't recall ever watching that show of you. Maybe it's too painful. Do you watch it? Yeah, I watched it. That's my best friend Adam. He's right. It was me. I guess I better tell you my line. I wasn't really a first cast of Zoom. I was almost in the first test of Z. They actually cast in the Nikka. I can't tell you how horrible this was for a team to all kid, but I guess I can try. That's what I'm doing here. Here's what happened. Or at least what I think happened. Memory can protect you from the crude symptoms. I'm sitting in the dining room with my parents' house talking to my parents about ZU and ZU and dining room table. To reconstruct my memory, I tried talking to my parents first. Now I think he told me that he liked certain qualities that you had. One of them was being very forthright. Here's my dad telling me what he recalls about how I talked to the Zoom producer Chris Sarsin during the audition process. But some of the things that you said, whether they ticked him off about, I don't know, but to our members, that you said that they were wearing rugby shirts. And when he asked you what to do. think of the rugby shirts you said they suck. That was what 12, 10, and those days they were very precocious. I don't know, maybe it was popular in two, but in any case, I was embarrassed not because of the word, but just I thought, oh, they goes the farm. And the other one was the name of the show and apparently you had told us Chris that You thought that some was not a very good idea that it was kind of colonial and being over And you suggested I don't know if you gave them a number idea But you you suggest that they jeans and they shoot those those are two things are My father apparently remembers means somewhat of a pain in the ass and I suspect he's right I was a bit of a show and say a show off. I certainly liked attention I got in the zoom audition the first place through it sure  home-skit. My dad, my brother and I did round family tape recording. Look  it was all set. I think that I'm sure that I was telling everybody that you wouldn't be in it this was very beginning, so I think I'm very first. Do you recall it all my excitement about this? I remember being in the kitchen right around with sinkers. Was it night? And I was having a little fantasy in my head about what type of house to buy? Okay, what type... house I would buy you with the in my mind the millions of dollars that we're going to be coming in from doing this show I was sort of imagining  different styles of houses and that and we're going to be so proud of me because I was going to move you into this house   Elvis did with his parents. So this wasn't just a case of me wanting you. to be famous. I wanted the money too. I thought I was going to be Jolly Foster, Sonny Wittick, my family's there. My dad had been laid off from his engineering job and our family was coming out of pretty hard times in the early 70s or at least it seemed that old to me and it was him. I thought I could save me. I was banking on it but then it fell apart and this is where it gets easy. I know I invented some stories to protect myself. But now I cannot exactly number which wants and my parents couldn't help. So I decided to embark on a search for the truth about my past. Even though it had been 25 years, I figured what to help. I contact the members of that first cast of this. I continue to be recognized up to my third year college. I was registered and why you. , I was stopped at the front door with someone directly. Let's join. I- called him up in New York where he's a playwright man and approaching middle age all of us. This is him 25 years ago. I thought John could shed some light on my history because it was part of the reason the list is I remember the Chris the producer cut and from the past and then Chris told me, I'm afraid we've decided internally that we need to add another girl to the cast. Oh, there's too many, we had five boys and two girls. Nina and Nancy. And what Chris told me was that you and John are both sort of little song and dance in here. And so we've just sort of arbitrarily decided that John will work out better than you. I can't believe it's said that. I cannot believe they said. And then said to me, but we're going to roll the cast over a few months and bring a new kid and we would  it to be involved. But my recollection is that I turned down the opportunity to be in the second cast out of youthful hubris. I felt so humiliated. So I still can title this piece  misery. I think I felt , , I hit my shot, I blew it, I'm no good, boy God. Yeah, all at age 10. Your life is over in age 10. John was sympathetic and I appreciated that, but he didn't remember any of the sins. No reason he should, I suppose. Why don't you go ahead and open up the package again? He and I were in different studios for this interview and I had sent him a photo of the video. And while we were talking on phones. to see if he even remembered me. Oh my gosh. Oh, the hell little we are. Oh, it's in love. Now this really brings back how young we are. Ah! Now this is, this is you with the blonde hair? Yeah. , yeah. Does it bring any balance on her? Here, in your, in your suit. I'll take that as no. Yeah, I really, , I feel kinda bare-ass. Well, look  you're a really cute kid. You should have been there. I didn't too much, I wasn't too much. I'm too. I'm eating up. I'm getting. I'm getting. I'm getting. I have still had a big shake stuff from Baguio to save. Next, I went to visit Joe another kid from the first cast and all the cut list, now we were in. Must have been in every single newspaper United States with life magazine, time magazine, just what I wanted to hear was a great experience. It's on my CV. No. Absolutely. But on my CV now, I know my job's. It's a psychiatrist. Now Joe is a child psychiatrist. Isn't that perfect? I remember Joe was a nice kid. Very magnetic. I just remembered you were blonde. And you were fun. And it seemed good fit. And I was convinced that... were on the show. We all were. But , I guess we were never back together. Now we didn't. Not until now, all these years later. Talking to Joe, it was , it couldn't help myself. Being a psychiatrist and all, I began to confess. All the kids in my school, I remember the making announcements over the PA system that I was on Zoom. And I was treated, , for a brief period of time from being rather a prohaya. to being a celebrity and then back again lower because the kids felt  I had  that lie or something and the year after my whole Zoom deal really grew up and since then I'm sure I want to appear where I told some things about my experience. Can't it bequees of my mind to what you ? Step down you iron. quite a bit. I think that you actually of everybody involved in Sweden probably have the most you've been spending and I can see this really dead stream. Listen, he's treating me. There you're given the prize and then, sorry you're disqualified. This is tough for anybody, especially at home. In the house of desibles, is made with into this room. There you are. Are you good? Aren't you good? Are you telling me that aren't you telling me? What is this? , I'm not the right sex. I was a girl. I would be able to do this. So I think you're, I don't envy your position. This is a tough situation, tough experience. Joe told me that maybe I've been recreating this past in my relationships. Where I might be loved by someone, but I'm always thinking that they could change inside. So I don't want to bother you. And I told him about how I had one set of memories, which I was the one who told Zoom that I didn't want to be a part of it. My guess is if she created this memory where you blew our zoons. And I'm going to be just laughing and we say, don't you think? It's a little annoying, but it's an incredible experience. is the chair. This unique. I didn't have. God. Listen, I'm sorry. Two things I was hoping to do before I walked out the door. One of which probably just, , that's this pretty often. Where if you could autograph your picture here? When I asked Tommy, listen, I'm getting his autograph. Why? Because he's famous. He's Joe. I'm sorry, Tommy. Well, I mostly remember speaking to you with a phone  often during that period, I guess, that you would kind of wise crack it and kind of show busy kind of person that I seem to get along with pretty well. As I do gravitation towards show this for me. even though that's Tommy another zoom from the first test he was actually my best friend of that group we talked all the time on phone we were auditioned show put a stamp out you would look in the bucket of light didn't you? yeah showed us a no-one talking about put an envelope without a doubt no didn't take a tight right or pencil or pen you make up steak you would get I got a real kick out of reminiscing  this. Let me feel  I was still part of things in hell. Tommy really tried to make me feel better. He called me the Pete Best of Zoom, which didn't really help that much, but I knew his heart was in the right place. But what I wanted to know from him was, was he great being in the Zoom key? What did I miss? Was he great being being? Well, I'm sure that, , babe, must've been from my head. So he's one kisser. So how great run. Just the fact that you're on TV people look up to you. Since the fact that you're on TV is always  this. One of the biggest things you can do with America doesn't matter how what kind of other achievements you can get. Tommy and some of the others from that first zoom cast went on to try to make it big. They did a commercial TV show and record. It's nothing really hand out. Our parents kind of kept the ball rolling and got  a lounge bed. They have the... try to play live. Then things just kind of started to sizzle. , the things started sizzling down, they sizzled down pretty quick. Tommy's a video cameraman now. He loves the work, but he still wants to be a rock star. In fact, he gave me a compilation to him, of all the bands he's been over the years. Hoping I might use it on this show. The long-term effects of this, , looking back now, you're 39, so I... It's been 25 years. How has Venus and Kid affected you long time? It's created by dream working to this. Dream that I pursued to this day. So it was very heavy. It was a lie about the truth. We really had a crush to come up with something to say. Better well-known, Chief. I don't care how many degrees you have. How could you wear a house by you? If you run Zoom, that's where people know you throw. So I'll just accept that fact, move on. Kind of depressing. I can feel a little better though. When I go home from talking to Tom, I listen to his tape. Once you've done it, it debunks the mistake. Because in real life terms, what it meant was, you really couldn't walk down the street without being right. So, this is what you're going to do. This is John again. There were certain events that were sort of traumatizing  being robbed. But a year ago you've gone to mall and buy your shoes. Yeah, with friends and suddenly, hey, there is John, and then three more, three people coming, of course, we use sign, and then someone decides, oh, it's a good idea to get an autograph. And suddenly, what seems  you're called, who knows probably was 20? People, they're demanding your time, they're grabbing your arm. I thought it was a problem, because they were looking at, and not seeing any resistance or eventually. It was sort of a glazing excitement and unreality. This kind of helped during this. I began to wonder if maybe I missed something that wasn't so great after all. Whether I wasted a lot of time wishing I was on the show, even pretending sometimes that I was. what I want to ask you a question? All right. I want to ask you if it was true, where you ever really going to be on Zoom. Yes, I called up Karen. Sheet enough. to do it soon. She just watched, but she was one of my closest friends during that time. I've come to distressed in my own memories and wonder whether, , how much of it is wishful thinking, how much of it was, , fantasy or dreams or aspirations, and or what I told people sort of cover story. I guess I should get back to my line in the spirit of more fun, Here's exactly what my wife wants. I let people believe that I, Dan Djergen, was dating, be dating, the real dating on Zoom. What's there a kid on the show named Danny? Yes. I remember, I wanted you to be on that show so much I got to. Well, maybe that's Danny. Maybe he took a very different one to tell us. Sounds good. Sounds good. actually in the second cast. I didn't really intend to impersonate him or anything, but some of the time I would just go with it and honestly, yeah I was Danny, which technically was speaking was true and then they would get all the same. So I did get some of the time. I was, I was titled in crafts. This is my prep, and yeah I may not necessarily be the ones and I feel  knowing . I think I did ask for a doctor. But then I was very sorry to you. You could have made a fine too. Actually, I think, oh, I know what my response was. My response was, you weren't Danny, were you? That's what it was. Now, if that didn't, in the case, I don't know what I'm... It's not really true. If you'd really been Danny, I'd probably be almost , not quite well in the exactly  me. I'm not eating dhanya, I'm eating that. There's nothing up there. That's... It's just... All I think is disappointing, but , It was a nice little father from the maybe he might've actually been here. , I think everyone I talked to really wanted to make me feel better. It's okay that you want the real day. You're perfectly good day. By the way, do  the real day? See, that's the problem. Fame makes you more real. And it's funny, we protect children from other adult experiences in her this kind of power, but not from this one. We don't let them drive cars or smoke or get married, but we let some of them be famous, and the other ones you're in for. Thank you. And here's something else. WGVH is starting the whole thing up again. They're reviving Zoom. Right now, they have a new cast, new director, who's already hitting the airwaves in some markings. That one of my pants were young. They had the first interactive show for kids. I wanted to own tools, who was that. I had a thing, and this is now the brand new zoom. It's hip, it's hot, and it's for our generation. So I went back to Boston, dropped by. I wanted to see the new kids. I imagine their futures. Yes, it's their thing. What happened when you were finally told? All right, you're in. Well, I was at my friend's house and my mom called me. I went to the phone and she said, hey, Ellie, you're in Zoom and I was screaming so loud. My friend started screaming and they didn't know they were speaking about me when they came home where everybody was jumping up down the driveway. That's nice. If you thought it all about when it happens, , when I was your age and I was going through this. I gave a lot of thought to, oh my god, I'm going to be fixed. , we thought it all about what we'd  to be finished? Yes, that we often. And if I did become famous, I'd try out for tons more stuff. But I don't really care about being famous. I've been in place and it's no different for being in. any TV show, I just  it kind of spun. And I  to do this kind of stuff, but that we often, if I was famous. I'm gay, , mom. Awesome. Yeah. then, the wheel zoomed in, where finally track down the Malvaro Massachusetts, where he's working now, it's a musician. I called him up. Come on in zoom, come on in zoom, come on in zoom, come on in zoom. Zuh, how's that? That sounds great. , the great song. I have spent almost 25 years since my own involved in briefly with Zuh, being mistaken for you. Now, my name is Dehani. You've never seen me, but I have, when I was the age, we're about the same age, and I had long blonde hair down to my shoulders. and it's gone now. And we actually resemble each other a bit. Wow. So as my teen years progressed, I would meet somebody often, remember the opposite sex. And I would start to tell them the story of how I almost got on some. And they would look at me, and they would criticize me, and say, you're a Danny. I remember you're Danny. Ah, ah, ah. Probably finish. And I have to- be honest with you, I did not always correct you. , that's great, that's funny. Okay, I can test. I'll skip over this part, but basically, Danny was nice about him. Maybe a little embarrassed for me. Maybe a little flat. Tommy, he sent me a tape of the bandies in. Just in case I wanted to use it in his show. Here it is, buddy. I told Danny about my friend Angela and how she was in love with the second only DeDani Osmon. He was flattered by that. So I asked him a favor to sing Highter to give her kind of a radio autograph. If we could take 15 seconds, you would make this woman's day. She's now, , early 30s. And just to send a message out there to Andrew. I angel love this Danny from Zoom and I encourage her in my biggest fan. It's great to get an opportunity to thank you for watching Zoom being fan-minded. That means lots of me. And I do get around if you ever have an across the area. But we get to get together and say hi in person. Take care and best of luck. See how his voice sounds? He knows his real name. But he can... supervised a long paragraph  that to a complete stranger, a stranger who he assumes would want to look him up and they ever came to ten. And in fact he's probably right. He did. He was a zoomer. It's part of him. Joe the psychiatrist since. Satisfied a very important part of my life. Since having had that thing sense of the special reality, we're excited to share a deeper. to go on. Do you remember me at all? Oh sure. The, I don't remember your audition, I don't remember, although I certainly hope when I read the book I've been to chess to see you face. Ground zero of my search. Chris Sarsin, producer who rejected me. He's sitting in a studio in Boulder, Colorado, and I'm in a studio in Kentucky. I'm going to be in Boulder by such. see if this doesn't be good to a child you're not right. This was awkward. Just  Christmas. I kind of put him on the spot. Good heavens. I remember being much better than him. As I suspected, he didn't really remember who I was, but he was nice about it. It's a picture of the view. It doesn't have it always. I mean, this is me. Obviously, this moment was a lot bigger in my life. So let me tell you what I recall of what happened and how I came to not be picked for the cast, etc. And tell me if this sounds plausible. Okay. I'm blessing you already. I wish you a good picture. Well, , what can you do? This is what I recall. So I told him what I remember. He thought my memory was probably right, but he wasn't sure. But this time. I'd realize it doesn't matter much anymore. And that's incredibly liberating. Correctly, if I'm not, nobody really went on to a major showbiz for you. Well, I think it's lovely, , whether kids did. Chris told me about the other cast members. Most of them went on to lead a variety of perfectly ordinary lives. None are big stars. One seems with a symphony. Teachers, doctors, musicians. One was homeless for a while. Some reported having trouble. After that, there was a big thing on Zoom that was profoundly embarrassed that they'd be on that kid's show. One guy said that it wasn't until about two or four years ago that he was able to get out and finally admit without a shame that he was under Omniscient. So it may not have been all rosy if you'd got that. Okay, I understand that now. I really do. Chances are it wouldn't have changed my life. But still, I take it. That's special time. That attention. When all is said and done, I take my achievements. I'd rather be a zoom kill in just a kill. Wouldn't you? Now, but maybe. But it's okay. I'm still in the game. I write songs now. As a matter of fact, that's me seeing one of my original tunes in the background. And I'd  you to know that my team is available for playing. The name is Dan Getterman. Not Dan. The way he leanes the other and I have wrist and a wave. Last story then from how we made the sparkings it's the day. ... I again, the minstauri was produced by Jedi, vs Creation and F Natural element in the thickest Coming up, I childhood wise that may have saved the vibe. That's a minute. published at the International. This American life from our class is you can approach the first of the document every day life in the Eastern End states today show, true in the last days. We have directed the second of our two stories that children who live to themselves might others and who try to stop line once they get to be adults, act to, true to consequences. The idea Pricka was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis which was two years old. See after the degenerative disease. as a condition worsens your lungs filled with fluid and you have to do hours for a respiratory therapy every day to create that fluid. But retomicates a bit, we cannot clear that fluid, essentially you drown. Huge children with CF with Passy H-18, when Mary K. was little, understandably nobody told her that she would die so  which one of the doctors is on nervous months. She knows some experience. But I don't remember myself ever knowing how serious it was. was or knowing fully what it meant. And I don't think I asked questions, maybe, that I need to ask to find out. And I can only assume that maybe I didn't want to know the answers, or I just, I guess, though I just didn't want to know the answers. I was, I would guess in the area, about seven years old. Good-nosed, big stuff. That's when I first learned that CF was a deadly disease. And Mal will make it happen. I had gone off to the CF summer camp for the first time and I was real nervous about going but as soon as I got there I felt very comfortable. I was put into a cabin with maybe 12 other girls and we had a leader whose name was that. And I immediately quickly heard I was her shadow the entire week and during the camp we would have early breakfast and then afterwards we would go and dress with therapy. And... At that time I was not doing respiratory at home on a routine basis, but I noticed that some of the other children at camp needed this. They had to do this every day. And I just kind of sat back and watched. I really didn't feel  I was a participant, but I had the same reasons. Children had. And so I wasn't forced that first year to really think about why I was there. I was very excited to go back and the my first question I got there was where's that she was the one who the first year of life I held around with and followed and I just remember that she wasn't there and that they told me that she had died of sea up. I thought,  what? I have CF and nobody told me I was going to die. And I think a real pain set in me. My first thought was I got to get out of here. I got to leave right now and go home. And I remember, I just cried. I cried. I didn't tell anybody. I didn't say anybody. I'm scared. I didn't know that people could die. The people could die. I've seen it. So it was my aunt, Uncle, who came and picked me up alone with their kids and they're all saying, yeah, baby, why are you crying with the home? , I really think I believed that if we talked about the possibility that I would just saying the words would be enough to make habit. So, even if I got nervous about it, I just especially put myself back if I didn't verbalize it, I would be safe. Or even it's a safe and let my mom hear it would be even worse than this. I saw this huge a crank. She didn't talk about this, this is the best way to handle this. I know my parents were devastated by it. I know, I'm, ... some of the initial reaction was that if we just stay positive and maybe not think about it, the bad world happened. We'll just focus on today and we'll raise her  the other two children and that was her way of handling it and not taking what we're dealing with the person. But my dad and I have never talked about it. I've tried a number of occasions to have conversations with him about it. And... In my 20s, my seat began to progress and I began to get worse and I didn't see my dad very often. I had a feeling that he didn't know this is happening to him and at that point I began to have frequent hospital states and I call him and say dad I'm in the hospital for example and he said oh okay and I see mom here private therapy and he's okay so when else is new. If there's something else, when you're in the hospital. And I can remember him or even change in the subject to what are your sister brother-in-law? Freedom lies, Lig, Lig. You've been the teenage years I think. I lived in a fog  the thing about a teenager's too. You don't just don't think about the serious life. She's , you have to think about it. I think all teenagers can think of even when you have a disease you can do. and still even though you have her facts and front of you. So I just didn't think about it. I really was able to get away with that fact. I really didn't think about it. Now, you're right now. I'm treating my eyes late 18. I college the first time. I started to face up to the facts of this. And as it often happens, she was supposed to be doing this. Because she faced crisis in her life. And what started? Price is the fact that the first time in my life she was at a place where she had to think about the future. College is about the future. And everybody around Mary Kaye, a plan, purpose, was she had nothing to do. And you must be getting sicker, having caught in the kids' mom. And you started to change in other ways. The summer before I went away to 7-1, I was seeing that man as an... And our first dinner date. Whenever I had a joke. day or any time I was eating them with friends. I had to take my pants and there was ten large caps. So it wasn't anything high to table. Oftentimes most times I would go into the bathroom to take them. So it's not to make the scene. And on our first interday I remember won't be taking them out and swallowing them down knowing what he was going to ask me what I was doing and I think in some ways I was challenging him. Go ahead and ask me what this is. means and I knew this is going to be epic who's going to accept it and it would be okay. Or it was going to be  past times where no questions were asked and I got the feeling they didn't want to know anyway. So we didn't talk about it. His first reaction was what is that and what is that mean and what is the secret process? And that we must have asked with you questions. Now you remember. in my back these only interested and he was probably the first person that asked the questions and I answered them. But I think I had reached a point where I said, I'm not going to tell this doesn't exist anymore. It's it's a part of me this is who I am and I need to start talking about. When I went away to a side of my phone very close. And I think I really began to think at that point that I had met somebody who I wanted to spend all of my time. That I was now wasting precious time that I had, in a way that school that I should be spending with them. And I was getting to have a sense that I don't know how long I got. And I need to know, then I have something that I want to do, and I need to do the same to school. For something else happened during this time, this is something that maybe very minor for some people, but this was a really big deal for me, is that I can embrace it during this time. And for me, that was a big step from friend culture, because I remember thinking it was a big expense, and for me, it was the first time that I really took on an expense for myself. And I remember thinking to myself now, and my gonna die in a couple of years anyway. And this is the biggest purchase I had ever made and I thought, do I really want to get braces and then best all of this into my teeth and into my looks and how long might we even only work? And in just making that decision and decided to go home and get braces for me, it meant that I had enough confidence in future, even if it only meant the next. I have to say years. I had to sort of wait well if I live only five years will be worth the investment in my pocket. Yeah it's worth the investment. My health is starting to decline. It was starting to now become something I had to put my everyday and amazingly at that time trying to decide that he was born. just to do my mistake here, the everyday. And in order to do respiratory therapy, the object was to loosen the secretions in my lungs. And as the disease progresses, my lungs be into fill-off with fluid every day, and if I didn't fully, I couldn't breathe. And so what do you do is you just get behind me and start to pound on my back of the different lungs. And that will loosen the secretions. And then by using his hands on my back, and sort of vibration. I could then cough out of this equation. And there's nothing pretty about it. It's very discussed. And this is just something that can imagine couple of sharing or you would think if you met somebody, you would be embarrassed to involve in an misbetuer therapy. But when we finish doing misbetuer therapy, and I could breathe better, he felt better. And it is very intimate. ... , we sometimes joke about it. We were forced to spend this time together. We had had argument five minutes earlier. It had to be done in order because I needed to breathe. And so we called it our therapy, besides being rescued. We therapy our couple therapy. And it was intimate. And then it would bring us together. And we were forced to sit and do this. We got engaged when we were both 23 years old. We had been dating out four years. And this is a big, big, small, big getting engaged. And when we had a great wedding, I was terrified the whole day. I was just very nervous. This meant so much meant that I believed I was going on. and it meant that for everybody in the room, everybody's been charged. That they believe I'm in the future. And I wondered how many people behind their doubt are thinking, I'm kidding myself. I was always a person who finds kidding me, so. And I even wondered, am I kidding myself. Who am I fooling with? I think I'm really glad you're married today and have a future head. I hate words. really bad episode of reception and that was I was having increased trouble group around this time and I had just begun having episodes of premises and that is when bleeding starts in the arms and we start to just cough up blood, choke on blood and during the reception I was dancing a bunch of people dancing and we were actually playing a game of musical chairs and the men were all the chairs and getting down on one piece of the one that sits on the knee and this kind of happy with the news, the chair's gave it. , this is the game that's over. I had the rough knee cough and I started to feel my chest pain but and , it's, it's just a horror-fighting feeling and I knew what was going to happen. I went to a white gown on and I just ran into the bathroom and  started coughing up blood. And so that kind of just changed the whole thing then because that was, this was the one day that was not going to come to let me see after there it was right in my face. You can realize that it's 24. Very case helped to run the AI. I tried to get answers that I just started. So I'm going to talk to you afterwards. So really pissed too. I got another one. when he quoted the chosen final stage scenes. It was rather jolting dose of reality, Mary Kate told her mother that she hated Dr. and ever seen you Dr. Ken. This feeling didn't last. Mary Kate started to investigate more aggressive groups of staff with Dr. Finally, the age of 30.

It's time to upload a long transfer. It's the only thing you don't have much longer. It's a very gay way to 13 months. I remember Christmas time in December that I really began to think that this really really led me to the last Christmas. And I really had an awful Christmas I spent today. I spent today. I spent the day in May. imagining next Christmas and my family that haven't been there and I couldn't help them in this picture without and what would it be  and what would my family and how would they handle my death? I only had a conversation with my mother and I told her that I was afraid to die. Yeah. She said I know and she hugged me. and that was a big moment because we had never. She knew I was afraid and  this was our fear all along and we had never really verbalized it and so we were just standing in my bedroom and she was helping the kids for something  that. I just sent him to this disease just  it. I really thought I might be that but I don't know anymore. She just said, we just have to get those flowers, we just have to get those flowers. And so that's what we did. And I just, we just hope to have it hurt every time I watched the move, and I would hear an accident and I would feel, , I'm really saying what I wonder if I don't make your work. And , , you feel terrible in that way. And I remember my mom's tongue is  that and it was totally built to be after thinking that. But I spent a lot of time here. It was a very good day. It was a nice day, everyone. After 13 months, Mary Kay caught me. She said that she had never experienced before this. What it was  to be healthy. She did not even know how long magic was going to be run. Suddenly she could do purpose of her life was no longer staying alive. That's just 33 years old since her transplant she said two children, in girls. And then one of the central struggles I've provided has been burned based on true bathroom disease. She says there is time and place for long to yourself. About the age of 10 I don't think I was very honest with myself about the illness that I had. I honestly don't. I think I would have a different way at that point. I sometimes wonder what my life would have been  if I had been told earlier that I was probably going to die at the age of, , in my T-Rules, for example, which is I believe what my mother was being told at that time. I think that news itself can be crippling. And because I wasn't feeling the effects of the disease yet, I don't believe I needed to know. But I have to look back in one day. If the fact that I did so well has something to do with the ignorance now, I have a little term.
