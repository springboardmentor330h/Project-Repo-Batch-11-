The fact is there were things that wrecked me , that warned me. Planned basketball is not a form of them. Oh, I know. It's frustrating. I had to answer a lot of things. Especially when I was first training, I had to play basketball,  how lying to me to be among the people who took basketball. Every day I had to come down here. and play ball, net, ball, net, tree, , you just see going to their mind. K ball, they test ball, then they test the net, they get a tree, they go ball, net, tree, tree. And then, , and then I started getting them to pull the ball, and then I got them to push the ball into the net. And finally, that 18, they cut the ball off the ground, and hopped it in the net, and how is so full. So, go, they got it! She got all excited! about what's in the net taking us above, the net over and over again can't so excited.

Inus. We had a caterpillar, we had a tomato, ready to cook, close the earth. Second picture, crying madness, it's a caterpillar. And in the third picture, it's rancher, eat the grandparents. Cat and trauma takes us to a apartment in New York City, she has a raised established future. How to stop them, isn't it? Growing up, Cat and trauma was really an an offers. She also had a petal. Then a few years ago she was working on these sculptures, which she would take dead insens and glue it on in the paintings and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flowers, more than she could buy. She should have decided to start raising live flowers in a glass cage in the corner for her apartment. She would just let him breathe and wipe them to die. Even one day she heard that the camera, and looked at the flowers through the walls and plums. This was so much fun about I saw blankets in genitals, malls, and I saw them, and I saw them, they're alive. how they would kind of create each other and what they would do. And , I see them being born. I could see them having sex, I could see them moving, I could see them falling, I could see them hanging out. And it was great. Fasten it. So that's the flowers. Just a thousand more flowers and you can see me more. And that's when I kind of got hooked into animals. I don't know. The past of this important journey. She realized that there were two basic moments in life, and she couldn't see the fast-killing tree. She couldn't see the eating, and she couldn't see them down. So she came up with this plot, and she called them fishing. She decided to raise a few different animals, catathmas, and they had嚴 ruh when he was getting angry. And that's it, guys. pictures each animal eating a one-key room, a natural photo. When I first started to project my computer, I was stunned on me when I was kind of fishing around for coming in my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be need to be eaten is photograph, I'm specifically to be with a new concept. It's more used what i found that mensen animal works. And so Patron began to fill in a lot of rooms. There isn't much French, but every service has got to rare in its cages. Frogs and meal moms in the safe and long table, goal-fishing kitchen to feed the frogs, crickets, which are cursed, constant, to rancher, and two cages fond ones. A spare corner of the table with a frog in the safe, she's got a light box. You sit down and take a look at some of her pictures. So, this is basically... food chain. Photos don't look  normal nature for time. These are the fashion shows. The animals are bread, eat, and charcoal foods. And during the career, we're going to go back. It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes, home appliances, eat caterpillars. My original idea was for the spider, to acquire trash vegetarian foods with sine. If there were two emotions competing in the job, her fascination is a future. And her disgust is what she was doing. It becomes clear that she's just a part of that in the end, her fascination on it. She lays out a sequence of shots and begins to crank that into the bottom of the technical. That's really great. She springs on it and she wraps her arms down there. She starts biting into it. and the things live and it still kept me with the catapars since all they do is basically their body is just one long digestive system and so whatever they're eating, since she bites into it, it just fills out. So if they're eating leaves, it's when she bites into it. And this is totally surprising. She just happens. It comes out the clean or it comes out right red, color of tomatoes. Or it comes out bright yellow, and it's really not. So I did different. sequences of caterpillar with different colored guts coming out. And it was just beautiful. It was really, I didn't know that an animal eating something could be so, so attracted. It was  spilling the two of the paint out on a white piece of canvas and just blobs out. It's gruesome if you think about it in terms of a brother of sister. So manyöhensup. that it is insectivists, as attached to these. Well, it is just a different one. You think it would be easy to take pictures of the pattern of the human rights. That's what I do. But it turns out to be more complicated than just when the pattern was the same as the same one. The other consideration is exactly the same. We should try to have for our statements. The problem was the first to be found. For the one to show it. for the advantage of the trauma of your trauma. Then there's the transient problem. Translust and go for months with your feet. Days of effort. She put the spider and pregnant in the stop-up of the set. And the transient will just stay in her form. This will be still one leg. Or else. Finally, in one session, three in one. After staring through her camera all night, she puts asleep on his own. You see the shot with two of them looking each other and then basically the spider Houndstone it and slip it over and create me access is upside down looking still looking straight at And perfectly alive,  looking at you as the spider is marching on the middle part of the spot And then you see his head This is no antennas or waiting around and then It's slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws Ch participation just still alive and then the spider basically kind of mouches it up and see what that fall and straps the enthusiasm. It's not raining but three or four hours for it to equal and for at least half that the pain has to do. And it's hard because she's spent so long raising here. It's hard to see if we apply  that and have it to the salon. At this point, for pictures from the salon on this, so it's the suffering of the shoes. I'm going to test the pain, and this is the, I see in the pain that the style was definitely my childhood since that time. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves  ours that's on net. And so they turn and look at it. They've got these big eyes to know. They have some of the characteristics of the things that should be seen. So they just help their guys and kind of think especially. Yeah, their mouth is red on the inside, so they need to know. Eat something that looked  they had their lipstick on. It was much easier to touch them. One thing is the feature of this makeup. It's how the shoes, the traditional stuff, the more fun to make. The feature of the makeup is the pets.

I was in hours and I was in the middle of taking... , come back and join the ministry of the work of yours and come back and join me and see what can happen. I'm just kidding. Did you recognize that since I was 20 years old, I think it's somewhat well. I was quite, I mean, I had waited four hours and finally so I had to go and work up and running the hours, nowhere to be found. But then, one time they, she instead of instead of him getting to be lost, and we lost ourselves. She caught him and wrapped arms her room. She was holding around that button and I walked in on her room. She started eating. I've made it in two years ago now and had to do that. What is on that? Brist? There's no blood. That room eating. Oh, just open the door. Yeah, you see, he's still kind of halfway on. She reached around and grabbed him by the neck. and bit herself. See if he hasn't got there. Oh, that's one of his arms. There was kind of a fight, it's  the tip somewhere. And she's being straight down his abdomen. See he's only asked his waist, he'd ever shippin' and shippin' and shippin' and shippin' and shippin' much than some use. When you do that, you can see. Well, we insects, they're bodies more and they're not essential in their existing kinds of semen. You can cut that you, you might have head off and the whole theory is that they see their body keep functioning. So she can bite this head off from there. and he continues to have sex, continues to give her strong, which is why we have the problem. And there was some scientists to measure the inside of her cabin and she bit who's head off. He got, she bit his head off, she got more to me. So he's head actually actually as inhibited, and when that's gone, she's lost. So in the case, she's got a theme I've been had off that she had. I suppose theoretically therefore more of those things. What do you mean he said Axie? But he's very passionate about his passion since the original news had. So at this point he's definitely still not. She's not. Put that nervous and all you have is that... But Sammy accused, you're too cool. last year. There are about one nice thing. Some just want this.

Yeah, I mean at one point you feel really bad about thinking at one point you really have to be seeing a game. If it's something to listen to. So you size into  this, your size always changed. And when you put thinking up there, you put the snake up there and then you feel really bad. And you're , , it's not that good. and with the switching part of it, there was the points that knew you take the side of the set. The end of the dark and the end of the dark is the pattern, you have to change the size can, you do this again. And this pie which I've noticed in the end is, so you just kind of get off and you can explain. It's getting to the point of the last project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, pumpkin can't be anything. But she's grown. Eventually she'll be three feet before long she'll be followed up next. The ones that Catherine feeds in her own business. It's one thing to feed, that's in the broad feed for something, something where the feeding has no sense in it yet. We'll know, we can't see, we can't smell, we can't see. And it's not when , people will grow now, who is... where I'm quite strong on and it seems to me. And I don't know why we did when she starts eating something. Right now it's still something you can do. Something you do. I don't know. Is there a line? Which starts being hard to do? Nothing talks about her. I think it makes sense. She loves eating home food, coffee, and coffee. You do a place that's wrong. It's going to be nice. But in another way it's not happening.

Coming up, Animal Radio Theater by David Sedaris, Animal Research was got carriers. It's the mouth of the mind. This American guy, America Glass, he proposed a course to his topic, and he called that topic, which is short-fiction, radio monologues, bounce, hate, eating, making click up, in three this topic. animals and the animals as far as possible. We have arrived there. Two of our program is a space where it's more animals than other animals. But first things, a little girl is given in a sweater, ugly new sweater, which she hates. She takes the sweater, puts in the floor, takes the hat and she wakes up the sweater from two to two. She wakes up up here. But her mother's very upset. I didn't do nothing. I'm just not the sword. I'll see you in hell first. I'm in a lot of cards. Today we're gonna play for our program. This play is... an original radio play, entirely blind couples. In this play, the animals do lots of things humans, for example, they talk. And they go court out of the cars. But in this play, also, every known, unlike most fairy tales, as leads to better stories than others. These animals research their animals. Or play begins. This path means to start with hits up to the bottom. There's an area where you go up close to the bottom. I want you to roll around and down. It's dark. You have to see the floor on the screen and I read a mark. It is carefully my spamming meaning what and what all you have to do. And it's the only thing you need to do. I think it's the only thing you can do. I have to go down to the bottom. This word is in session. She's silent. She's perhaps a search for lives. Who pans chess with the patent sized balls, the poundings gather and make them along. We know witness leading those swearing or shedding, though tampering can cause regret and shredding. All on the state now to start prosecution. That's what then counter to prove that solution. The clearance signed and kept at the floor. The scene talking turned behind all the desires. Your other, descriptions no small, this theater, the accused here is vicious, we should part here. Now I plan to prove the undereased stuff. Kathleen, the Spaniel engage, about census destruction. It's got no remorse. The fact that I'm a movie, of course, I called this, and one eyewitness worm remains firm. It seems  a lifetime, the warmth of life, takes you to the stand, it can get her and ever. Yes, I'm worm true! I live in the zoo! Only in rainwater it will turn for you. I understand question me out of his shell! So using my well-known Evdovino power, I lifted myself from the ocean mud ground. I clowed and I climbed eventually found myself! I don't win the world! Just a word. Up that I would  to tell Richie Smith. Right, I said his focus. I know what I'm saying. Did I finish up the disbanding of Anthony? He changed the stuff she gets this way. She uses a song of a hyper-type web. She now old and fan with a tongue into color. And no one know where I could stop her or stall. I asked her on you with his half-watching this stust. I think it's a poor, not funny. And just eight dogs know, I think she should have now We better be to learn a match as the chest in a squirrel. You are my baby, not think you are a boy! She's  a boy, right? She's an extra set, and reached on a humble old cousin. You are a little bit. The cat said, I watched as a ring, Hoped in the call of the cat, and said, I said, I mean, you are under it's clear that this war is deceptive. I'm wondering now if she might be receptive to proving her eyesight so that she claims I'd  her to read from the shortest moves. The best of luck with me, loving me, and carried it out past the pond to the trees. Can you read this name here? It's first on the list. That's too far away. And one is. I can't read that far, but even in date, you might as well post it in a row, but I pay. So your sight. Sip bird. Peanut, proving point. Is something you boast upon when you annoyed this court with your presence? The old seeing worm. Your sight is on par with an old pack of dern. You're a small and deceitful. You crawl to no ledge. You witness no crime  the one you alleged. Stop talking to me and you're also legally. I don't know what I saw. I can't read level. I mean, steal the last song! I've seen lots of things! I've known as you! Oh, she and take off on your ways! I know all about you! I would as my honor! She looked at the burden, a certified gunner. The rims were softly as if to confirm, and then she launched bald, beheading for porn. Objection. She kept me out. She's eating my witness. Well, on show, boys, stop this witness. Thanks to warm, in turn to a bunch, but long as tell branch of a young soul from birth. The cat called him as a chubby black monkey. I'd say one suit twice in my room, but he'd think to move his place this thing in paper, it's by the small, she's the son's. I'm a cookie that I am into air with you! Congratulations! You rise from your beds and meet in this clearing. Practice your chest. It's all for our fatigue. Ooh, your sister's disgusted. It's rotten and steak. And if you think I'll raise my rat hand on my piggy and honor to you then you are quite mistaken. I'm so sorry. But no statement out may be this. I will see it where to your promised prediction. They made out based on species, Chad, rather new down on the ground, and he faces his feet. Then, cow-tow to you, would you adjust to such a thing? I'm no friend of yours, do you hear me out of labor? Oh, shit! What's this? The court has some chaos. The critic popped off. She flew in the air, which is  barries in the car. The critic, she followed me to the city. And he turned, having eaten that hot thing in the critic. I will see you in the next video. Now cry of the alpany, the judge and the lawyers date the silent okay? Ex-Witness! Just fucked! Well, me to mention, we're holding this court with the soul good intention of seeking the truth of narrative justice. It helps me call a witness with trustless. You're honored? Yes. I know, called a squirrel, a trustworthy witness, a very nice squirrel, hardworking and thrifty she lives in that elf. I'm hoping my colleagues will not overwhelm or badge them. I witness she's to be sure I'm just a policeman and shatter her. Why don't you bring on this witness? Enough of your chatter. Let's hope that this squirrel can finish the matter. Tired. Long gristle. Please, let's proceed. We can't look at the watch of this problem. Indeed, you're stalling this part with your war bringer, Rabbi. I'm thinking if your honor defense is just gambling. Playing for time is a transparent tactic, some collector. I call it die-dactic. You run for time. give me. I call your attention to my leading witness that squirrel I mentioned. There was no need to point, no need to cause the squirrel is talking. She said her purpose and crossing her legs leading up the evolution. The squirrel I'm speaking to me. I said I did the whole thing to me. I was sitting there and I'm leaving the nuts in my teeth. I gather them atrás, I take everything and this guy that's all the way up his head and eye are back. Sometimes our hearts are about to dig the grave for some later time when we have a cold. It's easy digging through diggives and snow. Jack. Jack. I think we all know that winter is frosty. It's chilly and tough. In terms of our hardship, we've all heard enough. Get out of your story, another year. Yes, there. Hey. What's the best of it to us? I was searching through food then without on my grounds. My sister remarked that I gained a few pounds in my hips and my shoulder. I'm going to keep fighting. Let's smash it. I respect her being in and so I'm with me, because I'm something I saw. It was in multicore and all of the pouring so I found. But it seemed the infernal nut get in question to turn that to be gold. It was chewed and I wound. Yes, the size of the cramp. Oh, without a mind mind, man, I wanted it as name. The Jackson year-order is getting off cramp. Hot glue, cry. Let's get on. It's crying. You're honored for birth. My witness needs time to set a person of emotional stress. So... and it's also for some months of rest. So anyway, if my name reads there, exactly 133, for some time for an error, when I heard an event sound to my voice, it sounds quite angry. So I need to choice ID, as we know and set on my pages, and then I begin for re-wild, dungeon check. It happens sometimes they have a brief spell that you think is very certain, but something can help my brain for nothing. Doesn't need a black gel. What is this? I'm sorry. You are lying so frail. I'm wondering if there's a story and tells the fact that these things Is there any connection between the accused and your brain in protection? Technically you! My body was there but my mind is dreaming. I was there seeing that I know for a day. I was hoping for it. I've been waiting for you to make me feel  I've been waiting for something I needed to mention to everyone that is having an ending. I've been exciting to make editing spend and also it's me perfect because in a sense I enjoy public speaking. I love seeing this ending. I've heard that across the pebbles and in range. You said you had seen things that you were complires and had information concerning my clients. I might have been old and I can see. I know what to do. But now I am reverting it with microphone on. Hello, do you mind you dying to eat? Kka! I'm very slip of sound. Keep up the mean. As come to discuss, you are witnessed, shisa. Some tasks that we use the Mish Grenmets. How dare all your body come to the battlefield! Hello, have me blue eyed eyed eyed eyes, and a man he comes to color all him. It means come. I feel I'm being shrewd. I don't  the way my colleagues treat illegal profession, especially me. I'm so soon to become a full flash amp you see. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I'm so good at stuff. I'm getting the beat. I just want you to ask me if now you want to speak. The cat in my chambers of brief niche. guilty. But if I ever hear so much as a granular of trouble from you, then I'll put you away. Thank you, you're out! I heard that Lisa. Go on now get out of here, hurry along. Get back to your home, back to where you belong. I'm waiting for Kathleen the soft-small creek. She passed me just fine. You can just speak. And I would turn to my comfortable bed. Give it a – pal.  something.

But nobody knows why these pre-human started walking around in two layers. It's the walking around, of course, with mustard. We didn't hear it, but nothing senses. It's ten years ago, Scott Perry had set up this music. And he made this really. Well, let's go get a seat. to the right. I've played ways to wake up. We have been a couple of years ago, I read and I went to my home to run down Nathal. So, whatever I got hit on me, it was August. My friend was to chase one out until it overheated and collapsed. It was just a couple of years ago. You were a couple? Very good reasons for what we will do. One was that it seemed entirely possible. Another had to do with value because we couldn't remember the solution. It's a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain. We remember the scene in 2008, we realized it's a good thing. And we're just in a very good mood. Then he throws the bone in here, which means the space there should work in the earth. The theory behind this scene is that we separated the caves, we stood up right, and feed our hands to make the news tools. Especially we weaponed tools, and we can't remember. It's called hunting offices. There's nothing wrong with it, except that we don't have to visit rather than support. It is that tools and weapons that we don't own. While some of the workings better than us as myologist made him interested in other theory of evolution, he might call it run-offices. He believed he and I probably didn't have answers to be able to run down big game. That used to be what he was all. And he thought that if we could do, then maybe a brilliant sister stood up too. Surely before we went to our home, I need to see him on love show. The key to that part. you can't stay in the worst. We talked about the ranking of offices. We thought it was pretty fun. I mean, I just think about it. What game are they going to run down? Things  will the beast or something? And they're just going to start off running. We got to split. We're going there and they just start running after a wilderness. I need that snack here. The weak length that all the haters that you're described is the inability to be able to run in fast. Because it's so damn slow. So damn slow because it's a clumsy vibe. Zunnel adapted to hunting, slow, awkward little, no ol' fash. No protective vision, if it were effective quadrupedic to do everything you're describing. I mean imagine a bunch of pyrid-op Indians that could run as rapidly and as successful as you've done in chapter 2. They catch the thing into the human three minutes in the dollar. Well I decided to have a genie shepherd and I taken with me and go running. And love Jo is right, he's a better runner-trying, in fact most of the time he'd rather haven't taken bicycle. So there's no question about me being slower, but as far as being clumsy, love Jo calls to be the reason for me to be the reason for me to be the reason for me to be the biomechanics. Running by P28 to ask twice as much, which I'm not even quite a P-D. That is, in my garden I run. He used this half the energy that I used. So love you, and me and I other than that, all of this, he could praise you to assume that this rival strategy herely hominins involved run half quadruped. They've just got as big, both in terms of speed and efficiency. But the thing is, if my dog and I go run in the summer, in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it's a whole different quality. So come with me and I run for a while, with any walk. and sometimes it just goes home. So if I'm an awkward clumsy wife, why can I outrun by nox? Well, it's because he overheats. The main way that he, the most other quadruped, that's cool themselves when they run, is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of the mouth evaporates water after tons. When we do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating. And then we get a nice flow of air directly over. skin because we don't have a fur coat. So we can't run as fast as a quieter ball but we can run farther, especially in high heat. And when we remember that we're using twice the energy, this seems  a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox combined with the argument that not being able to hunt that tools. It made my brother and I decide it's time to try it on down. Now we're... And to look at the American, the foreign war, the second fastest land man, one foreign. He started to be keep one running for two hours on the hot day. He had to be. He was getting me a chance. And they were a foul. for about 30 minutes to the problem, I wasn't sure if I was following the same one that's the other one because I said I'd following four bucks to those in England. I mean, they ran into, that's about two and they ran into a group that got five more and over a hill in then on, I was so really broken through groups of these. So I think I'm the point the same. I couldn't be sure. And I followed him for another 15 minutes. And then they ran into a much larger group ran for ways. And followed that larger group for a while. And then that group broke into at least two more groups. And at that point, he started to gave up. But I didn't know which visual I was chasing. Well, then I got to see some of the roads. Where's the road we run? Down here? Okay, what happened with I came out Where were you? You I got lost. I I I was really Where I was. I felt  that road. I walked on the road. I went there. I'm on direction. So we started with him. They ran a circle , because we were not I don't remember crossing this road but must This was yeah They ran in a circle. They came back. Well, strike one. What do you, what do you think? Planes, they're just one. Not, not because you're in the middle. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It could have been the Seren Gettling, Orange and Green and Purple Plains, a hot sun, thin high clouds, blue mountains are horizon. I think it's a little... It could have been the Seren Gettling, but we were no crumpled partners. It could be realised that nothing is bad. when you're chasing for the land we were running from. We ran after several herds that first day, without my success. That night, sleeping out, and then the feeling very high, in terms of elevation,  being dizzy. When any clouds reach us, it's just seemed  too much open space. Satellites in order, illuminate. and we're going to wish you a good day in the last few months themselves. That's all right. The next morning, we had a breakfast of chocolate chip cookies and we used to use and walked around waiting for the air to heat up. Ready retarder? get animals, bear bones, and abandoned house. They come into it here. You saw dust levels, burnt oats, and ego? Of course, huh? You found a small lake, some badlands, from the battlefield. It's never did get very hot that day, but we have to move. We have a good long chase after two minutes and two minutes. They ran in circles around the mirror with that tin square on. There are two deals. long-smooth balcony between the chase and up and around. And back and forth between these hills, the envelope running short periods of time, covering long distances, and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the team as if they were trying to protect us. In some facts, they all go in different directions, but we stay behind the team if the males are eventually enjoying. One thing we're doing is a bit short. is that we could run much less distance than the animals. I stayed well inside the circle. We also started communicating with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills, and he could see where the animal could go and keep going. And I wouldn't have to run into the top of the hill. So we were running after these three, and being pretty good, but not letting him ditch us. And a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of... And I'd look into their eyes, trying to see some signs of fear with the tree. But all I kept seeing were very quiet animals that seem to know exactly who we were, what we were proposing, and didn't seem to be at least bit worried. Anyway, we ran after these three for about half, and then they found the large herd for the herd found them. And they ran up an over-compiled. And by the time we got to the top of the field, the herd exploded into three groups, who got three for animals each. In each of the groups seem to have at least one female with exactly  the one in the study chasing, the magic shell game trick again. We're really all that physically tired, mainly mentally beaten. We were poor. I haven't gone back to Wyoming for the purpose of chasing Hamilton, but drive through gaseouss and gaseouss I was moving east and there was a train along the highway, also going east and about the same speed. And suddenly there were three elements learning along side the engine chasing it. It was incredible. It was even more incredible. It was a few of the same things in speed up, pull out in front of the engine and fly across tracks. I pulled over and waited to the train to go back. and then they were three young men who were backing me for the same glad eyes and how they bleeding off. In the old since he first recorded that story, Scott has put it into the collection of stories, but, typically, running after Antwerp. Now I'm the king of the swingers who hold the tongue so we are beat. Have wished that top and head to stop and end. That's what's bothering me. I want to be a man, man, cub. I'm strong right into the challenge. And be just  the other men. I'm tired of them all in a round. Oh, a little bit too. Do we want to be  you?
