Finally, one person. It's left standing. That person. It's up. How tough could this be? Under the contest rules, you get a five minute break every hour and a 15 minute break every six hours. And to the contest, it's at first. It sounds  easy, something's enough. I think it's going to be easy. Because it's all in the mind, I have so many friends that are going to come same here.

Especially one guy, any performance. any lighting audition for video studies? and it would turn to try and win again. Then he says in fact, it's not his life. No, it all starts. Okay, on the first day, you read your, this is  an old work, and you go through the day being extremely bold. You're listening to the radio, there's people going around, and walking around coming out. And that takes away from some of the board that you stand in your spot. doing absolutely net. And so your mind is looking for input in something. And everybody pretty well, yeah, it's right. And we get to know each other. The thing is, this kind of situation lasts for three days and months. Three days and months. Three days and months. It's time for you. It's time for you. What happens is you go slow. I mean the man has got to raise the body. You can work for a while. You can say, wait, what's your mind? It's got to raise. You have to have sleep. And when you deprive your brain, rest, then you start going slow, and close. It's an awesome kind of feeling. It's something that, , if you have an... It's very steep. Try some fast train in one spot. You feel  you've transformed from paying for places. You see things in our day. First there was one time when I thought I was at a piano bar. In the back of the truck, back of the camp, was actually in my mind, back of the piano. And someone was waiting, I couldn't see. I couldn't raise it hand, see you. and I remember standing there looking for Ram and saying, okay, I'm in a piano bar. And somebody's playing here, where's my room? Somebody forgot to write a song. And that half of the thing goes, comes and goes, comes and comes. And gets drunk and sleeps and you just get new. My son was there and he and another young man drove a baseball. And as the baseball would ought to be there, you can actually trace it. I can see a thousand baseball who crossed first. Mhm, well, one isn't it? So you, it was brief, but I stopped. Now, there, the second day, my feet hurt. They got hurt for debate, and I can claim that. Then, I'll love the real past. For the servo world past, I'm not hungry anymore. I was , I'm gonna keep it with me. I did this. I'm gonna keep it with me. , I'm gonna keep it with me. And then I got flanking the back of it. , while I was there, I ran it through my mind. I'm gonna keep it with me. I don't know what's going on. And so then I started working with Peter. And so then I started working with Peter. I'm gonna keep it with me. And keep it with me. So this is what it was, the blood was supposed. And I got an ocean everybody's name, but from course I was staying in your short I had on the padded pair of leggings I had. And the ones show one half of this morning that extra support. From your collective worst pole hose in your body, the cow and the sea. And the ones show one half of this morning that extra support.

That's what I said back then, said both. , if you're not heart-eating enough, then you wash off, you will. But when you go, then , the whole thing will let you sleep, but that's the kind of fact you have to. There was one gentleman that I think there was three columns left. And from the views came up. to the chain, asking what he wants to eat, and he can't ran and says, I don't have. And he literally did not look what he wants to eat. And I realized it. And I said, I said, listen back. Don't know what you want to eat. I said, I know exactly what I want to eat. What I'm going to eat when we come out from this net, right? I said, you understand, you don't know. I said, you really made it. and use her severe needs. I said I would record the 여기 of a change interpret while I only record her. And then early go of my turn and bring him some ink and brush gay vignettes with the cold in my city He's been in the next position. I said, I said, I said, I'll stay in here, take me down. And it's with me. The only way that I can be be for time and sorry is if there was someone that had is if there was someone that had just got as many help that person could possibly say what happened to him. it's a contest they say of Stem, but it's the same pain they're saying who loves... and whatsoever kind of down Scottish. Everybody starts feeling sick and there was said drop-up. I don't know if I feel the sun came back. The sun came up. It was long time. There was a heat long time. I think there was bad idea of Schme.

And somebody drops off and you get a slight awesome silver rush. And you feel  you can jump at me. I mean, this, this, it comes up on coming in. You feed it all over and you just get changed.

Lots, and you need to. It's... You will cry, but maybe same time. You prove that. You... Or it gets down, or the last thing, that's when it gets ruined. You feel sad for the year, or the last thing, that's when it gets ruined. about most of these trains and family there, most of your trains and then you've got things, people that by this time they pick that who they want to meet and everybody who's for some time, , and we can look over here into the trains and family and playing stuff , so the person who they're looking at she's not okay, , , call it if you're looking better than this other person, they're in. and you can see it and it deals with the works. And you don't , you don't , , we say, hey, me and I deserve it. And then you get thinking about, where I, , all these people have been and don't they realize that we're safe? We're hurt and you feel  they're kind of blurtest, you're right. I mean they're there to see this spectacle and it seems so it's very, very sad. Very sad. At the time. There was a gentleman that was standing to not right. He... I need to enter the degree of and I have told him that already our Cypher welfare brings some questions, the true truth of the Lord. Underdog. Our Committee has said the presentation and the entire universe within all kinds of We are going to see you later on, That is where רקan He just threw him over. He said, he's rubbing his hands  this. Look at him. And it was his hands and maybe I selected them. Truck, his hands, dizzy, blocked him. What's going on? You're supposed to stand here with you to be. He better stay there. , he can't snap at it. Because he was losing his mind. I mean, his eyelashes are on his hands. And all thesedraws are already just blinded. in life. And he's a little white in faming, staying in over there, he's nice all over what I've done, and I've done it. But even off on the next break we all put off, said another spot. And when I came back to Turkey, he did the backer. You experience a great camaraderie with these people because they have been through these things being done. They know it's life. It's, , it's life. The guys come back and he's face for a reason. The rest of... They've got a camaraderie that they share. It's a closeness. Nobody. understand because the human needs. If I want this trip myself stay in my set war, we're temporary. There's times I feel that I can control. I feel as though a time travel is extremely safe. I've had a lovely day. I remember sitting in my front, I'm sitting in the right front of my lo, and I'm not sitting there looking. And I'm just being, you two three are sitting there looking. In total, if you , yeah, it's... I really did. I really worked. I really went through this. I mean, I'll be able to really follow and do back on that as well. , if I have to plant, plant, plant, and do the engine in the hour, I mean, till it just follows, I'll be walking right out of the wall. That's when I say that, and I'm gonna say that, but I have to come. I mean, I'm not gonna go coward after an hour and y'all. This dessert. later on I searched the small fights together here where now by your side the world's act force that might be made for good. Good night, good night, good night, good night. Any hurtens were seen with young hands and hard bodies, which shows many people must stand and do the soothing. Which were the most important. And in the air since we've reached Brightcast, the story comes to mind on what we do. There's no contrast in building 2005. I'm gonna move on upwards, we have to give up on youringers. I have to speed on it, I have it all right. I'll see you up up in some... making run by volunteering for medical experiments. You could make a study that could do up for 10 days or so. With 8 or 8 or 10 other guinea pigs, the feed you that read is for you. You can read it right all day. The first thing to do is rock. What? Typical pay for a good study  this $200 a day. $200 a day. Up Helms the Zenebap is called the zero rates, various medical facilities, best food, care, to the best mind in honest with you. He says that there is basically community people who do this. You're not going to get rich. You could do it for a living if you're dispenses very low. And you can do it for a living if you have another income for some people who are actually book them very close together so that they're doing them more often than they are. It's... a little bit disgusting to it when you cross the line into disgusting. Disgusting is when you do something very painful, getting very little money. spinal tap studs, trained people have spinal nerves. There are some pain, hundred dollars to pick, fix, final term. Training, train, fluid out of spinal cord. and sometimes you walk away and have paralyzed. It's leaking. Things  this, this disgusting. And I just don't want to. I never go near it. The worst, the most painful, and uncomfortable one of them done is actually behavior of my stomach while a radioactedly traced exam which was disintegrating and taking photographs of them. I was stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, and I had a tube down my nose into my test and catheter in my arm at the late very, very, very still for about eight hours. So that was very uncomfortable deal. How much it hit 200 dollars each time? It needs three turns. Please accept other people, higher and worse. Well, I sometimes think of it. in comparison to say an art model need model models for art classes or artists in a limited way. It's similar. You're also prepared to a sex trade work either across the food or in a lot of dance. Let's get to the hierarchy of people who sell their bodies. I'm not sure if he would be a professional athlete. But of course that takes very intense concentration It's different in a lot of ways, it's different in a million So when you wait down the scale, okay, so the next one definitely will be It would be a very highly paid fashion model Then down there, down below would probably be The bottom would be probably a process of doing very dangerous and extremely unpleasant work Where, how much can it take you probably to be somewhere on the lower half, not in the middle of the upper half. But you think sort of Google fashion model, but it goes, well, past two, above, new dancer, below, new dance. Well, hey, why is it probably below new dance? It's probably well below new dance, but as far as the aggravation and the unpleasant interaction people that on the need to go. through probably, but any technique less stressful and less less of a weird pain than you asked it to. How would you to bear this to say at a time working for your own weight, down on the job, or essentially, correct or stuff that? It's much, much, much better. Explain how. Fast-food restaurant job you are committed to eight hours. every day, whatever you're going to say. Say eight hours every day so that every day is, Scott is gigantic, holding it. Just can't do anything else. You're all that time you're working hard and you're getting very low, very very low. That's not really enough for a day. Person should be more than that for a day's work. Do you miss Travis Ezee-man? Yes. Ideally, that's all it is. Say, De-man. But there's a danger in thinking about it that way too much because one should always understand that there is always risk very very small maybe really great let's take and I think one of the one of the particular strong risks in doing psychiatric drugs and I'm not really going to be scared you do not do studies with the psychoactive so she copies me that I get it in your word phrase, the phrase brain sluts. It's more harsh than most community views, but it's disgusting because they're becoming retarded from money. I'm just very sensitive about, I personally don't play it out for rent. Is your main experience of doing this just that it's boring, obviously. It... can get really boring sometimes if it's very long study you start to feel  a cage animal it gets very aggravating start to feel  a princess thing but what? yep sure off under my stroke and you want yep people describe   really bad job think they say it's my boss is just  he's just on me all the time he's just watching me all the time a cage and I'm out of my business and  that's the primeest of the start. Yep, that's it, exactly. And yet somehow you thought it was a freedom of your... Yes, when everything's going well. So to create random stories, that's not something that's not something that's not going to be zero and it's not for a third testing. The answer is the question of stories from the scene part, the genetic scenario and then talks if you want, you need to research subjects.

But one thing that's interesting about this is that one character quiet. of him doing it is that he ends up better than a target. In fact, he's , one of us. That was an old age.

Screw all it into the vapor and foundation. We'd hype and have the sears, blind us to catch rainbow trout and go sled and have snow buffens.

Nothing about the eggs have changed, but in 30 seconds the jar had been transformed from top-notch product in the better soil.

We thought he should listen to three words, but those eggs were in the eye. More trash and less work. Less work and more time, find more line. Funty. But we do whatever we want. No work. Just in, sledding, snowballs, food stains. No. Wantahs saved in excuses. Listen good lines. and check us out on the scene. Her father had raised ten children and never once resolved to come in the wrong from her scavenging. She was missing one, so Dad spoke slowly. I don't want to waste any more than this. And all... to come sludger herself. I won't do it. And three weeks we'll be from them. Dad had heard that men can most split footage of terrifying sloping communities.

The stop we captured to the halfway down ground for the one collapsing, you wouldn't call me even captain to the stars. Our house was in A-free and Captain by Wild Christmas. I'm very daily moved in, fish hatching and trucking back down and driving to stop and back. Talking about good moments. There was no time to locate fishing rounds, who split steam and set him to a local in-dad sheared from the bank. My first fish ever was 12 inches long and that was the whole bit.

She said trash was a horrible thing, but it was difficult for us to believe that this was a big break and non-quicken solution from that moment? Now I'm clearly a figure of importance.

She ran a top speed and took a lot of great things, fleeing the arms, and squeezing a huge circle back into this red paper on the ground. And this means so sick, then old and couldn't drive home, and weighed around the house and found. Mom put two into it together and used to age the protest. She didn't sleep again, and she didn't show you guys from... She didn't do a single tour. For a week, the sorrow was twice a day. Straight to a room after work, and stopping out to the car. Dad compared all trash meals, the sourdough quotes from the dried new messenger above the stove. Dad mixed it in the second hand flower, and among the stacks of angels, Richard to his parents, smithed with coconut syrup, lime, and all from the stove. Who wants the golden seal, shall we? Me, me, me. Well, I'll talk to you. She gave us a daughter to spend the games of her son with her age, which she couldn't sing in the second. But she would come business in the same way. She would come to the state, whatever you want, for something else. We beg of the same. We've got our knees and gradually we're missing the light in the corners of the corner. We're missing the pan, I saw it in the middle. But when she packed it again for those, we'd care the Christ of the people. on to self-esteem. Being a calling long ask about these things, she's a little perturbed on the questions. Why do I take such an interesting thing? When he's always been such a selfish chair, she was the one. She was there first. She paid the bills and kept here on. She called on it. house and unfolds and pipes and dad wants to do in winter vacation and bath. She worked really hard for Christmas and new clothes for school. Dad don't even tell me why. But he always got to credit and he's a great pop. And everyone writing on book about him, why? What did he do to deserve all this attention? She says, he has less freedom than you never know. He can't go where he wants, this can't spend anything to get where he wants. He has to go worse these are not feasible fun though, G seems fun. and came to us along that we came to meet her and spoke about her husband's heart and body. Now with me she says I'm a car piece of it and everyone happens. Birds wave is the car going on in the heart. Is that the party morning? I said, but bird, that's the best part. We should only take your share with this part. You said no, I take what I want. She wanted to be with me this song. Then she grabbed my mom. I threw it and hit him right on my head when you found the steps. As with most of them they might put down soon and just kept them from just one to a wall that he's weirding soon and long to change, but it got worse instead of that. When the person I married and personally divorced one year later, I couldn't recognize him. Later I asked him to add to him. I wanted him to see his things that seemed You got this really great part. I wanted to experience the heart of life. I didn't say the heart of the water. You did yourself that. You did yourself, you did your self, you did what happens. And that's what makes life worthwhile. What she's saying. When I ate the heart, she was upset. She ran after me. And she threw it. I ran down the stairs. She threw it after me. But I got another one. And I said, no, I want you. She wouldn't do it. I said, this is for you. You need to. the heart. I cut down and gave it to her. She couldn't eat it. She said I can't. I can't cut. She didn't think she deserved. So what did you do then? I don't know. I'm afraid it's a big lie. I'm leaving her heart. Years ago, that is here and now, I'm really jubbed with Orange juice from the sister of Sparta with Grace. staring in the voice of the bar in the mouth. For expression in the dead, she cut her finger or smashed her pro. She dacked behind the dumpster and his pain no longer. Eventually confessing her mom, she didn't crush on the woman. When he ridiculed her, Mrs. The sucker punched in his throat and his asleeped and fed for a few minutes. She refused to leave her room. So mom carried the favorite things in the plot. The ad wanted to talk and throw it. It took me long to throw up. She suggested. she's in shame's accounts, and not just a few longer. It was replacing motion by fingers and we used it when we couldn't distinguish exactly how we felt. Dad drove into genetics, but we simply attached on the stigma of the imagined and find their feelings while we were. So we finally shut them. We tried to improvise and stay in it. The squad in terms of getting to achieve the person who needs to slide to see him. No girlfriend, present, John women. We tried to hear him. So he sat down and didn't insist on driving the other side of the street. And for Hart hurt, he that's all mad. She should go from this. He was a shame she wanted. She didn't help sitting in this wall honestly. So the only way that we'd heard out was to let him sit and take it to the limit. She said no one in the commission. The only way that we'd heard out was to let him sit and take it to the limit. I remember. and how when you're young, this and you try your day of finding this. You'll never see the one who wants you. Well, you said the things you want me to find, you're not afraid of that one. To me, you love this getting in time and tension. That's a real gift. Minds me. Just keep. No, okay. It's not a crime. Minds of things. Minds of things. It's another adventure. So you go on the money, which how far can you go. And then you go on the money. do with a lot of money. But then one would be really happy to still get a do something fun. Is a certain search, everybody's curious and welcome to see people looking everyone. What are they looking? I can be right and fun, right and there. I think it's so. What do you think? Oops. I have fun.

So, computers, investors, digital síms, social media, business and software you payed better. Very asian on that knee. I'm at a serious problem. Awesome. Do I believe in the magic of Disney? Yes, I do. One day my friend Roger Cox was a 40-something unknown Lloyd actor director of the city. The next, he blossomed into a veritable industry, Pony Vogel, supporting captain, Brand new assygtuper, Eve Talks. Sound miraculous, Cinderella asks, Lady's, it is an ecstall new captain. Let's do it. We won't do this equal operation. The story begins in a little ramshackle-buckle of Sol's air conditioning, past dinner. The year is 1985. Our hero is just stepped off the plane for a new fort. Panelists, only a double bag. LA is a place where appearances are locked. Let's just say that in Fall 1985. Roger does not, but first we'll soon be playing tennis and so on. Is 41 going on 70, battered 5 foot 3, a root beard work is a self-discision. Change, smoke, a glousy dresser, has bad. Equity, wave or theater can be a cruel mistress and after 35 should inflict a certain darkness of spirit. If she takes all your money and after a while won't even w*** you anymore as my friend else says, because 35 is an age when even the most die heart-blowing and begins to m***. for life's little luxuries, once own some consciously-bound liability car insurance debtor. Roger has none of these things, so add to the appearance of some what negative life output. This is all so to change. How is almost all so Christian Anderson F. Fast forward to 1987. Roger's tapped.

Meanwhile, someone loses $6,000, there are no reviews, a friend to preference to videotape it at some tiny college in Toronto where hospitals do cameraman come to town. Final insult, Monday morning, Roger, director, the source to drive all the offices for your bike guitar. There are heros of son of lazy Monday morning and how cool those L.A. Monday morning is on at a stop-flight, Western and Santa Monica, and he's uninsured 79 bodies. Then something makes Roger root his left. And there, just triethy, and sadly, so well-fumed woman-to-peak-colored Audi. Roger, she calls out. He rolls out his window. John is in town. He wants you to call him. So number is rolled into... the shuddering Honda, followed by the screech of howdy tires. One week later, Phil, Roger is hired by this, and why not? Disney's amusement park division is expanding, expanding, expanding. They're building up Disney World or land or  Craig next is Eurovision. Then there's Japan. They need creative thinkers. Roger is... 7-year-old, 60,000 dollars in here. Perhaps four times PC-40. Job description. Imagine here. Roger thinks up rides for amusement parks. I would tell other bohoes.

Once on the Disney launch where you need a better class with people anyway, he had almost immediately met a fine new woman named Donna made it girl mission to get the tweets, catalogs, and buy Roger everything out of it. Soon Roger is resplendent as far he can at ease, phased on his endless white shirts. He trades in the civic court trooper. The Harris Purm to teach our captain new buss are purchased. Roger begins to look positively. The equity waiver needs to call industry scouts, break division, the IJF, stood for court Jewish suits. Now is one. Let's smoke. There's also twenty hiders in debt.
