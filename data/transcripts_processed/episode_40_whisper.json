Hold on my hand. Handwritten sign. There was photocopy that paced it up around the sim. In Big Brothers at the top it says, play guitar for five. dollars. They're two underlines and you need that. Then in small letters and me says, I don't give you tarvots. I keep one less. In that lesson, I would teach you three chords for five thoughts. Obviously those mindless junkies up on stage, hanging out that free out of lesson four, waving their hair around, getting free drinks and other favors, and whether better than you, because they know three chords and you don't. So, Resurculations span before dawn and watching that crappy band. I'll teach you all you need to know. You're sick of talking. I want to start rocking. Give me a call, give me a five, and I'll show you how. And then I'll underneath the guys name,  the Dean. Hong Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp, and the phone number. And the important words, travel. Call it noon, only. And the line only. By bringing up here, by the way, this is a from the BVZ struggle, this is this meant by the glass. I bring it up here because this is the dream, this right here, this sums it up. The dream of what we want, let's start taking classes. A dream is going to be easy, it's going to be quick, it's going to be cheap, and that we're going to be transformed by someone who is completely confident of that he's just going to give it to us and then it's just going to happen. and then we're going to be done. This is the dream that we carry with us into any kind of lessons of any sort, guitar, dancing, tennis, meditation, pottery, screen play writing. Well, we are back here on our program for another week documenting every day life in these United States. Each week as , which is theme, but a variety of writers, performers that make it do so to take a walk. back at that day. Today's theme is lessons. Act 1. ski lessons. And in that act we are pleased to bring in spotting gray man who is sometimes called the premier tower of monologues in America. Act 2. Swimming lesson. That will be a straight moron. Scott Carrier. Act 3. How to fire a potato in a graceful art 450 feet in the air. Glasson on hat. Act 4. Or. No, we'll just get that cool when we go. Stick around and learn, okay? Yeah, you can tell we're having the big star on today. Because we're using the big movie music, Clay Glite sweeping across the studio ceiling. I wish you could see it in here. It is actually, I got it from this music off. All over a second, I'm just going to take that out. It's a great pleasure to welcome Spaud in Greater Work Program. Grace probably best known for his monologues swimming to Cambodia, which is made just with each of some of you who is back. He's traveled country for years with various monologues, monstros, and phox, raised in that. And if Aaron seen him, what he does is he basically sits on stage, the table, and the glass of water, and some notes, in the most non-descripted course, and I'm described as possible cause I make no statement at all and he tells the story it's it's interesting actually for this is a solid spot in this work this monologue it's called it's a slippery slope because ... unlike some of them it's a stream which is really transformed at the end of the story he is really a different person who is the beginning ... into into ways that transmission takes two parts one he leaves his long-term relationship this one is just the way for years and years and years so i another woman has a baby with a subordinate. And the other thing is he learns to skate. We're going to put you along excerpt with skiing stories and tells. Spawning great tells the audience at the heights, lessons and school of our types does miserably in any kind of formal learning setting. But somebody gets it in his head that what he wants to do is he wants to skis, skis just seen glorious and athletic. And he and his long-time companion, the nerd, decides to go to us. There we go. We are standing there at a beautiful clear cloud to spring day and ask he professor. He's struck to come south and it notices that he used to be a heart searcher. Now he's retired and doing what he's always really wanted to do, he's instructor. And not you lucky to be here and one of the most beautiful slopes in America. So he says standing on 150 pack powder and we're proud to see this guy looking out over the edge of the bed. When some were so it was instructor, we began to do the first moves. It's no power. Two. And we start down. It's a bit awkward. But I am staying balanced. The ski suns. Blitting need too much. And the Renee, everyone, is in the classic doing fine. And we go into the turns with diverse. And people are going right. Left. And I find it for some reason. I never found that why. I only put turn left. But I was doing that fine. I was doing this great traverses lap. And snow plow down and take a lift up and lap and down and lap. All right. Left. I couldn't come around right I couldn't I thought I had to think my way around into it and Renee now is finished the lesson is up on the porch thing let's get going in this I plane super day I don't think I can go I have to turn right on skis I'm going to do it you I've got to do it small pop the another turn what if there isn't in the car I can continue to check with depression's driving even a big smile and slump on oh no I'll see all the games get to this guy Are we going in with just checking in the bags something see this I go I just reset we go Okay, I'm not going I can't  we made a no no I got it I've got a friend right as he's this is that you're shooting it wait No, no you put the bags I wait a man. Please wait There's a motel up there isn't it I'm gonna get some just a great I need to check you out from you It's fine. I'm not a tably I know you are not flying this I can't up. Oh wait Renella you go ahead. I'm gonna go up there and Maybe I go back to David's side, don't touch. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, she's Christ, I can't touch. -oh, he's not just going over to talk to the head, do it at St. I think there's someone here that should not be fine with us together. Renee leads me over, I mean, well, and she's saying, what is going on? I said, Renee, listen, I'm tied to being a fiery carry. I want to live a life, not tell it. I don't want to do a monologue about not being able to turn right on skis. I want to just do it. I got, I got, oh, she goes time for intervention. Call on your brother. She calls my brother Rocky and St. Louis and says I can't remember here in the Phoenix app or Spudmon get on the plane because you can turn right on excuse Well put him on all right. I rock I'm doing well turning left. I know I could be a skier Yeah, I can't turn right Don't you have a hard line As the street goes spotting great does in fact get them does return to the city that he remains obsessed with the idea that he's going to learn to ski and he's going on And so obsessed with it. And he said at one point how he starts to watch skiing videos. They're unbelievable. They  porn films. I mean similar exhibitionistic gymnastics. Similar music. Similar by Cariest God I feel only I wish I was in the center of that feeling. Eventually Spudding great does finally get to sleep with an acquaintance named Barney on this picture perfect day out of mouth. In ballet the song go take this pole. Barney and I start up with all of the look and we begin to speak. I find I'm going to go into the bushes coming out the other side with branches in my mouth. a bodicelli. And I say I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't. Bobby, I know I gotta do this on my own. You go ski, I'm going over the metal, I go over the metal with greens. I even spy at that time. When I see what I see, see that you speak. And they are taking project each out of fuel-chairs. We put him in McDonald's with his little ski runners and they have holes with skis on them and I think it's all right. If you can't turn right on this slope today, give it up. Now I have no instructor trying to do this on my own and I begin and I'm left in Prash. Yards here. All stop all of it. They're gonna up. But  what I'm impressed by is how wildly I can prash and still get up without anything broken. And... It's laughter crash and laugh crash and then it happens. It's an inevitable. I can't tell you how it happens all the time I think I had to think myself around it was just a shift of weight And I never experienced this in my life in september 1946 I'm Thanksgiving day when I first learned how to pump a swing I suddenly turned right or something turned you and then left right left Down but I was up again left right left people was ski by me real fast. I crash I was ski by me before I crash I was in such empathy. Or I'd be skiing and thinking, you're doing it, you're skiing. Prash! It was so beautiful. It was  Zen, but a little not a subtle. ? If you were present, you crashed and amount, hit you. I mean, and I realized that that pointed all my life I'd been doing a kind of subtle suicide to my soul. I'd always be somewhere else in my head. I always thinking, oh, I could be there. I could be there. I could be there. Alright, wish I was there. But now what I'm skiing, I don't have that. As long as I'm skiing and I'm so excited, I get to have to lunch to join Barney and we go over to the blue slope. And I'm going to ski with him and now it's a two-day day. It is a perfect day that reminds me of the old days the thawton burges books. My colleagues are reading me the West of In Stories when you see the cloud, where the face and a wind puffing out of its lips, at how the clouds looked. Only the white wind was these long chains of stove flores. And then the clouds would pass in the white California sun would light the packs. no, and there were furrows for other people that skewed, we were hopping through the furrows, in other people's rhythm, and we were riding up, we were dancing in the day, I was with a man, and we were just, we weren't talking with his team together, and I couldn't stop at the end of the day they had to restrain me. I tried to bribe the lift operator for another run, Bernie said, easy, easy, easy. You've been skiing for seven hours. I never done anything for seven hours in my life. You never thought of death once. You never thought of death once. went back to the condor, only was driving, I was flat. Not an anxious thought in my hand. Oh, what? I'm lying in front of the gas bar. Have a couple of beers and watch the weather, Chin. Whatever. Deep dream. I'm almost oblivion sleep. Following day I woke up and I thought, oh my God, now this scheme in this life. And I don't want to be in it. I don't want to come down from this mountain. I want to figure out how to stay up here, how to make a living up here, how to just ski. I had a mission. I never felt a mission in my life. I wanted to ski across America, New England. I saw myself  John Cheever started a swimmer, right  yesterday to go. Swimming is way back to that deserted house, through back-cast swimming pools. Only I was going to do what on ski slopes and use my monologue as a vehicle and begin booking them by ski air. And I did. I booked grazing at a me first of all where I had to talk with big master, and I booked it. to do the offer house and give me condo, free ski lesson, and passes the ski and some money. It was a very good deal. And now it was and basically an afternoon or two, you got HX big giant father figure and then you got a bottomel for recycling later you can ski over your breast and food advice, no problem, go home at the end of the day go open and get me that one far. The ticket is in the chain. So I am having my ski lesson on bottom of the course on the lady and I am hanging out waiting for the ski structure Now I'm nothing to do so I'm reading and I'm reading back my skiing Skating is inherently a dangerous thought which can result in personal injury including catastrophic injury death or property damage God forbid property If you are not willing to assume the risk set forth in this warning please do not ski in this area Sign it sign ticket sign for the skis little stubby one sixties so I can turn easily sign sign sign sign sign sign sign sign sign sign sign sign my life away Wait for my ski instructor come out and you squeeze out. Hi guy Okay, let's begin So is that right if I call you Sterling? Let's begin with a little joke, Sterling. Do  the difference between a snowboard and a vacuum cleaner? Oh, I don't. Pents on where you attach the dirt bag. Okay. Slight bend in the knees. Garus boning bend in the hip joint. Great. Prouch and lift at the same time. Good. Parallel skis, flat on the snow. Skis lightly edge. Right? Now, using the turns on each reverse with the down amount and the any speed we saw to side. Now wait, 90% of the weight on the down speed. Wait, wait, don't sit back. All right, I think that should involve his functions. Nothing natural about it. Hey, okay, then, all right, pressure elbows. Wait over the ball, see if he, please don't stick to the ground. Now, the basic to first stance is often referred to is that banana. Right, banana arching. Skin on the banana stuff. You're really falling down the mountains. Another snowboard shoot. That little f***. I am just waiting for one of them to hit me. I'm going to catch in as HMO and retire. Okay. Parallel skis up a skis, slightly leading in front of the downhill skis. Shiftie weight. And let the up skis lean out. And then you're going to hit the pace down the ball line. This will be falling down the mountain. Okay, point your belly button down the hill, banana arching. Okay, just stand and watch the lights first down the moon and then you follow. Just stood there  frozen banana. And ended up going down the Lluvilopper house, fallen grazing anatomy, my ironic. I've got dry aqua place, they've all the exhausted skills. Wow. Take a touch of your favourites. Following dip. I was determined to set skis on HX even though my guidebook said I'm no such extension to get going. And on the way to HX I was recollecting my Greek history. HX here the Trojan was who the Stukers clocked sheep the warriors killed them, hallucinated kill them and then killed himself of the nation. Say, Jack. So I arrived and I get the map and I'm choosing. What trail I should go on based on the name and I choose dipsy doodle in pussy So I'm standing in dipsy doodle talking to myself skis parallel and slightly apart slightly slightly means slightly Red axons flex elbows flexed Why did I make call this joke? Prouching lift to the same time. Wait over the balls of your feet. I never knew my feet at ball. I heard the expression but I can never contact them. Basically I felt  a bad geometry class. I felt all fragmented. I couldn't really get it all together. And Buggie, on these other skiers, going by me, both speed doing that little Austrian angle. Tight ass and bunny hop, skis close together. They go by. But they know something there to go. On your left. I mean, you not allowed to fall on each act. If you fall, you go by and go. On your left. But in the office, so you're right, guys, can help you up. But I'm skiing. I'm skiing and I'm going down. I haven't got any inner shielded employees. Don't voicing me, saying you're doing great. But to know what I don't have anymore, you don't have to self-deprecating your sh**. You're no good, you'll never master this voice because the mountains, not gonna this sh** out of me. It's hitting me. It took that voice away. It's such a... Wow, that beats you up. It's a plummeting. It's  the father I never wrestled with I'm down Boom, and I'm up again, and I'm spying it and I'm skiing and I experience this zen miracle. I'm hungry without looking at my watch And I ski on down. I don't ski the whole mountain. This is halfway down to little plummeting restaurant Bondies. Hey, I feel  a skier now. I can eat with them on the deck. Take my skis off Follow me minutes now. Clop on down  a man on a moon big ski goes watching on the deck. Order a well done hand brother to avoid the cold. You sit out in the sun. Oh my god I got a pinch of my soul. Fat lady has a son. This is really happening to me. Is this buddy Greg Greg, dear you're a very good hero and speed and ask him. Alone, able to be alone. He curts me that this was a moment I was happy. Well, my son. I was doing his I see. That's it. I see. I'd say this is really good. And also I see three people coming from the office all of these people have probably seen my show and how I do it. And they come over there, I  them, they're locals. First one is me and she's Maggie. She's male. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. at bottom of them all, taking time off the day off the ski, and they want to ski with me. I say, oh no, no, I'm not really scared with the faller, really. I'm up here falling down. Don't, don't, don't, I'm having a good time alone, it's fun. No, no, they're not interested. They ski the mountain hundreds of times. And Jake's trying to give me this line, the pack's being, so I really learned skiing in the group. He's got this theory, the baloney's dance master's, he's telling me. That's how they teach their students, Connecticut, so they dance and write, all right, all right, all right. I'll give it a try. So we go over in damn it all of this, please don't feel good. They always do when I put them on a first feel  two y'all trying to walk again. They're crossing. I'm flopping around. I fall down. They're waiting, they're laughing, they're doing fun. But damn it, shake it's right. The act of mimicking me is able for some reason to connect with me. And begin to ski  emily. So my skis are more powerful. Getting up more speed, in fact, they're almost  crashing into him, but becoming one with him until I try to get back to myself when I crash. Because I don't know how to make the transition. But something's happening. That is right. And Maggie's a good proffin. It's not about marijuana, but she wants to be  in a time where I live. I don't know. No, no, thanks really. That stuff just makes me think that they're going to. Well actually, I think it's the wrong word. It'd be a scholar that was the case. It just makes me grind my gears. Junkhead, round around, garbage. Nothing for talk. I mean if I was dancing all night. It's probably something I take, but oh Maggie says really it's fun. Skeaks  dancing in the delts  dancing in the light. Don't say no, just say maybe. She next time round Maggie and I are alone on a double wall. She just passes, likes it, passes it over. I don't think. I don't  this girl. Shh, shh, shh, has it back? And I begin to think. I begin to think so hard that I don't get off the lift and it goes around. They stop, but I'm hanging up there. He goes, hey. Rock and roll hey man having a good day They helping me down the skis of falling off. They are too big I think the marijuana is making them seem too big but I have to say the fence of the ham bit really does loosen up my hips Not the supposed to have loose hips when you're skiing but looking around I'm skiing with Jake now I  that I just do a male thing because usually I always go ahead and talk I'm skiing together and I'm operating for aFF No, he said don't freeze up. You're doing fine, you're turned. But do  what after you turn, you're sliding down the mountain, sliding down Isn't that it? Just watch me. And look over over, well, see it. Do you think it is? Rolls, just, just, , you're just, oh, yes. I think it's a lot of things. We are skiing now, down. Ruthie's run, A to rain that was so steep I was in the crash of the wall and now I am realizing that you have to out of control to the feet for a second to have to be pulled down that fall line then catch yourself you have to have a looping  that,  build that there you've gotta believe you're gonna charge right for all this time right and it's leap of faith  wow  down the street until there's so much and we can face it and I'm around it falling into the light and I can feel the gravity pulling me to the earth the mother and leave a faith I'm around and leave a faith I'm around and leave a faith I'm around and make you shoot behind me with stereo earphones on yelling think of it as a white wall of death and I'm able to keep my balance in the face of this and I know where she gets her kicks and I know she's hoping I'll do a monologue about this and she will be in it we have a wonderful afternoon it's timeless it's so interchange so oh So, and they say they did pair well, we say it's almost 4 o'clock,  what's wrong? So no, what's going on? It's falling,  what? It's leaners. It's only one way down the mountain, ending the trail, spot on. Look at this bird that often, it's down. It's shadowing. It's icy, it's dark, shadow comes in. Maggie Bluer ACL, attendance out last year, your pop, those pops, don't want to do it. Do. She got chized. So I up with the plan is follow mom, the plan is always. Hands speed. Her hands speed with her yet. She was struck in the water. She was  a sneak breeze. We were really smooth. What's exciting now is... We're in the toss. We're going to skiing around the top. We're starting down. It's all this new terrain. we get closer to Sparkle, I can see what they mean. The conversions. All the trails are going into that one place. And behind me, I can hear the snowboard is shredding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And all of a sudden, Marka goes straight up. The edge of the doll is up and up and up and down and up and around and down and up and around. Update. down up to, to, to, to, to bow, pull on out of the thighs of Hacks. And Jake comes over and gives me a big high bar. I first. Did I say thank you? Thank you for skiing with me today. And I've been there while I'm doing it. The Redtopides. You guys Ready to play games. Hey man, you should either be dead or in trouble. So what are you talking about? Do you hear I speak French? No. You stole some lawyers, 195s at lunch.

Coming up, swimming lessons, shooting, haters, 450 feet in the air. Instructions on how to have an affair, and more in a minute. This American life, on my request, each week on our program, of course, which is themed, invited variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme, with monolids, short fiction, mini documentaries, power shows, and different elements. can think of. Our theme today is lessons we are at Act 2 of our program Swimming Us. There's some lessons to think the best classes, always teach more than concrete skills. They help with come fears, change, people in more profound ways. This next story comes from Scott Carrier, who was in Soix. My wife Hillary is a beautiful swimmer, relaxed, graceful, she just sort of slimmers around and top of the wall. I didn't notice about it, and I met her. I knew she grew up on a lake in New Hampshire, but I'd never seen her swim in focus summer when we spent a few weeks at the lake visiting her parents. She liked to swim at night, go far out with darkness and her turn around and swim back to the light on her parents' house. So this summer we were there at the lake, and my wife and her mother decided it was time for her to be in a half year old daughter to take swimming lessons. I said, no, she's too young, and my wife said, Mr. Switzerland likes the start of the three and a half. I said, whose Mr. Switzerland and my mother in Russia gives lessons in the pool next to his house. It's a nice, petal eliritus room. He taught all my kids this. He went to Harvard and then coached at a private school with a good reputation. I said, oh, well, then of course, in my wife said, Monday morning, we've already signed. you can come with us and see for yourself he's a good teacher. So, Monday morning we drove the hell in Betsy Switchers, Quadick School, Center Sandwich. The club was dark blue, the color of glacier lights, 60 feet long and nearly ringed by mother sitting white plastic luncheon. There were about 18 kids in the pool, couple of pretty college girls teaching me intermediate dance students, Mr. Switzerland, the and square jaw big muscles in the pool of the shower and the beginners . Three boys and three girls hanging onto the edge, crying and shivering, or actually in just the three boys who are crying. One of them tried to cry not a little pool, and Mr. Switzerland pulled me back in and say, you stay there, you stay right there, and don't own it from that spot. That course made me. The other two boys forgot even more, and one of them is crying first morning, getting a Mr. Switzerland pointed to the mom, and then pointed to the gate. She popped right up and walked down. In the lesson, Mr. Switzerland took the kids one by one, and stood over moving their arms and legs through the water. He did this even to the kids who were nearly steric. Goodhh go under the water keeping their eyes off to look to grab the fingers. Then he had them get out and walk over to the edge where the water was deepened. They were all standing in shaky, holding their little hands over their little hearts. He was going to make me jump. Now listen everybody. I'm going to jump in. I'm going to jump in. I'm going to jump in. I'm going to jump in. First he told my daughter to jump and she did just about an end of our Oil Down. She was kind of screwing around and having too much fun. Next, the other two groups, and they jumped for me, too. But then the boys, boys were afraid. They were just little kids who had learned to hide their fear. But look  truth here. That's some sudden fright caused by a bad dream or a monster movie. But scared, so had the body's grivering night gelo. Their face is 4-3. Okay, two more more. Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Come on! But they did it or at least two of them, some of their courage, lead into their fear and jump. For then, it was a wild and real as it gets. But the other little one just couldn't do it, so they pushed it. What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? What are you doing? I got the heightrop. Björka! After the rest of the day, introduce myself, this is what's in it. Ask the fast practice. We, as soon as we start working the arms with a 3.5 year old, we're basically working the arms that we wanted to work with, they were on. And you saw it today. A couple of the real cars, they don't know what they're in for, but then they find I'm a good one. They find that if I say I'm a catcher, I'm going to do something. And then... on foot. Let's see, this class is your watching the self-enemies of a little bit of one class. By the end of this week, the world will be most look-walked from the right, which is what we're looking at. That's the same as a black. That's the black. Now most of them will not have any good near-per-conceptual, many of whom will just kick the normal matter, but what that does is gives them... ahead in the waters. It gives them their confidence that a station fall off the bat. They can look around at the water and get a question at it. 1.2. 2.8. There was less crime. And by the second week, things had calm down to the point where I started being against collision炊 ??? Cits namedys812-years-old swiddiness. practice the same slow skill, reaching far out ahead and slowing back, relax, breathing immediately, relax. They were learning to swim gracefully, fighting across the pool scooper, walking with folks on. They were all learning to swim exactly  my life. He was strict, he was strict, but he's not me. I mean he used to say things, but you don't relax your hand and it's great. But  that he wasn't being mean. That's what he would say. And somehow he had to say to me, that as a kid,  that he probably was the order of the... And his father's teaching, he just... He expects you to do it. And that kids know what you expect him to do, and all expecting to listen to you, they know about. And I want you to fuck. What's up? Are you ready? Come on! Come on! Come on! This is the final lesson. Mr. Switzer, please be getting faster, the bag and forth. The gun is in the jump and sweep the left. The most is of the bullets. I need to look at the bullets. I need to look at the bullets. You want to shoot this. Don't be thick. You want to shoot the bullets. I need to look at the bullets. Oh! What do you have to do? Oh, no! Oh, no! They all jump and we all scream. And then it was open. You Now our daughter Alice has a car and she's passed the beginning one month. At the slitor it quite. school. Next thing I know, she'll be swimming far out of the way at night. This is Scott Kerry. I want to be a heartless and cuddle, Splose to the side can do. Fast the last of me.

She is a big, long after school. She is a pretty big, long after school. At three, shooting lesson. For my sister Randea's two kids, both boys, and she's the kind of mom who declared early on. No guns, house. She got a tough run. She said in her basic liberal soccer mom. Jesus came up in our national debate that's my sister. Saka-mama. But by the time each nith then in Sam turned two years old, it became clear that the drive to play with God's, for whatever reason, was more powerful than one mom could stop. They would make guns out of anything. They'd make guns out of sticks. They'd make guns out of crayons. Once we were having a spaghetti dinner and I saw Benny, make a gun out of a new... He tried to shoot someone with a noodle. Boys and guns. Boys and guns. What Kitty Feldi is a reporter who's best known to public radio audiences for her coverage of the OJ Simpsons in trial. And not long ago, she headed out into the Hills above Berkeley through the Cousins husband, and got his name as Jim Gray. And I should expect him a Berkeley area family. Jim Gray is the kind of... of liberal who would not go out in the big rifle on weekends shooting at game. He's not, , killing little rabbits and squirrels and stuff to feed the family or anything. He doesn't march on Washington to preserve our rights to assault weapons. He's not a member of the NRA. But even this liberal guy in liberal Berkeley, even he found a gun to love. And it turned out that it was a very particular kind of gun. that every Every time he showed it to another man, the reaction was always the same. The guy always said, I don't want one of those two. It was a potato gun. In his front yard, overlooking sparsely populated hills, gave kitty a lesson and it's operation. Everybody in the neighborhood is making use. Everybody in the neighborhood. This is my Spudgun, homemade Spudgun made out of ABS sewer pipe. He's mentioned half ABS. us to a reducer that goes to a 3 inch ABS combustion chamber, female coupling and a nail plug. Pellant is hairspray, which is the amazing part. We'll get to that in a minute. Now, this is who thought this up? It was shown to me actually by a guy who's almost sort of quasi-malicia. He found it, his buddy showed it to him. They liked to fire it at night for the blue flame. And I made one here and instantly all. All my neighbors had to have one, I need to write an external bill on. But anyway, it has potatoes as ammunition. Cram, potato down the barrel. It's actually a potato musk. Also referred to as potato cannon. I call it the spread gun. You didn't use all of the potato there. Well, only that will fit in the inch and a half pipe. You have to use potatoes bigger than the inch. and a half pipe so that you totally fill the pipe. Now you're using this long dowel. Yes, it's a ram rod. Just a musket people use pushing the winding down there. The next step is three, one second blasts of Aquinet hair spray into the combustor. Quickly putting the male plug in. Scoring on the end to this plastic piping device. Now watch this direction. Oh, when this can be really loud, I gotta get back. This is too loud. Man, my ears. Where are you? How are you igniting? This is a comb and wandered igniter. You spin the neural den and you get a spark on the inside. Wait, I get back there. Okay. Oh, now the sputters. Just take an lovely arc about a hundred feet away and has dropped behind the trees over there. And that totally useless, we just wasted a potato. No, now what are you doing? Well, I'm using these vise grips to... I'm fastened. It looks  a giant pair of pliers, kind of three inch wide-end-end pair of pliers, you're unscrewing the couple. That's true. To reload. To reload. It's a slow process. if you were being attacked by an army, it would be dead by now. Well, I would think the liability problems having spuds landing in people's yards perhaps on their bodies with the... a problem. Yes, that's why we sort of do it secretly. Oh, good one, good one. I can't even see it. Yeah, that was a good about 400 to eat something  that. That was a long one. So none of the neighbors have complained about this. They've just asked how can I make one myself? That's pretty much been the, usually it's a guy thing. It's a guy thing. And usually I show it to the guys and they instantly want me to either make one for them or show them how to make one and I'd say there's at least half a dozen but更itive that have sprung from the original pair. Ah, the, the legality of the thing is a little bit. question, well I've actually asked police and the police wanted me to show how to build one when I described it to him. I can just jump in here for a second. So Kitty stands out there with her cousin's husband and at some point a neighbor comes over and they get to talking about all the improvements in making the spot guy. And as they talk he starts to realize. The boy desire for done and doneness is so powerful that these guys are gradually re-inventing the God. They are turning the Spirit into a real God. Well, as soon as I showed it to my neighbor's sound, they decided to do design improvements. They tried increasing the size of the combustion chamber. They tried decreasing the size of the combustion chamber. They tried putting a valve in so they can inject pure propane as opposed to them. to get a more explosive issue. They tried different materials for the gun itself. And here comes Tom with a couple of version two with a longer barrel. So say they're here. So Tom, this is the mock two version? Yeah. We've decided that the longer barrels don't really make any difference. Both Jim and I have tried shooting next to each other. Both have the best scene right. We've also used profane as opposed to air spray that didn't seem to matter either. So... That's nice art too. Very nice art. I think it took to the job site and the ripper was up on the riffy. I'm sorry I've been playing it as weird ones. on the hillside, parked way out there in the roof of Pocus, and said, if you've got it, make me one or show me how to be. So is our name with this loose knit organization? We're not yet, we're actually trying to avoid any. We're hoping not not not not to be considered a group. We don't want to, we don't want the attention of any, of course, maybe to see what my track is down and consider as militia or some other. See you in the next video. No unifying political. There is no absolutely no unifying political. No, this cuts across the spectrum from liberal to conservative. Nothing unifying politically at all about this. It's a guy. It's all the reason. Kitty Feldy. Did you say I've got a lot to learn? Well, don't think I'm trying not to- Since this is the perfect spot to learn. Teach me to learn. Starting with the ABC of it. Right down to the XYZ of it. Help me solve a mystery of it. Teach me to learn. The skies are black, old. Hi, I'm Love You. And if a shooting star goes low, I'll use that star To write our love you, a thousand times across the sky One thing is very clear, my love Sure the teacher stands on you one long Graduation's almost here, one long It's raining night We are progum today is about lessons and when we turn to John Conners, a guy who helps to find music progum for songs. When we asked him for songs, he said that it turned out that they're all... lots of records that are lessens in various types. a guy, I'll be punching them here that he gave us. Here's one on wine, come a guy, had we know which wine to serve a dinner, Mr. C'shell, which is a vintage wine, and what is the difference between vintage and non-vintage? Well, this record I hear answers questions on that. Here's bizarre secret formula for a beautiful new view, but I have to say, favorite of our little radio staff is wine. One that. Itifies we're… Hello, I'm Helen Dirling Brown and I'll go to book called Sex and the Same Ocarong. I had so many things left over to say, not necessarily the single girl that you married girls and men that I'm putting some of them on this record. There's so much to cover though, either I think we're just moving right along, let's start with some advice to men on how to have an affair. Now, I'm not a forest or a firebol accident, but lighting ridiculous to pretend that it doesn't exist, and I think there's far less heard in more joy for everybody, it's certain rules of fallen. We will not be having a fair start, in my opinion, through a married man, is to run to the girl and say, honey, my wife's taking the kids to the country, the cost is clear for you, need. The fact that this is a convenient time for you has absolutely nothing to do with the situation that it's certain he isn't in the affidisiac. It might be more flatter to the girl at your wife or in ten. Another thought, on the first date, don't suggest that a little lobster house 50 miles up the coast which you think is delightfully faint. She knows what you're doing, you're hiding her out. And the beginning is to be sure you go first class. Alright, let's say the affairs on. How do you keep her happy? Never assume physical relationship is the all. out rewarding thing for her that it is for you it just isn't. You believe she does enjoy your beautiful bronze body and  she does. This is America. She's a nice girl. She's a product of what her mother and grandmother told her and they probably told her never to do what she's doing with you. Also, her body needs to have a baby. A lot of men offer her sex. Not your superior brand of course but watch. She'd really  to hear from somebody as an offer of marriage. Presence take the pressure off so do give them. Money has a perfect way of wonderful present. No it isn't happens in solving the hub  the thing. Nice share of general motives or a US e-bomb, tapping with a bottle of arp hairs, really are very hard to take a fence off. Don't expect your girl to share your wish and not to be seen or to keep the lipstick off your collar. So get to your best counselor Alie Maybe it sounds perverse, but a girl may actually take a certain offbeat pride in being seen with somebody else's attractive husband. If you do run into Fender the Family, don't cry to burrow your baby child, just just smile and be gracious and introduce everybody all around your trap, no explanations and no apologies. Never drink up her booze without replacing you. Really are being a lot more in the suit. Never. Never never let her spend the birthday alone even if you have to lie your way in the purgatory to get out of the house. Never lie to her about little things. The big lie you're living at, someday the tour you're going to be married, is going to be hard enough to explain more time comes. Be sure she can trust you in smaller matters. Treat your girl with great dignity. a princess. Never. Never cheat on her with any. the real life. The records called Lessons in Love, Kevin Billy Brown.

That it talks to a man and dead. In the woods. Little man, you'll have a busy day. You can be especially successful with women if you're short and honest. Now I want to talk about sedentaries. A secretary offers the only kind of lit-moory recognizing this country. The chance to have a second wife at the same time you have your first one and not go to jail. If you're selected carefully, she can be the loveliest of all formspanathents. And again, the company pays for. turning your secretary into a girl from his one big advantage. where she is most of the time. It's that's what you want, and I suggest you first follow the proceedings rules about getting another girl to the brim in keeping them happy after she's there. However, I'm inclined to go along with a Broadway musical number that says, a secretary is not a charm. Why not let one of the other guys at the office hire the gorgeous girl for a secretary and then you borrow her for whatever you had in mind in the end. That way you can keep your own secretary to do more important things  running your life in both screen your ego, protecting your mother and your uncovering for your endah sending out percentages. If the girl who should be doing all that is a ravishing red hand that you're all to rock her body or wind up doing those things for her. Besides, all romances end or they end in marriage and you soon be out of a secretary again. If you want to pay it smog. and have you sit retiree love you and stay with you a long long time then follow these rules. Bring your presence from your trips, baby kangaroos. Alright, alright alright. Let's see, let's move on shall we in a little collection? No, a little collection. We sincerely hope this record will be helpful in teaching your aparicate to talk. Remember that your bird is an imitator, and learns to talk by listening to what you say. 나묘 words and sounds, but inflections don't say good morning, say good morning.

It doesn't just give you the important advice,  the diligent, pick a time every day to speak to your bird, make sure you're not trying to talk to your bird when he's eating drinking or playing. It encourages you. It tells you how to take the right tone and then it offers proof. There are people who still doubt. that a pararchy can actually talk. So we have recorded here the voice of one Chicago pararchy, conversing with his own. He is six years old and has a 400 word vocabulary. What is your name? Peter. Peter. Why do you live down? I think you're wonderful. Do you want some breakfast? It's really just amazing what they can get animals to do today. Well, that's that's fun, a little collection.
