  "text": "The reason editorial from newspaper in Jackson's State, the Kyri and Ledger, my tober 6th, 1987. If you want an insight in how legalists are going to establish a social equality, and there are three paragraphs from an authentic report of a meeting of the Negro Cruising Society in that city. And then of course, no report. To those who fell to attend our recent court of a meeting, he's a minister of the last minute we were able to get Mayor De La Speaker. at a very interesting talk. I let a discussion of the book coming campaign, take a Negro boy home tonight, which I'll agree with you in the fine step forward in human relations. Just to be inaugurated soon, in cities high schools. Mayor Daily told us that he'd been advised by an outstanding sociologist for the vicious heat sent fears rooted in racial prejudice and fascist bigotry, to best be combated by closer and more intimate relationships between Negro boys and white girls. Therefore, so you can't pay more attention to white. high school girls to volunteer to take Negro boys to their homes for dinner and date them afterwards. These girls will get higher marks than other privileges for promoting a traditional harmony, to share the white parents that it's all right to have these associations. Now we must all do our part. Make sure that Negro boys invited to the White folks' houses take a bath first, put on a white shirt, then we'll prove that these are good companions for the white girls and socially acceptable. Please cooperate to make Mayor Dale his tap. in the success. Then I'm after that the intro continues. So that's the way to try to establish racial equality in Chicago. The equality with mis-sagenation, smarages, also adultery, astridian, and mangroveization. It is happening in Chicago. But we try to misacity the NAACP ever gets a good and important. But  the most interesting thing about this campaign, taking to your boy home tonight, is that it is complete fiction. No such campaign ever existed in Chicago. And if it did not, it's unimaginable, any real Chicago and who ate, Mayor Richard J. Daleick would have endorsed it. These kinds of articles appeared in Southern newspapers, at least as far back as the 1920s. Lies made up by segregationist forces to scare white people about this threat, racial integration. And the lies were... for a while. And then, integration came in what? Which brings us to today's radio program? Today we bring you two stories, people who tried. One way or another, you bring a Negro boy home for the night. Everyone is a story that is a marriage. It's a story that is trying to take a kid out of the ghetto. I put them into the Ivy League, on why that's so difficult. You will be the easiest cargo, public radio international, to some American light, or a class, stay with us. This is a typical letter home from college. There's a church at about a time that needed to be fixed. Senior class pictures, how much they should cost, and she paid for better ones, so we're Grandma, they've been better ones. And then slowly, the woman writing a letter gets to the whole point of the letter. I went to a good play last night. Miss Alliance by George Bernard Shaw, a friend of mine who's in. it, but he wasn't any good. I went with Richard Robinson. I'll walk. A track runner, singer, dancer, all around good luck and religious and  by everyone. He's one of the nicest people I know, and he's Negro. I had to tell you. I've never kept any secrets from you and this wasn't going to be one. I hope you're not angry. Even you would  him. No in mind it. Bill Crow was there and real nice to both of us. I don't know why there has to be a racial problem anyway. I had so much better time with him than I do with Bob or Dick. a kid or a dog for a redger heckin' me and you treat it  a queen, sad isn't it? Please don't think I'm being a rebel. I love you both very much and I'm proud to be close enough to my parents to tell them everything. But they're not I know they will disagree with me. I'm sure it makes us sad that if people I love you, okay? I'll do it. I'm not sure if you're being a rebel. I'm not sure if you're being a rebel. The narrator of our first story is not actually this woman. It's her son, named Rechromson, one of the three children she had with the Negro boy, after she brought him home for the night, and married him. She and her husband got together in that period in the 60s after the passage of the voting rights act and before the assassination of Dr. Markovic. And they lived in Dream of Interaction Marriage for 12 years. And then, around the time that our nation started edging away from goals and ideals of civil rights movement, this would up. The woman Julia has been... Mary to a white-gun in jam, man Richard, senior, remarried to a black woman named Debbie, and each of them returned to their separate segregated worlds. Leaving the kids to figure out what to make the whole experiment. To what degree did race pursue the part, destroyed the marriage? And for that matter, to what degree had race brought them together in the first place? Well, a few months ago, their son, returabans, went to figure out the sound, and they were subjects that had never discussed, and cried out of it, never discussed with him. I'd  to experience. Who's the star? When I started working on a story, I didn't realize there was a question about my life. My life today and the heart of it. Then one Sunday morning, I got into this discussion with my roommates and topic switch from my parents to mixed marriages in the sixties to me. I was saying that a date both white and black women, they were saying I was crazy. Move it. Sam? She's happy. She's happy. She was white. She was white. She's so white. I will, my friend. They started listening to all the women that they know I've played. About 7, Sam was half Colombian. Juliara was Brazilian. Amanda? Amanda? He gets me wider. , she's more right than the white people's right now. , I don't know. Who else? And Amy? Can't get any wider than her. Juliara? Okay, I'll give you... 10% darkness over there. Why you're so worried about this? You worry that you're gonna and the marina will go. First of all, I'm never gonna marry a white girl. What's that? It's just that idea. Because it'll never understand. I had a lot of thought behind my answer to the question. I just knew in my mind that I had answered. Though I had never said this out loud to anyone. I was just assumed I would never marry a white girl. But those relationships don't work out. Probably because I watched my parents in a racial marriage end. I assumed that race had something to do with it. Then my blonde hair blew out Indiana Fargo mother. My black, Brooklyn, one father, were doomed from the start. Destiny ended up in several worlds. Now that they're divorced, my parents' integration is completely undone, except for my sisters' name. Go if you ask my white grandmother, my mother's mother. My sister's nigh on proof of anything. I said, you don't sound  a black person, then you aren't black because I'm white and you're my grandson. Black people should sound a certain way. They do. I know why they should are down. Do all white people sound ? Oh, Major. No, there's a few of them that sound may sound a little black. Or a little black bear from the south, I'm just should say. But I don't know. No, no, no, of course they don't know. Sound black, but you sure don't. But what does black sound ? I want to know why you didn't have many black friends in high school. I never saw you with a black person in high school. Are you about to tell me that you had to black friends in high school? That makes me black. But I just... I'm just getting back at you. You're  you're almost  your queues in me. So how do you see your kids? Are your grandkids richly then? White? I really do. Why is that? Because I'm white. I don't. I can't help but I just. I just can't see you be a black. Just get it. Really? It didn't bear us anything clear black, grand children? Not to me it isn't. I don't think I got any black touch or... Now it's all. So my grandmother hasn't issue with me being black. My parents have issues with each other. And I have issues with white girls. But that's today, and everything's already messed up. Let's go back to her simpler time before it all began. Go black pass. that's went to Indiana University in the 60s. That's where they met. Mom had developed time, choosing college on scholarship. She was going to be a foreign language major, and when she graduated, she was going to be a translator for the UN. Part of the plan was to go to Europe for a semester. When she came back, roommate had been assigned someone else, and she'd got the new roommate, black room in Clara. And that was my first experience of really mixing black kids. Because Clara and I went go to lunch. together or meals together and I would sit at a table with black hands. And so that's that was really kind of how it happened. And then I started going to functions with Clara, Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. So I think it was just, I don't know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it bright broadened my way of thinking perhaps. If I hadn't gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don't think it would be happened. Well, I used to go watch and practice track a lot, which was over here and went over there. Because that was- If I'm an introvert around the Indian University campus, she showed me where she and my dad met, but they lived. The way they went to parties and dances and my dad's black attorney, and they could signify. the other thing that was just kind of- Hart for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10 o'clock at night and at least 10 o'clock maybe later and We had dorm curfews down and I was still a pretty good girl. I didn't stay out all night So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn't get back into the dorm No, it's not nice to be honest. I thought I should be starting the party  normal white people do And everybody else is the other thing. Everybody else who've begun in their dates already. I'll be the only person left in the short-term point. What party you start? Man, the black girls left a short moment. Girls are gone already. My mom was so white to me at that moment. Growing up, I just thought of her as my mother, but as she told me this, she seemed  the whiteest white person in the world. I asked my mom how she met my father. She said it when they kept it. She's a Clara. We were standing in line. I remember exactly when we were standing in line at the cafeteria. And which it was so many people in front of us around the corner. we could see him sort of maybe 30 feet away. And I said, there are much enemies we took him. He is gorgeous. And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these fated, almost thread bear corduase that fit in  a glove. I mean in his muscles we're so defined and trapped. that he has some leg muscles which is called through these g. And I wanted to mean him because of his legs and stare at me. Or it's totally lust. What a track of you smart. But I think he was the time to be born here in terms of wealth. Oh. Martin Luther King. You go out to look into what the end opened to any race and think and things will change. And then everybody will find the accepted as anyone else. That's about as far as my father goes when he talks about dating my mom. He doesn't talk about her. He talks about the openness of the 60s and the attitude of the era. As if the 60s and the age of my mom instead of him. My mom also recalls me caught in times. I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world at that, you know, John of Kennedy and then Martin Luther King, that the world was going to change and that we wouldn't live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in. And there wouldn't be any research that's when I saw it. even my parents was an activist, they weren't trying to change the world. But clearly how the father fighting each other was the thrill of mixing with something of the other race. After year of dating, my mom got pregnant and decided to get married. The ceremony was small, both my parents' families just proved to be an image. In fact, my father's sister Bernice remembers my white grandma and called my black grandma down the phone for the wedding. To propose that they found an interracial coalition to stop the marriage. Need a grandmother to remember us. Anita came to the wedding. Oh, this was written the night of our wedding. Tonight is the night as I guess Janie has told you. We talked to Pastor Stephane, Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study final exams and moving up. I'm going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress size 11 it fits me again and a white, nantia and black and black pattern shoes. Daddy of sending you my tax statement would you rather I fill out the forms? I'm taking personal finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things  that. Have you told grandma and grandpa yet or Janine and buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is okay but I'd rather tell everyone now. That's all for now I guess. I'm so sorry that it's so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road for now and but we can do much love. After I was married to him, I didn't take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to my. It's very family-oriented. He came from the middle class up-ring, which valued education and so I didn't think it was very difficult to be married to, even though I hadn't planned Because the things that I wanted out of a marriage he wanted to And she's still simple things   going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was gonna eat. I didn't have to cut into a change It was just I Guess it was easier than I expected I can't that's that's a stupid example But I didn't have to change anything about my I didn't have to change anything about the way out I was church, he went to church with me every Sunday. he fit right in. He was in his fraternity and his group of fraternity friends. He was very outgoing, funny,  you are. People laughed when he made jokes and It's saying really good and a lot of their fraternity functions they would have with the call of a mind. He was in his little quartet with Arthur's somebody from New York and John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else knew it and they did all these little temptation numbers where they would dance to handered. And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the hearted it, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn't know him at all. In fact, we had sex together all the time. It wasn't a time where it wasn't  you, sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. See, doesn't talk? You can't get to those of it, you don't talk. Bernice and Grandma said they were both surprised. They were going to do it very important to us because... Because he don't talk. That's right. That would be the same. This is the thing about my talk. It doesn't talk. Everyone... the family knows this is a established fact. No, I'm not in the property of my dad. My grandmother says he learned this from her. This, this way. Don't you think? He talks so much you get in trouble. With who? This thing's based on talks of what? Yeah. The long term plan after graduation. Let's move to profile. back to my dad's hometown. My mother wrote home about. Bobby is so excited about going back all his friends are there and I don't think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country but I can't believe I thought it was going to happen. I was , I'm sorry, here for you, bro. I'm telling you, Rich, I don't understand what's this. I'm so small, yeah. No! Obviously not! Turns out my dad will manage his things too. We're gonna change the lessons you grew up. And there were bombs in the park, and banned the stores and riotiers. That the school where my dad worked, kids were breaking windows, and starting fires, and attacking teachers. My dad hated that there was no where he felt safe, but his kids were at her yard. And my mom hated sharing the kitchen, the cockroaches. The apartment was right next to the aisle, so it was loud and everything, furniture closed, kids, was always covering the final air of the sun. And they were real poor. My father subs to teaching job barely paid rent. And in Indiana, my parents had fun together. It wasn't  that in New York. Everything was all about working and struggling to survive. Finally, something through a brick through the window. Breaking glass on the living room. When my sister and I had been playing when he was early. Within a week, my parents packed you have just straight back. Indiana. They lived in Brooklyn for six months. There's a tracking story begins here. As hard as thanks for our broker. I think my parents marriage could have made that. My dad lived in the world he was used to, surrounded by friends and family , and my mother happened to explore in a different world. But Indianapolis ate away in my father. At first it was just  you wanted. This treats for what? I had cleaned and empty. With trees on both sides, I had grass that was always greener. The canal I managed to be sitting. The knee napolis was the opposite of Brooklyn. It made parenting easy and fun. We flew kites in the summer, and built snowboards in winter. I found an old real-trial tape in my father, my sister had me, and those early days. Fine. What if we'd make you? We'd be our love! We'd be our love! My love is no more. My love is no more. We spent Christmas that first year at my grandparents' 88th farm with my mother's family. That's how a beautiful first day. A perfect first cancer went around and explored. We went back for Easter and then Thanksgiving. Christmas and every year for the next eight years. We practically forgot about my dad's family. That's how my dad's sister found his family. We didn't see Richard again for about 10 years. All you think we knew is we called every now and then, and we knew that he had moved into a trail, and he had bought our house, and then he sold our house, and he had somewhere else. We just kind of casually kept in contact with him. Now was it? We got a Christmas card? Maybe once a year we did a phone call. That was it, it was completely attached from the family. In this new world, no one was black except my father. He never saw his family, he didn't make any friends, he didn't keep his touch with his old college friends. I asked my dad to be hung out with me in the Indiana when my parents were married. Well, I don't know, let me say hang out. Okay, this is that you go to the terms of the gatherings, but I don't know. I was getting out with anyone. Thanks Dave. I was kind of pretty much a ma'am or pretty much with them. Entity within myself is just mainly chill, not chill. It was nice friends at all. I used to think it was very sad. I never feel in the sweat. But a few times we went back to New York. He would flip into a whole altar person, ,  a schizophrenic personality totally different. We got into New York. He'd be hanging out with Pope Lafine, his brother Lafine, his sister Lafine, drinking a lot, hiding just  we remembered him in college before we kept married. It was , , obviously we're back in this fraternity party mode again. Real easy about everything never uptight. Never with this, , this stand that he does, get the sense, just where he looks  he's, , holding everything in, being tough. He never stands that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we come back to Indiana. We go back back into this person again,  he was black men living in the white world, kind of thing that he wasn't himself. You dad never took me to a black class. Everything we did was in... my world. So I don't think that was fair. I didn't marry into that, . When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another cultural environment. I, they have done your sound of foreign language, major. I  cultures. It's important. So he kind of deprived me of our marriage, I think of that cultural experience because he didn't, he didn't contribute. My father became someone else in Indiana, and completely different person. And this new face he put on is the face that I recognised, and that I picture what I think about him. I can't imagine my father dancing in drinking. We're laughing with Pothu black friends. My father had someone that never took a sick day from work, who was always home and always responsible. Here's with Dron and Lonely Father 3 in the White Sin. No one didn't pan out. I didn't have much, I didn't have much, much, much, many of that. I just kind of walked away from all I knew. Everything that was hot, okay. If there was a person now to change, if I had been, as result of that. How did you survive? Well, I didn't think about it. This works as a mouse and raised the children at the time that was a rules of what? I stood face to face in the doorway with my father talking about this for an hour. Neither of us moved, neither of us sat down. And as we in darkness, I felt sorry for him, and I understood why him become who she was. It wasn't exactly that race destroyed in our marriage, but it added to his isolation and subtracted from his person. In that, in the end. destroyed what they had in you. Before I started doing the story, I never talked to my parents about how their marriage failed, but what did the voice was supposed to mean for me? Expressing about who I choose to marry or not, getting my dad sit down for one last round of questions about this was easy. what my story is dad? Well, I thought I was wrong, yeah. Well, I mean, to ask you for no, I said, did I always do I'm doing this story, and I've been a story in my past. You and Mom. I'm trying to use a, , not saying I'm using you as an example in my life, but I'm trying to get a message from you on what I should do because you never have saying things up. Trying to figure out, and here's, here's what I see. You got married to a white woman on whatever, 67. You guys got divorced, and all of a sudden you're over here. and completely now you're in a whole old Paul Blackwell right. You got, well I work with white teachers. Well, all your friends, your family, you're happy now. And she's over there in all whitewell. I mean, I'm trying to be that elucine. I think it's a very important not to go into something. Now I just mix this as you say and as you can get asked me about it. mixed situation if you're very very young. But what about if you're all? I mean, if you're all there, you've got your structure. You've got your friends. You've got, in terms of, I don't think it's mistaken. I think you can do all right. And where you live is still kind of going in terms of the state. Oh. If person were in New York or perhaps you've california. Yeah. Let's try all the... This is not the answer I expected from. He thinks that in her marriage can work. So long as you're not isolated from your own race, the way he was in Indiana. It's not the answer I wanted. , my ex-Asian friend, , she said to me, he said to me, he said, Mary, he makes marriages, she said, you can never marry a white girl because she'll never understand. Well, I don't know what is. And back at that footwork in turn, we were saying other than what you're saying, that they never understand. We recovered from in terms of history or something  that. We can have it. Felt it. Taste it. We're here, I don't know. But some things, apparently, go beyond explanation, just no. Well, and even you have to explain in this of the meaning of the word, the impossible. His answer is sort of ambiguous, for the way I take this, and the way I want to take this, is that he agrees with me, that a white woman will never understand. Did mom ever understand? I don't know if I could say she understood or not. I was doing that she is with, I think that she is, which she is part of her, and part of her. That does mean bad, that is, some of them. Again, the answer is blurry, but that's just the way you talk. I'm pretty sure what he's saying, that she did not understand. My mom is a squeeze, completely. When the color up to talk about this, that's only the less I take. course, is that an irrational marriage just worked? Would I agree with that now? No. No, I don't think I don't really don't think this has anything to do with me. I think I had to do with it. I always thought that I'm married to a black anybody else. You can talk to me if you have a money, if you have a money, but you don't even do on me, do you? And there's not a whole lot of, , the color of the one-pointdependent case. was the only thing that that was different. . But the following department had nothing to do with it. I at least not for my please. Well, since college, I kind of changed my opinion. I don't think I'm in there right. When my friend's was telling me she kind of made me happy when these comments I think they were very white women, too. She'll have to stand. Well, that's probably true. , I'm not going to be upset, Mary, but I'm sure. I don't care what the other is  if you're happy. , nobody has to do these are issues  we live. Everybody has their own personal feeling about it and you don't have to. I asked my mom what I asked her to add. She thinks of white women, can you understand her black? I'm sorry. If you... So we're open-eyed thinking here. If you, , when people get married each other, this is the infant with all of their thoughts. If you are, then you can understand another person. I don't think you're raised in the way of them. What do you think it makes a difference to me? Maybe you're more conscious of it because you're me. It's not true. I know. Do you feel uncomfortable in both worlds? In a way? Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I don't really want to lose either, huh? Well, , that's one of those human dilemmas. You just have to work for it, for it's ? Here's what I figured out during the story. I still can't imagine wearing white women. But not because I believe racism is destroyed by parents' marriage. But I don't really believe that in one. But... because I realized I'm used to crossing between two worlds. I want someone to do that with me. If her better were a straighter wrong, I just can't imagine having a blonde hair to blight go for him, standing next to me at the black quotes aside. As for my parents, my mom says she barely knows you black people in the wall. In the beach passing deck here, she says, who will just got in the water? Meanwhile, my father's going to dance this afternoon, but I'm about to cap her, the same fraternity that threw most of the parties while he was in college. With this time. Martin Gay comes on. The woman he's dancing with is black. It's white. And I can picture her later in the night, often some corner of the room, singing my girl in the light of the brothers. Good job, it's in New York City. The number of intracial marriage. in the United States was 1.1 million couples in the 1990s. That's three times more than in 1970, still less than 2% in all of the regions. Coming up, another person attempts to do withdraw fear in the hearts of segregated. Not that long ago. It's in a minute. From Public Radio International, when our program continues. This American life is my class. People got a book of courses. A variety of stories on it. Today's program. Brain, Negro, boy, home, tonight. And if that's inside of the strange title, then you just have to start listening. These shows from the beginning. The show is stories people define. Some of the oldest quotes for Abraham. by the distances. At one of our shows that it's marriage and two, it's a bit economic integration that tries to make the lead on a poorest neighborhood in country, where our nation's rich school is. Citric Jennings went to Peru High School, and poor black neighborhoods out these flushes. There's kind of school where honor students do not  it to be known that your honor students. There aren't many of them, and when they spot their names posted on the big honor roll bulletin board by the top of thewood Rush, some of them to ask you to take. are when administrators wanted to hold and assemble it without academic awards they would keep the purpose of the assembly secret even from the teachers. Because teachers could definitely think they should be understood. Honor students who would then simply not show up. Well, although I was really proud of my accomplishments, I didn't want to actually see my peers just  to mean in a way. So I just wanted to see. Students at the high school with keys, they would called white. They were asked for signs. threaten with the school violence. As an honest student, said it was constantly taught. He had gone to law and then he had been classroom, went to church, then searched for lies and their friends, and then he would make a loose focus. But the person said that they want to be successful. And after realizing that they will be opposition in spite of what opposition says, and someone says, you can't, , I always, I hate to define it. Side of myself, I say, oh, I can't, no, I think I can't. Sit damping, pet, turn around  this. that he would get established to a top college. He put around such times, starting flying around, and starting to sustain. Stay with him for two and a half years, published stories about him in the Wall Street Journal, which won a few days of college. Said to its first series in counter with the elite universities that he won at the end of, came after his junior year in the summer. Some of our program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, program designed to attract minorities from the two of our team. program is called Mites. MIT, yes, the Nardy's introduction, engineering and science. P50 sample. kids, especially the game neighbors,  said, making into the program Citrix dream. It was the first good old and this new world was trying to end it. But when classes began, Citrix thought we could barely keep up. And even worse, he was just isolated that my team, see then back to the world. Capitalist physics chemistry, well, I thought with kids from middle class backgrounds, good suburban schools, some of them had seen this material before, back home. , it was really a disappointment. And it sort of made me feel inadequate during the process when I'm taking all the notes. They're just , no, I knew he was , oh, no, no. Yeah, that one's never. Yeah, after that one. That was four. I mean, we should say that at your high school back in Washington, in the public school, you were in the most advanced classes there. Right. And I had in even in the most advanced classes, they offered I had done a book and a yarn. So I thought that would be enough to copy. I guess it was. It comes to point. This is moment in this part of Street, which is completely heartbreaking to read. You get back your first test and you get a 4 out of 26 in your physical tests. And a 68 out of 144 in calculus. And your student is usually getting all A's being the star of every class. Well, it was a learning experience that I mean it was disappointing first of all. Please excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. I was just gonna just go crazy. He's done. He's done. I was gonna go crazy. It's 4 out of 26 there's just ridiculous. I mean, there was nothing there. Anyone could say to make me feel better about that. Right, let me ask you to talk a little bit about why the MIT program is set up in this way. At one point you met with Bill Ramsey, the sixth grade girl after America, who heads this program to get on Nardies. into multimedia. And he talked to you about why so many suburban kids were in the program at the same time. Ramsey was a great guy. , an MIT grad in 1951 when there were almost no blacks at MIT. And, , he was hopeful for better. He wanted what I think is the bigger and in some ways more important thing to occur in the MIT program when he took it over several years before Senator Gott there . He wanted it. kids  said you're 50 kids  said instead of one or two. And what he realized early on is that it would run into all manner of dilemmas that go right to the core of the song of the problems with the notion of affirmative action. MIT sponsors the program. MIT wants as many of these kids as possible to eventually end up in their freshman class to make that freshman class look  a rainbow as they say. And as people might mention. You can make the Ivy League or any great college. We're  a rainbow nowadays with that ever having to go to the ghetto. You don't have to go there. They're plenty of middle and upper middle class black and Latino kids to fill those programs. Kids who will eventually succeed at a top university. It's the other kids, kids  Sedrick, for whom the distance is so vast, the travel, that for them the failure rate is untenable for a place  MIT. szer� reading your account of it, it seems  part of this concern too was that kids would come in with that any preparation or without enough preparation to go as fast as MIT would want them to go. And then MIT had no infrastructure to bring them up to speed. And so it was just setting them up for failure. Absolutely. And they often have very big dreams and they often come, push forward by a whole community for whom they're the one who's going to make. And that's a pretty heavy burden to carry to a place  MIT. have all of that compression down in their head. Look, as Ramsey said, look, the suicide rates up here high enough as they are. So, set your get the end of your time with MIT, your informed that you weren't ready for MIT just yet. And you had it back to DC and , put it in a lot more work and a lot more effort. And after you graduate from high school, you went up and I... to explain Brown University. And let me ask you to describe first of all, who you roommate was and what he was , oh, this is back now. He always was my husband. He was from my wife, he was my wife, he was my wife. And he was the one who was the wife of school. He, I think both his parents were doctors. And he was the private school. He was so private school. So he had assisted at Went to Harvard. So I think I think... probably did it wrong and I think that because we can't get from backgrounds that's where a little bit of the conflict came in. Yeah. , I think he came from over. He came from my home where I think he's my pretty much way of knowing him really, really not came from my home. I was pretty much independent. I had to do things for myself, cook myself, wash myself, those things clean up here myself. And , one of the problems that we had was that he was at times, we were both messy at times. especially when work got  it was a lot of work but  but for the most part he there was as we got really really really just messing our rage and just the funky source this reminded me of when I've been in Chicago high schools how you'll see the white kids who the way they'll keep their causes it's they'll just dress  whatever and they'll look  mommy where is the black kids genus  everything always has to be  need and perfect You can close it just so perfect all the time. It's  a few different countries. This is true, but I mean, I mean, if one thing if you just, if your clothes just look bad, it means if your body just stinks, that's just the whole nothing. And I think that sometimes he just is walking me. And , that's just not something that I wanted to put with me, I wasn't willing to put up with me. It just was not much communication between girls. Where they just had utterly distinct, wane. He's doing everything. Sedgrix, , general, , , heightened hygiene. , we're having grown up, , in, , squalid places where, , Sedgrix was clean and all the time. Sedgrix was always careful about how he looked and that he himself and his person was very clean. , was the opposite from Rob, who never worried. I mean, this was just one of a thousand things  that that immediately kind of gripped to have them in ground. until the point where I mean they almost gave the blows. And since the third time, you were really isolated. Yeah, yeah, brown you. I think especially in the social arena, coming from our macro aperture, everything, and, , , putting myself out the gate in the ball and when it gets some of what I was trying to do. Can I ask, when's the first time you actually are trying? I'm never trying. Justice, You still have never had a beer at college? No, not at home. But the thing I raised, you go with the said church church, and you go with the said church environment. The only reason said church is, , God, because he didn't taste of any of the plates in the buffet table, adolescent life in southeast, most of those plates are poison. Ron, let me ask you to read a book page, 1997. But, they won't be able to talk about just this clash of cultures. leisten and his residents are spending serious time and energy having fun. Despite Brown self-consciousness that each student is in the duality, the poor preferred past times are the same here as they are at almost every other college, three-fear, spoke pot, danced, deafening music until he dropped, and on the rare occasion, getting naked with some other warm body. Possibly the best explanation why Senator Jannings is in Brown's class in 1999. He managed to steer clear. or perfated or adolescent experimentation, leaving rightly in turns out that in his neighbor, most of those dishes were poisoned. This was an extraordinary feat considering how peer pressure blew was backed by violence, and the almost irresistible urge for teenagers to serve deep despair with sex drugs and music. Sedrick knows all this, just as he knows his resistives were made possible back when, by his mother's fierce curve. Not eventually, something. else to group. Sedric dating to justify his monkish routine in high school, night after night. Developed the genuine belief in sacrifice, hard work, and extremely clean living, would lead to rewards, including a scholarship to a top college. But now that he's made, guide pros and gone, and all around his hard kids of getting gone, getting drunk, and screw him. Even the real smart ones, kids who can eat, Sedric's launch and bonus any subject. Sitting alone in his bed. one Saturday night, it's not going on. In a few kids from down the hall crowd in, rose into the dissipation of a night of drinking, and off campus party wanted to be heard about. And then who knows, it's late night pizza. Hey, said you're coming on, what do you say? No, said you says, the lighting night song, trying to show you appreciates the rasping. I just don't do that kind of stuff. Everyone knows being a subject to tell they don't really understand. No moment to go. Just as well, things, you have to meaning it. I can't change now. In your view, do you  the biggest difference between yourself and people you were meeting at that? Do you think it was racial? Or do you think it had more to do with class? I think I had more to do with class. I mean, obviously race. I was, , I was, , among few minorities, but obviously laws twin. I mean even within my naughty community I mean most of my peers in my naughty community had gone to private schools and they would pretty much from middle class, I've played home, mother and fathers who both colleges, kids in a lot of cases, we both live in home, we both just told me the opposite of where I come from and in a lot of ways I just I I just felt isolated all the way in my hearing. Did you find it anyway? It was easier to be close to blackheads and middleclass sounds. It was to be close to whiteheads and middleclass sounds. Yeah, it actually wasn't different. Yeah, we had more in common. We had more in common. We were working for more design things pretty much. It's interesting to think about this in terms of just the history of integration. Putting together this show is talking to the producers and we're talking about how to put the end of Dr. King's life. one of the things that he looked at, it started to think about was the question, okay, now under the law of blasphemy where, but moving towards economic integration, moving people out of poor neighborhoods, up into the middle class, seems so much more difficult. And reading the account of what you had around, trying to make that class job. Right. , just reiterates how hard it is. You see, it's so weirdly... It's hard to see. It's hard to see. , with my mother and everything, at first I, must mean I was a little ashamed of coming to Israel and, , because I knew that she was not my kid and other parents in terms of what we had. I mean, I got when I looked back on that actually was a shame because I knew that. The other parents, they had, they had a lot of them. It manages to have things right and it pretty much a lot of bad easy. We got it easy. And my mother, , we come from welfare, , she's on welfare she, she dropped out of high school and can pregnant early age. She got a GED. She wasn't college educated. So, , sometimes I was, I was ashamed of the fact that my mother wasn't on the same level as the other parents. So, yeah. You talked to Rikata? No. Because I've been ashamed to admit it, it's a traffic. Or long time I've been in the now about me. But I'm not ashamed to read more. Stop, don't cry. I'm crying. Isn't that a cry? I'm crying. Well, yeah, look at our, look at my son. First, he said, ha. That counts more than the cost of reading. When you would be due situation now, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're your son. I'm not ashamed to read more. right now. I was finished. I was finished. Do you still feel  you're between worlds? Oh you, all the time. All the time. And one standing, working on people who are in the community, working on, it's about not becoming white. And then a braille is  not becoming not becoming white. Yeah, it's the same thing. So what does that become? It's not becoming white. You may not be black in both worlds. Except this sort of. But it's  being black, but in their world. Be a black but in their world, you. Do you feel  you're in this kind of no man's own? Sometimes sometimes. when? when? This. difficult because it's hard. I never really give the lab a word. I get a lot of grief when I come home especially people in my church people who community about going off to this life-mazing image. I just need to do it. I need to do it. I need to do it sometimes. It does isolate me and say I'm sorry. Yes, sometimes I feel alone. I guess that's what you asked. You're not feeling alone, isolated in terms of my decision going to the ground. Did you help? Yeah, I do. I do the alone. Do you feel less alone though? In terms of if you're feeling more alone, did that come to me? Does that mean you're watching me? Do you feel less alone now when you're a friend? And then what if I do? Because I'm wrong. Is that wrong? What comfortable with friends? In terms of feeling at ease, new world that you've moved into. If we consider somebody  your roommate, who kind of grew up in that world as being completely in this, he's  100% in use. Where would you say your percentage is manual? Who was the 20% that that's? still isn't there. I still have a lot of born-up team. I mean, come from Blue High School, which is considered one, where's high schools of DC, a car-not, one-basin-verse-to-even-country, and I'm still not happy. You're still not happy me, you're not happy in a day-to-day way, you're not happy in a fight. I can imagine the day to day, but as it just seems to get so much of a work. It's pretty easy to go. This is really difficult for me to talk to myself. You should have bear with me. plus I'm giving it much thought. It's a trippy. Success is a trippy because, , we push people, especially Blacks to be successful. My knowledge is to be successful. And it wants to get there. It wants to get there. For some reason. and we pull each other back. And you think it's specifically that things are happening now that you're back home with the sun. Yeah, my biggest problems are at home. My biggest worries are at home. All these people who just come by me with, with the, for some people is, , go on to Brown, go on to Brown. It's  I've given up or turned my back to the fact that I'm black. which is totally not the case. And there's people who you respect, and there's people who respect the people that adore, really behind me. That's the toughest part. And that's what's hard. That's what I'm trying to do with success is almost as worse as failure. Browns us kind, great great book that's said you can't explain the code in the Etsy. In the before it interview, and just consider that straight in the present that a black box date. That is that thing the same without my ex, would you, would you first ex, would you marry a black boy a white woman I see? No. They say they are white but we would you marry a black woman that's now we're taking white woman to marry it dear, I'm sure this is part of which does be that a white woman can be used. Sure, I guess. I don't know, I want to keep you warm. I think that's definitely understanding about it. more, , more than we've given the right. 312 e32380, our email address, radio at well.com.
