Blue blooded Yankee graduates from now lose the taxes, starts talking, get old boy, turns himself into a oilman and after that, to present it in the United States. Check us about the independence that Ghee can hit Spiritsby, be made to work, lose to New York, dress some life, the dollar can bridge climbers. A nice Jewish boy from Minnesota, Plexanoki Kwan, Picks looking car, reenames himself for Welsh poet Dylan Pants. the story. One thing that makes our country different from all of the other ones is this idea that it's our birthright that we can recreate ourselves as someone we prefer to be. Several of everything off, moves somewhere else, starting new life. This tendency is so deep in American culture, within an entire industry, self-help industry, knowing as how to transform ourselves into someone new. And usually we see this as a positive name. What happens through two of that? And throwing everything off, starting off from stuff. Of course, it was  key projects was, which out of the depression in Oklahoma, then a creature and training in Birmingham, in the aspiring Hollywood actor. In the 50s he remade himself as the self-stud, the leader, then his man on a great final suit, and the 60s he became part of the New Yorker of the Rottie, and went to the B-days, with the suburbs for 70s era of the party, a storm chained up to the novel and watching India enjoy the experimentation on both phones. help put Ronald Reagan into office in the 80s, he changed the game, and got him quite hit Christian. Not only is his life a history of most of the major cultural shifts the second half of the 20th century in this country. To case study in the question, what happens if you're too good at transforming yourself? Is part of our national character? Well, in the beginning, how to upgrade the international to American life in my request. Today we are devoting our higher program to the story of this man's life, as told by one design, children, Julia and Audrey. He dodged married five times, the left one said of wife and kids after another at most of the major turning points in his life. When he died in 1993, for the first time ever, he did the nine kids got together with the same place, and he spoke, talked about what sort of man he was. And it was then they realized that they all knew different versions of their father. And so a couple years after that, Julia and Audrey, in the sixth trial, said her to break. in some of these different parts. She left her home in New York City, go ahead and interview all of her passive ways without her father's life. Here's your question. When I started this trip, I saw my dad as a quintessential rest of the American. Constantly on the movies, questions, dreams. I knew there was a dark side dog, I saw people left behind, my hair just busted. But still there was some part of his quest that seemed heroic. I'm sure he saw that one too. I was very good last, I was good. It's very good for it. This is how my father taught his own story. It's a church testament for 14 years before he found out. Now I've read out this and what to be a preacher,  my uncle says. And I've kept that, my Lord. On the other hand, not so easily seen, though, as a psychologist, yet in time. 1929- 1953, it's a very good story. My dad grew up in the church of Christ during the Depression and Oklahoma. His family moved to California after Pearl Harbor, so my father could get work welding in the ships to help the war up her. My father got a scholarship to a Christian school, Pepperdine College. He was married in the same year at his high school sweetheart. I'm Shelley. I was from the first married. I was born. In Woody or California? Ah, Dad was young. I started my trip at Sheldon's house in the Jinnorkan, where I see my house's station, my dad's first marriage. He was shelling in his backseat, because I've been sent to the Skuffing Week in the daughter. I'm surprised to be included in my family weekend. We barely know each other. We don't have much of confidence at my father. Yep, we spend three days going white water out from the ceiling down the big ten meals. Back in Spain, Sheldon's morning, we're both Armin. devoted to our families. And she always had fundamentalist Christians, homes, or all of kids, and the boys with parents can, should do better than any small. Still, we're amazing with control from child. And sitting in trouble is living on the top of the night that we were a problem was. He was going to be a preacher. He was going to be a church priest preaching. So he had it all planned out, and that was in the church of Christ community that was kind of the highest social status was to be a preacher in the church. I... I know my mom said she told me that even though he was 18 when they got married she said he was he said he was at my he was 18. It was he kind of ran the youth group at church he was the most influential his father was influential and he was always very sure of himself very confident about his  about who he was very was going he was highly respected even in 18. He was 18. when they got married and she was 20 years old and they were just starting out. Of course, and they had a little apartment over a garage. Somebody's over somebody's garage. This is back. Unfortunately, for their plans, they had me. I think that had a major effect on his... relationship with my mother and their relationship with each other and how he saw his life unfold. I'm sure it really bothered him that he saw his possibilities and elinitified the fact that he was having these three children and he was only twenty three years old. And so dad. the same choice he would repeat over and over for the rest of his life. The simple change to his mind about who is going to be. We began studying drama, growing himself into school players with the same proverb that was being creature. It was costly to him. I think to be involved in drama, he was getting at it. But I think, if I had a hand for him, that's kind of, as you study the history of drama, it gets out of hand for a lot of people. So, we're at that team. his focus is for me to change my character relationship. So how did it break up when marriage with your mom? What happened? It seems  it could be something that you do and you should have a memory. Oh sure, but Dad was having affairs with my many. That doesn't. That doesn't go well. The soon divorced. The three kids back in Shelley and Alan didn't really see their problem much. from the next 15 years. And when I try to get back in, Shelly did tell me more about the person of the father of us when they were children. They can't. They left to relate to them to remember. This is nice. Just a little fill there. It's just as now. Oh yeah. I'm the last day in the gene. Becky Shelley and I go and walk together in the car. Thanks to Shelly's house. Shelly tells me that to abandon him in his phone of the raisins. She's about herself. She's about to look at me. I mean he rejected me as a child he left me he didn't care for me he didn't send money to my parent to my mother to support But I guess it was when I started having my own children that I started thinking how could you how could you have done this to me? How could you I've committed to my children? Why weren't you committed to me? They're feeling about that as so different from one I Remember enough to know that he wasn't but As dad did he would be involved in our life since it? as it fit, as it was convenient for him. The man that we've been describing, this he's found familiar to you and it's so if in what way. I mean, remember what I think? I feel  I'm trying to sort of, , massage us, dad is known as. or the creative part of that. I talked about dad following his dreams, how that came into courage to try new things. But it wasn't the kind of argument or anyone who needs a cinnamon else. I ask Shale if she can see what I saw. I'll start over experience in the band and daughter. No, I do. I asked, but if you say in the cost of your family, I think that's an excuse for. I think that's serious. I think I'm... make a commitment to something you should keep at. Now I think that to try to say that because Dad was talented, that gave him some kind of license to marry women in a band and them, is looping some personal. Each of us has a responsibility to, whatever, a life accountable to some kind of righteousness or value even if you don't believe in God and certainly... that doesn't include hurting people. I still know that nothing Noble in his pursuit after his dreams, that's what pushed him into. Iину him little after Travis Hunter, 1953. Beat in a great final suit. I've got married again, almost immediately. After a violent act, the mass phase of the alive C-8 alarm is not breathing. Power of life is the same as theirs. The animal life is through and our... ...the worships here. She is an act that she is alive. This marriage to this another divine child, your boyfriend, your marriage, and I have to let her have some for me. The clock is in the... that the delay. And I produce the changing of the clock. My dad met a second wife Maggie and actress from Germany in the drama crew. He was in the theater program at UCLA and later a bride that he was buddies with the crowd for Nat and James Conner, the Sydney Potsie babysat and the students for dad helping him get rid of his behavior in accent. No one in the family believes any of us. The facts are. Maggie got pregnant. They got married. I'm Josie and I'm from Keats second marriage and I was born in 1955. Okay. Okay. 25 hours from Shalice has some genes in my half sister Josie and Walter Colorado. Josie's 45 years old and the same person. A lot of first night together, Rana Cada, we can go to Alpine Garden and say hello. We lived on Collie Drive and Hollywood House, , little red house. There's this really the shot that I always remember about the three of us. My mother, the glam actress, your hair and a bun and very red lipstick. How's that? Joan Cough from Ibrouse and I'm sorry. And my father, who is  the All-American guy my name is Nicel Dress, it's he writes underneath the family of the 50s, which that is really what this photo is, it's family of the 50s. However, we weren't the family of the 50s. I wanted to take a lot of pictures. And a lot of them have this quality. They're almost iconic. As if family of the 50s. This is all he was trying to get to family. After being scattered in the theater production at UCLA, that was cast in the bit-part and the Grace Kelly Bridge at Tucker Red. I thought it was on his way to career as a movie actor. Apparently, he had the chance to work at Paramount. And , those were still the days when actors were hired to be contract actors. in studios and what my mother told me was that his his ears stick out a little bit which we all know of they did and my mother told me that if he had had his ears pinned back that they would have accepted him into the studio as one of the contract actors and my mother just really couldn't understand why you didn't do that. That's kind of  dad was . He could have been an aunt onto something. really good that no he had the string and he had to be quite right and and that really never went anywhere as well. So he didn't really believe in all the systems. He's everyone. Yeah. Yeah, he wanted to do fair. I don't think he believed in any system. No rules. Don't. Don't. Then Sniang. I don't know. Well, we moved to New York when I was about three. He went this way. for us. He went to join a group of men who were playwrights. He was encouraged by a friend who is all let's go to New York and we can contain his playwrights. That was a bit impulsive and he didn't  the acting scene in Hollywood. So he decided, yeah, let's do it. He goes with his friend and then about six months later, and my mother and I came after him. In the classic America biography, there are always this heroic moments. The rebel leaving behind your life, picking risks following his or her dream and having a famous. But of course most people who tear up their lives and follow their dreams never make. My dad moved to New York, or nothing of value and had to get a real job. And published. The mayor didn't survive. to move by that. By the time Joseph is fine, keep a Maggie with her voice. But it didn't abandon Joseph as he left behind the case from his first match. Maybe he was more mature, you'd be needed family-move. But even after the divorce it was often a very good dad. And the chose to be was really fun. Played with you, was off the line. He talked to you, and made you feel important. He was intense and voucher in the life. he was playing perfect dad. And what he did with me. He sometimes did sit down and I would dictate poems to him that I had made up of the guitar and for me. So that was a nice little thing that we did as father and daughter. He was kind of giddy, he was funny. I thought he looked  different guy, can act  different guy. I can wish you a different type, this movie star. I think I always wanted him to be a movie star. I mean, I had  his life as a movie. and at this stage when I was  seven or eight or nine, it's kind of  well, we were kind of in a musical singing in the rain and jumping around the streets of the New York and making it songs When did you feel change in your family that was born in the life? Do you remember time? Oh, yeah, well when he married your mother and and and then he started to have a new family who was hurt and yeah that was that was hard for me 1963 to 1969 but erotic my mother Sally was dad's assistant in Carhal publishers she was completely taken to this child she told me she came home first day from work and told her parents that she was going to marry a boss and from the air they were more so much human work for sv an unsaid that we're scare my deep learning to be an artist and my life I could do with ourselves more or less good life. We had closed the money and when I was a rock we had no spirit in the life at all but we didn't listen. We were perfectly. According to my mother, I'd used to say that in Marita for two reasons for ass and a family. That seemed to think he was moving up in the world, marrying the daughter of a well-known New York editor of Sussan Scott. His authors included James commissioner, Barbara talking. Joseph Alex was in dad to another world. And I saw something changing when I thought it was extremely fun when we had talks in smoke cigarettes and drink, it's scotch with a cessol. Sessol was an editor at McMillan and his authors and the people he was involved with work were best selling authors and very in a literary world they were they were the top people and so I think dad was. I was so impressed with that and wanted to impress Cecil. And let him know, let Cecil know that, hey, , your daughter's Mary, a heck from Illinois, or Oklahoma, I mean, it's got some worth and I think that's really what he was trying to do. It was pretty something about himself. A re-inventing stuff. He was always inventing the Cecil. Here he was going through a stage now where he could come up to Chappaclain and know how to dress and do. Do what the Methodists were doing and when we... go up for the weekends I thought, my God, what is this is so not me, this is so not my dad, this whole suburban trip. I mean, it was just not, it was so strange. I thought I saw a dad playing a role. The record, my mom didn't have any of these pretensions. She was used to the squirrel. She was a painter, an artist, and her own life. For the first five years of her marriage, I'm in danger. that lived happily on the upper west side of New York City. That's where my older brother Scott was born. It's been a long time since I was 1969 to 1972. The Ice Storm. I was born and the parents decided it was time to move to the suburbs, so they could raise their kids in the stable environment with a nice small town. As it turned out, this was the place our livestock pole. The big old house of the town and ours could be from New York. To find out more about this period, I visited Alan, the end of the child from the father's first marriage. He lived in Dus and Katana for over a year, now is in the woods of New Hampshire. He lives  the ex-heppy years. He enjoys singing along to the guitar, talks freely about sex, makes a living as a computer programmer. Alan was 17 during the year he lived in Dus. He'd moved out from San Diego to finish high school in his father. It was just great. , it was just great to me. Wonderful. Placed with a world as I could Smoke and drink and , be adults and sophisticated and all those things. They had some really different, , they were all just probably as you can put some and take that up into F***ing up. For a couple of years in Katana, all of my dad's kids intersect at various times. The side down on Becky and Shelley, also from the first marriage lived every free of the high spot. And Josie from the second marriage came up from the city of the Stanley. The shortly after moving to Katona, Tableta was next transformation. Radical left turn away from the suburban stagionist he had chosen. The year was 1969. Here's how my dad described it. I was trying I was pointing to out the other way. I'd  it to three Marching, you want to see the top. I'd  to question. The wire street. Kids had long hair. More over-all. And I looked at me. The time was the end. When I got there. Heee. made it very clear to me that he was not going to be my father, he was going to be my buddy. I mean, I mean, I would ask me where are you going or how long you're going to be, where have you been and what were you doing and that sort of thing? , if he asked me anything and I told him, and it was anything to least, it's better to be a little bit racier off beat or anything  that. He was just  to definitely drink that drink. Yeah, the more I did, the more grady thought it was. That was a very tumultuous time, not only because Alan was there really, but because of all the changes that was going through and he was beginning to get into drugs. This is Josie. Meaning, he's smoking marijuana. They were both taking LSD and also mescalone. So all of this was going on where Alan was. And I was kind of involved and I was even involved. I'd go up there every other week and sometimes smoke and a very young age. And I absolutely incredible to be now that I did this and all these people coming in and out of that house. The narrower adults were trying to continue to, that quit his job and consider themselves the guru to the resident teenagers. I'm the girlfriend Stephanie. Here's our own dance. I was still smoking and doing this. So, okay, I was finally with him. He was really enjoying this really delivering life's downings. , I think he felt that I was  out doing him somehow in terms of my liberatedness. And he was  in competition with me to see who could be the wildest or something. In fact, he kind of  came down on my level a lot. I don't know if I ever told you this. but he  came on to Stephanie one time. And he offered to take her home when I was  two stoned her drunkers and she gave you. And he drove her home and  a tractor, I'm going home, pulled over, started sticking his tongue down or throw. This, my girlfriend. 17, 18 year old girl. That really pissed off. So, let's try it off and see what anything to do with our family. I would really love it. I was so angry. Did you think of something? No. I couldn't have so frightened of him. I didn't see this anger. , Sally, but that time he was starting to think, feel  Sally was dragging him down or something or kind of no stover around his neck and turns his liver rated necessarily something  that. And he was just blow off a drop of half of that. I remember just think they said he'd be down and we'll die you through the tunnel there. one morning and for some reason he don't  the way she cooked the egg there's something and something she said, said to him, and he just threw his plate and he's the law and then he threw the table against the other law and just started ripping up the tini-room taking pictures off the laws smashing them over chairs and smashing chairs and splatters. And Sally was just screaming and covering her quarter of her room. I was , I've never been so petrified in a little light. I was doing that same. And then an hour later it was over. And then I was , we were all supposed to pretend  nothing happened. Oh, he'd put up a member just, , whenever whenever I was with values or maybe I now adopt him, he'd slap me around, , really throw me across the room, there's chosen again. And really, that was quite a distance. I mean, I was pretty skinny kid, but he would just unleash his wraith on me. And I, that I do remember one time that I did prevent him from really... I know that I was going to be harmed terribly because I stood up for myself and what I did was I screamed help and police and Please came next to our neighbor came and and then and then it continued and it just continued and stop This is my brother Scott who is probably four years old at this time one of my earliest memories Tona so waking up and In short The green dust there's the same guy in the animal but the beast comes there. As our city minister says, mom, she's helping me. He apparently just shows you can see me. He's similar to me. He's , this bleeding, the police were there, , trying to come down. It seemed to me  there was kind of a very lucky amount. During that time of this fight with the neighbors. blood is rushing down and staining his white suit. And that was just such an image to see dad, he, , dad was getting hit. Please for coming. And I maybe I did feel a little empowered who knew that word in that term. But then when I walked into the bathroom seeing him wash his white clothing, , to get the stain out. And he looked up at me and he said, I don't want to know you, I don't want anything to do. you and you're on the next train and that was that. I think you get overwhelmed by his emotions. That somehow he felt his emotions and when he had an emotion he had to feel it fully. And if it meant  smashing his foot to a door. or beating up his wife. And he almost felt that to censure that was to censure his own creativity. And I think that he was of a generation that might have glamorized that, to certain extent. I think that the artists of his generation that he admired, , can we know where Jackson Power people that get... many ways that sort of emulated these types. I think there are, , these are tremendously successful individuals, but they also live life on the edge. And I think there was sort of a cult of that, of an appeal to that. I think that is a separate goal too. In a sense, who else would embody some of the different cultural trends and how it is for the audience, other than someone who gives in to all those emotions. It's in quality. made him so charismatic and engaging. It means to create doubts and thoughts. I also made him tear. I was alive during the Mayhem in Katona, but it all happened before I was three years old. So I don't remember anything. To Josie, I was very much a part of Katona. I felt ashamed because there were some bad things going on where the princess of your parents had to come home from. a part of you or something, or just smoking marijuana and listening to music and involved in their own lives or whatever their discussions and you'd be, I'd be going upstairs and I'd be checking on you and, or I'd hear you crying and I'd hear you crying and crying and crying and knowing would come to see you and there you'd be in the crib. I guess I was ashamed because I felt  I turned on back on this movie. I that pain was, I to Katownan when I had a big blow up with me, dad. I felt  I never saw you get in the field, I didn't want it, I didn't want it. Because it's just a kindered of so many horrible images. This was completely new. When I sat down to interview Joseph in the very new tunnel, I'd always heard the stories about this crazy period and that actually lived in the house I grew up in. But I never thought of myself as a part of him. And when Joseph first mentioned that I crossed it off. Then one afternoon after the went for hiking the mountains, she came to my room and said, she started to cry from the end of the sky. She felt so guilty when she was so neglected and for abandoned things. Now I heard her. But I felt  she was talking to her own person. I wasn't going to buy that stuff I said. That wasn't me, it was just a baby I don't want to lay my life. And I pointed out that she was just a kid herself, which was nothing to be guilty about. She didn't realize everything she stole it were what she did. that was when he was not being crazy. And Mama was scratching the corner and she was shaking up and crying. It didn't hurt me that I was caught up on the chaos. I was starting to realize the story of a story that you taught couldn't be the same when I had started out to do. I was feeling different than that now. I was beginning to have a hard time to send in what I was pursuing the students. Risk damages levels.

After my parents divorced, staff was still doing a lot of drugs and capable of holding onto a job, a girlfriend. She was working as a professional actor, which many was mostly broke. She was on the guiding right for a couple of years, playing a newful Texas lawyer and a ramen chief. But when we were out with him, we were going to stop him in the street and ask him for his autograph. He thought that was pretty cool. Batman! What's wrong? Not Dick, not now! Time for Robin and Batman! What? Dap wrote in the act of the part of that man when the series of records about the Capes were said, this one's called, if music be the fruit of death. To me and my brother, he was the supreme. I was seven years old. I have to prove to him that he was a letter that answers the little. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. When we saw him on the weekends, he was at his best. I kind of found him. What the hell? What the other one?

No one had any idea where he was. I find the family we need to met. It turns out that he was in the park where I thought, didn't know if he'd want anything to do with the family because my dad practically disowned him. He was as excited to me to die once. Harry? Yes. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry to do this. Hi. Good. You're both pretty nervous. Yeah. So you're moving? No. Sorry to do it, let's go. I think I'll go on the video. Here you go. As far as I'm concerned, there's a huge family of some months. He's exactly the same old hairline and stick out ears of my dad had. He looks a lot  my dad actually. Harry's 22 years old is smart and funny. He's an instant uncomfortable company. Harry was born during the mid-70s and the mid-Sodats on Stable Life from New York. That dated Harry's mom for a few months. pregnant that rejected her. She moved to a common intensity called the farm where her and grew up. That almost saw her a handful of times. And her is few memories of that took place most in ten of the ten years after you've spawned. I guess I have three or four memories that people might have been over the course of two trips. This is when you wrote in a condo and setting out for you. I don't think he was attached at the time. He was living such a... such a . Early 90s Microwave life is the only way to put it it was it was one of the pop-up kind of medium strips In seven California which are  just  wildfire across seven California I mean I would go there and we go to the Go to grocery store and buy  three frozen pizzas and come back and microwave I mean he lived this total microwave existence and Mean everything that a slice is  just pop and about kind of raining So we're at this apartment and I guess I was back in the game with a little hand back and I was still serving the process of moving into this place and I bumped it back so the lamp was on and the lamp fell and it didn't work. And so I just got hair and oil and I was oh my gosh I forgot broke this lamp and so I didn't want to not tell it might, , smart thing to do with it would be in a tunnel but  my conscience forced me to go in there and I said up. I broke the lamp, , it's not working. You went in there, he tried to turn it on and didn't work and he just exploded. He just freaked out. He just started  carrying a part. His office, he  dropped the lamp on the ground and he was just dorming and standing there screaming out the room and things on the ground, just building his papers all over the place, sweeping things, just  a maniac. He finally just calmed down and then he took the lamp and he checked the bulb and the bulb had broken and he changed the bulb and the lamp worked. So that's what we just cleaned up the room and he was apologizing and he said, , man, why did I do this? Even if this lamp had been broken, you guys ten times more trouble with the Yeah, obviously he was This I guess he was struggling with a lot of things and don't think how to do the lamp On another trip Harris's dad was reading newspaper about the pan and flight that went down over lock of the Scotland Never wanted to hold him back that started crying about the victims Not when you think  what he Where did can you think skies were real Who's heching Baoys people and last I remember feeling he was almost , I don't know if he was doing this better remember almost feeling bad , gee why am I not more broken up about this and wanting to feel more upset about it. But then he went right out of being upset about that to just laying straight into me about me about  existing career he was  . I don't want you up here, , your mom is just sticking you in my life. , I didn't ask for you to come visit. , when you start going in all these things, I never even wanted you. You were just a manipulation that your mom used to trying to get to me. And , he... He was just railing at me. I'm never hearing so... So, wordless, so insecure, so unhappy and just scared and depressed. I remember it was around that time when I was , it may have been around that time, but it was experiences  that that made me think, I don't know why it would have been to have to have had. actually ever spent any period of my life being raised by his person. I could not imagine what he would be  to have to go home from school. I know that he was going to be there and I thought I could not have handled it. I would have broken, I would have absolutely broken. I remember feeling so grateful, so grateful that I had not been raised by him at all because I didn't feel I never felt  let down a key had not raised me in all of it. They never call me, I, , did honest truth with what I thought was, why is he even coming along now, making it harder. Growing up the furthest from that, having the least contact in many of us, very is also the least conflicted law in the siblings. Me, I'm not nearer to settle. 97.9.98. We born again. Around the time that Ronald Reagan's a carfice in the Royal Majority Kingdom, sway around the country, my father became Christian. That this beginning will appear that my wife is going to laugh nothing, that they are legal. And now, I have to do what I'm trying to do is hurt people, people who love them. That I'm trying to show them what I'm so scared. All of the authors of my artist's house, I'm trying to show them what I'm trying to do. I got some tests making me nervous and had her and I was usually stormed to a little man. In the late 70s, shortly after Harry was born, when my dad's girlfriends began dragging to meetings and he eventually searched. I'm out of the technical post for so many years is beginning to open. I'm out of my heart, yes, no. I've changed as an apprentice of believing. I love so deeply. My father was saved, going again. ... We moved to California and briefly lived his life-honged dream of doing his own thing. We traveled around Southern California at performing this Christian place. At the end of each performance, that would stand up and preach, calling people up front to be saved, laying his hands in the pendant. Scott started thinking down as a weird outmovey. You could see that down was a progressive and self-obsessed as he'd ever been. And now, it was all in the service of Jesus. We're driving out to the desert. That was something to come. And back. I was in front of you and back, around a way that Palm Springs. And that was speaking in Palm Springs sound , I was in the middle of the hall and I was in the middle of the hall. I was in the middle of the hall and I was in the middle of the hall. And I remember I said, So, dad, what is that? What is that chanting you do? And I said, is that some ancient Hebrew, Are you praying in the city? Interesting, you ask? I don't know what it is, but it's an ancient dead tongue, but he said, I received a Holy Spirit. When you receive a Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit speaks to you. And he said, well, it's very interesting. And he asked, well, I would  to speak in tongues. And I said, well, alright, I guess, , totally worried. And then he put his hands on my head. And he started to speak, , he started to speak in tongues and he said, have no father. That the Holy Spirit comes to God with me. And it is whole prayer. And then he said, okay, , this is why he's driving to a run, you just stay. That's it. So don't kiss that. Don't you speak in tongues. Don't totally self-conscious. I look at you, you are just absolutely,  cracking up, , silently. And I kept having him hoeing and said, come ahead, don't be afraid. And then I started to speak this language, you and I had made up, you're , is , we're back in the loop, we should have looked at it. I just made up this language. And you were practically dying in the back seat. And he was, supporting him oh it's good yeah he's going you're going then then once the grandpa all through which and then he started doing it again with grandpa all all through which and it wasn't funny anymore this and then grandpa all through a chapter he was so afraid he actually went some bathroom his pants maybe deal with it and that just got furious and then just thinking oh it's a cruel man At some point, most of my brothers and sisters went through phase being dad's favorite, and then they'd see through him or he'd turn on them. There was always a confrontation, and it ended. My fathers, too, young as children, Sarah and Grace never confronted them  this when he was a lot. They were too little. So they're stuck trying to figure out what to make of them now, five years after his death. I just saw him as two different people. , there was a guy who beat my mom with a nurse guy's spritz. I don't know, it just seems so typical and it just seems so... That's all I know, that's all I've ever known and that's all I know is a father kind of thing. Sarah's dad's second youngest. She just turned 18. There from this marriage to marrying the 1980s. We grew up mostly in Colorado. Sarah was just a baby when I built with dad and just  Josie Fuffieldy for a band. She's up guilty for a band. and me's baby. I've always had a nagging girlfriend with a certain grace bond. Yeah, I remember working that. He was alive. And that's because I never really saw the side that everyone seems to hate about him. , he always loved me a lot. He was still needed. That was daddy's screw. It made so much sense for Sarah. We can flirt about that. I saw so much of me. in her. I had also been daddy's girl and I remember the weekend I felt a transfer to her. One weekend after I was used to see my father for a long time and it clearly started my independence from him. In that weekend that part all was emotional. I'd say manipulation and gender. I remember the tragedy that Scott and I remember the story we can move at the same when possible, animal lives as human. I remember that You were the last beautiful girl. And you were just starting to gain more of the way. Not a lot. A little. And we were going to eat and dad kept giving him all the stuff that flew to him. And I'm always saying to him, that I am not supposed to eat that. I'm supposed to be in the diet. And you said to you, Sarah, I love you. And I'm anyone who's... tells you you can't eat whatever you want. Doesn't love him. I think you should eat absolutely anything. You can't tell me what you want. Do you remember? Mmm. Because you remember my mom told me that we had when I came back for the first. I got the distinct feeling that he wanted you to eat as much as you can eat. Oh my gosh. So I would love more or Spectamore? I don't know. I swear with you, I'm worried. So that kid. Kind of a little school's been the answer. I think, and this is, , I'm just... I'm just actually... But... And... could be wrong, but I think that, it also sets me in that trip. Sarah's gonna be the kitten stays with me. We all know, so it's lovely, Sarah's super, so it's gonna stay with me. And that combined with this comment on me, eating as much as you want, really needing thank you for just making a mistake. While my older brothers and sisters have gone farther and working out their dreams about my father and in the process of distancing themselves, partially rejecting Sarah said I can't, not yet anyway. And one thing I remember about my dad saying he was taking pictures of me one day and I still have the pictures. I look at him now, I had a bad firm,  my bad glasses and there was a time I was getting really hefty and I was just getting really hefty and I was just wearing sweats, but I remember specifically when he was taking these pictures, he was , extremely beautiful, girl series,  you can grow up, , take pictures  this for living and stuff  that. And no one else said that about me at that time. No one else said that to me. And , it apparently meant a lot to me because it's one of the things I remember now. No, it's  that, he knew. Then you knew I was gonna be okay. And I guess things  that have always been slightly comforting to me now. If you have a parent  my father, somebody can be so seductive and he wants to be. And so a rational and violent other times, spend a long time after they're gone, trying to make sense of it all. Only race, we have those kinds of views. I'm just because I didn't know what I'm going to talk to. And I don't even know how to tell people if they ask me about my problem. , where's her or what I was saying? I mean, Grace has a pretty, right now she has a pretty good idea of the way she feels. She was not supposed to be. She's angry. She was a certain cent. I sat and then I'm so indifferent. I can't understand whatever she likes. the prince's voice. The egg group. Don't listen to my eyes. It's just not here. I mean, I do care, but it's just so... I don't. I was lucky enough that it happened really enough to my wife. It's not. And I'm back. I don't have... I don't know. really did. Right now that's the way I've conditioned myself to thank you. By the time I left Sarah, I no longer saw my dad as someone who became a different person with an ancient life in each new decade. Sarah said he was all too familiar, I heard him felt all of this before. Looking through the eyes of all my siblings, I saw my brothers in person and different costumes and so on. It was essentially the same. me. I think my father created mythology rather than real life for himself. The series of mythologies, American mythologies, the torture of artist, the rising Hollywood star, the beat playwright, and Manhattan Little Rare type, the acid dropping hippie, the 70s hiddenist, the conservative Gorgang, the wandering missionary. Every phase was a new way of mythologizing yourself. Follow my talk about my dad. following his dreams, I think his dreams weren't even his own. Second hand dreams are from American poppers of culture. As it changed so far, seemed that he couldn't separate the fantasy of his public myths from real life. And his most personal interactions would be comedy, songs, and refund out, and remellar instead of key ballbridge. In most standard biographies, people change and grow. They face challenges and got through heroic changes. What happens to the people who get stuck making the same mistakes over and over? Prove the surface changes in this life. My father sent me to put himself in the same situation again and again. Here he is writing March 26, 1993, and it's just before you graduate from Boulder. This is Dear Scott, and finally brought to a dead stop, Carl Rooken down for the second time into the trip in time. got my stuff in California. Scott wrote me a letter that wrote in the term the last period in his life just a few months before he died, or after he married his fifth wife, surely. And of course I would  for you to know surely. The main problem I have had with others is that in very early, after a beginning which implies, they are sympathetic with my artistic goals, they expect me to give up those goals and vote myself, to building some kind of material estate. But they have actively sought society. I'm aware it will seem odd to you and others who have suffered from some degree of not support from me. But to me the story of my life in quotes is one of repeatedly setting side of my work. To meet the needs of wise and children. Interesting. Hmm Hmmm.... The amazing to me that I am, finds all of them. these ways to justify himself continually. His whole interpretation of the problems in his life is being somehow him compromising himself with his wives and children. He's essentially explaining him for his inability to be a great artist, which I think is just a bunch of crap. My father died in July of 1993. He just started the other theater company and married his fifth wife. His relationships involved his children were strange and distant. I'm Keith Aldridge. Man's second child for a son. Thank you for coming. That and I had in common a... ...nerved. to strike out and wander and do things differently, sometimes in a run-in-project way. This is my father speaking at his father's memorial service. The way my father talks about his father, I think is pretty much the way he'd want to remember. The way he'd want me to use his hand, from radio. He was a heartbroken man. He was a loving man. He was in his pain. He often struck out him. He was a loving man. was irritated, it was only up to the pain. He was so close to the Lord and he was so contrite over the error of his ways. And he endured so much scarred and contempt and disprovable for people who he loved so much and I too. Share that with my new, what that felt , and the endured it was the lovingest song, Richard Love. I hope you're taught a way. I'm in the suits, more. Nolast few months, meeting with all of my father's children, I've come to know two things for sure. One is that in his own way, he did love each of us. The others. that. None of his children could be a rejoicing the way you would want. None of us see him wait for saw himself. Julia, I'm trying to explain to you.
