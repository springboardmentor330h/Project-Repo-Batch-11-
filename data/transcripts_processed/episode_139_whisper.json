I had of us 14 months pondering the choice of presidential candidates seems to excite nobody if you have me. And it goes once again. All of us are left in a position where we want to feel inspired we want to believe in something. And nobody is showing up to do the job. And I find myself thinking about a candidate that made during the last presidential election. This wasn't anybody who made it big. See them in total! his name is Chuck Boy saw, he was a retired professor of electronic engineering, running for office is a Republican, and he mostly democratic district V San Jose. A man in at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, standing in the afternoon son, wearing a red, white and blue by Centennial tie. He had never run for office before this. And talking to him? You could tell. Me, he was so much more emotionally present than any normal political candidate you need. He went to the eye, he asked him a question, he actually answered it. And he had done that robotic, not quite human, hot people after so many condiments in the pebble. I retired senior pistachia to run for us. So I could have been secure in academia, right? As a human artist. Why are you doing this? I love my country. What I come from a really humble background and my country as well as it has given me opportunity opportunity. that all I have to do is take advantage of the son of a whole mind. Are you somebody who's always wanted to run across those twey within the vacuum mind? No. When did the idea it came to your mind? Well, I had a family meeting with God in this son, your girl, college, just get off on your own. My wife and I got together and I just, I just make it that way. I look  I might want to take a notice of that. So my and Dar says why do you run for? And says you're gonna be kidding. And I said,  what is involved with the meat broth? , much  eating along hours. Better, better, better. Then all of the sudden my daughter come up with this says, and this is the term of mine. She says, this is all from you. We love it. If not you, and that's what you do. And that's what you do. you decide it. Yeah. You're spending $60,000 for some retirement money to do this. And  a lot of people I met a do a public convention, but was most striking about truck voice of this, this idea was simply sincere that wasn't extremely. This is the possible of the American political system. It's filled with lots of profoundly idling, working with all them. And yet, it does not seem to produce items to candidates. I mean, was it must inspire anything to represent our voice? Or George Bush Jr., or was it dull? But today on our radio program, as we head into another election season, keeps off from feeling disperated by the stage media events, negative ads, the issues involved in our retested oak ужеwh Prophecy Pacific Cooperốc RE Tool Music bring you stories of a little idealess. Stories to make us all feel some small sense of hope about politics in America. All of these stories taken from watching coverage we did four years ago during this American line. WB EZ Chicago, public rating with international on my request. I'm at one of our show today, upside down world. We have a campaign diary from Michael Lewis for four years ago about a politician you'll be hearing a lot about in the next few weeks and months. And the story of a moment when the opposite normal politics became normal politics. Back to, isn't tell. A Walter Mondale voting gave rights supporting unrepentant liberal signs up as a Republican party member. It ends up a party functionary, a delegate of the state Republican convention, where it can wreak havoc, a degree, heat and repeat. Back to the Republican governor, heat Wilson's ant. immigrant policies found some supporters among immigrants themselves. We hear an explanation of the profoundly idealistic notion of self-deportation, at four, throwing money at the problem. You may recall a best-selling book from a few years ago called, there are no children here. And that two boys growing up in Chicago's new Re-Corner Public Housing Projects. With those projects were across the street in the site of the 1996 Democratic Convention of Chicago'mod ос can they use the unknown? and how the real-enfranchised in the neighborhood. One of the kids from the book now grown up, gave us a tour, showing us what got fixed up, and how the real-enfranchised in the neighborhood all happened beneath the normal political radar. Stay with us. At one, I've sat down below. We're beginning to welcome the story of national politics as it is almost never practice. Michael Willis, his campaign diaries from the U.S. presidential race, was some of the most evocative and original reporting anybody did. His stories were not listed, often great funny. This next story, which was first published in the New Republic vaccine, put Arizona Senator John McCain on the map for a lot of people in the way that he had never been before. It coincided with and it boosted the rise to national notoriety from the King, who, of course, has now become a Republican presidential candidate himself. Nice böl, peace night is the special. April the 19th. I leave my hotel earlier than I need to. Walk down from the Washington Line, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Even at 730 in the morning, the Mall is nearly deserted, the Lincoln Memorial. And Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the other hand is teaming with people who appear to have been up for hours, walking slowly along the link for the Black Marvel Slap, Barry, and names of the dead. The next 20 minutes I sit on a bench, dodging bird drop. waiting for Senator John McCain who is agreed to meet in here. In my attempts to spot him in the distance, we can't help but notice how different ordinary people behave from politicians. Maybe 50  he candidates passed through my line of vision and not one of them passed for a US senator at 100 pesos. They comb their hair in public, scratch himself, hold him. And they don't the fuck. The king appears at my side, for a very sanitary ons that prepare about rages they want, what, a via your sunglasses. Some undignified name, hobby, hippo, stenciled on the earpiece. McCain is the dull-sert, most in demand, the speaker around the country, and it's not hard to see what. What matters most, people who wish to see McCain speak for dull, is the formative experience that the two senators have since share. Move nearly the… inside in a war. Both endured indescribable pain and suffering. Those were dealers of the center of his national campaign. Some extent it is. This campaign. McCain's trials are less than 0. October 26, 1967. He ejected out of his navy jet and into a north-beaten means bomb. McCain suffered two broken arms, shattered into shoulders. Bad net wounds as anchored and drawn. 29th atomicUMverage briefing 25…. I can get a saw, he picks a cane, he wants later, and his first prison cell. The cane weight less than 100 pound arms, his hair, collected, graze and ties, was nearly snow white. Pots of food, ponded with his face, neck, hair and beer. His cheeks were sunk, his neck chicken one, his legs, neck. McCain survived the captivity without medical treatment in the next five years. During torture so it's good, demons read about it called a sweat. out on your ground. These captors were hanging on the broken arms, from dangles ropes, from hours on hand, from the rest of them. But the astonishing part of the Kings experience was its voluntary atmosphere. McCain is the very generation of the distinguished military family. The father was an admiral of turning the hit on more. Nor feared me as hoping the famous prisoner of war would violate the U.S. military policy, was dictated to prisoners be returned in order they are armed. If he accepted their offer of freedom, and came with test of life, the Royalization and their confrits. For five and a half years, his captors tried to torture him to go in home. For five and a half years, he refused to go. He walked alongside Black Planet Slab against the Art Company trap that back. The park service says that the memorial has become the second most frequently visited site shirt. after the Capitol. The McCain admits that the first he found it to press and even faintly antagonists. But one day he was passing through on his own. He visits off in the ring cell and discovered a couple of veterans running their hands across the described names. Fearless the two-minute never met him. But they had fallen in conversation, swapped worst words. In a few minutes, we're clutching you to her and weeping. If that kind of healing goes on, it says McCain. Well, and it's a good thing. Someone once said, the next one, the nation's going to be in line from his reps, there's a feeling about me came, one that seems Latin and dull, that he is somehow explained, his own experience, came so. He is assimilated, his common difference, his candidate, his common. He says, this is the McCain theory and I think it's valor. I was in the dull shadow shot there, 31 years old. I had a whole line. He was... I believe that everything Bob Bell has done since the world was dicked by that experience. The Vietnam veteran achieved the kind of equipment that is supposed to be deserved, only for veterans and good persons. When Clinton arrived for White House services, the king sent him a note saying any time the president wished to walk in into the Vietnam's the center of the map. The center of the map was out of the Vietnam to walk alongside. Clinton said back in ice now. Recalling this exchange costs the key to break his written.

Back in the mid-A, the guy who protested the war came into my office. He said his name was David Isher. December 1997. David Isher. A group of Americans. he just had no one. Where he delivered an anti-war radio address for American soldiers engaged in tax and will be adopted. By God or Indian Jairking Prof. Anna, this program was piping, a prison cell, from six in the morning, the line is not. But McCain, in January anger and heart, shows not the famous crisis was in. He explains, if she stood in my office and he says, I came here to tell you, I made it best a day. I was wrong and I'm sorry and I said to him look I accept your apology will be friends but more importantly I want you to go on with your life it cannot look bad. Here he pauses and I figure he's finished but he's grumpy behind his aviator sign glasses and a point in his hand that forgiveness is ultimately less self-destructed than the better desire for revenge. perhaps there is no such thing. Five months ago David Diff should be diagnosed with cancer. The cancer is proved or treatable and it's spread rapidly. David Diff should not die. He's 47 years old and has a wife and three-year-old child. He says, okay, when I heard about it, did pass through my mind. Suppose I had told David Diff, get the power out of my office.

Twenty years later, when Clinton ran for the president, if she didn't be in General Counsel in this campaign. Before he accepted the job power, he pulled him in a pact for his war veteran. He's time is joined in the presidential campaign. He says, I brought it up with Clinton deliverment. He said he knew what I'd done and he even harder. And then he still admired it now. These days Clinton calls it in two or three times each week, and when he's proud of it. A few months ago, the issue in France spent the night in Lincoln, bedroom. And the pictures of Clinton playing with the issue in trouble, the presence of the good pal sees almost a scene besides the issue in his lawn face. Yet, when I called him, David issue, he asked me to ask him in case he says, I'm very proud of this story. And it's never been written. I asked him about his feelings towards him, he says, one of our true political heroes, he's a giant. Ifshins version of their story differs from the kings and its important details and its spirit. When the king fells him, ifshins in the era, he decided he made a mistake and bravely to postposability for his actions. The way ifshins fells him, he came in here. If I listen to him, I realize this is a real real. First of the usual Washington investigation, which the reporter visits each and customer party, collected dirt on the atmosphere.

Then he asked me to stop by his office, which I did. And normally wouldn't. He was blinded, fader, told me that. I said, I owed you an apology. He robbed me of the chance to make. He is characteristic of the modest and humble man. Later that year, understand? Together with the Vietnamese immigrant, they've built that fort. The established institute for democracy and Vietnam. Fishing just painfully in this chair, the stops to catch the breath. It was at the Vietnam's veteran memorial that what he calls the second half of the story in the cave began. On Memorial Day of 1993, Bill Clinton spoke inside. He said he could be the first woman who got stuck on the cabin and we had to wear a second cigarette and brain, but that wasn't an essential use of getting kills, with a really proper love and pain. If she were loudly, who was also happy. And one of the hackers weighed the sign and said, tell us about ifsh. Four weeks later, ifsh found himself on a flight to Washington with McKay, who motioned him to take the seat beside. Ifsh says, he asked why I hadn't taken a job in the administration. I said this in that. We played 20 questions until Pineram said, it's because that stupid sign is, and I said, yes, what? He said, come to my office to law-money and we'll settle this thing once and for all.

The veterans, the King Row, were very impressed by the committee. certain termination offered telecom-tribute to their service, but it would have been far easier for them to avoid a advantage of all from government. We came to cry to behavior of the protestors. Then we moved on. Among the demonstrators that day, one individual held a sign in jazz and present to explain to association with a person known to many of our colleagues, Mr. David Isher. Tell us about Isher, Fred. My other purpose is speaking today is the duty. just that. I want to talk about David Isher. David Isher is my friend. The separation becomes a shock.

The dog camp pain, everywhere you went with the dog train senators, government come out of the woodwork, and they wanted to have the patient take and show some word all the rest. I told the final day, and they all cleared out. The senators and governors were traveling. It was one person out at a side. John McCain. I was in Rustic Hand, the dog camp being in the river rooms. I noticed that I saw a cane kind of off from outside. I didn't even go all day. And I went up to talk and he said to me, almost apologetic, he said, , I would be here if I thought you were in the end. And I knew that. And he was there because because he knew that he was the old's time of need and it's time for someone to step up. This is which I'll curious about. I think he continually, as I covered this campaign, who was near the politics right now, is to be never written about. Come down to the main screen. sort of restored my faith in the process of getting into it. It was something about his... How should I put it? It was his willingness to stick his neck out for losing or not popular calls. That was so different from most of the people to where he does. So, so different from the ordinary political aspect. That was repression. And it inspired. Cops were there. Altar. juice. M amen. So if canal Manila a Lewis, this campaign diary from the 1996 race collected in the book Trail of Bieber, John McCain's now running for the Republican presidential nomination.

Now this story, a political idealism, political activists, and witness. Hello, my name is Dan Savage and I am the Republican Party. I am the Republican Precinct Community Office Service now for a pre-seeking 4-6-4-3 district in Seattle, Washington. If you have any questions about the Republican Party, report form for any of our candidates, feel free to give me a call. Now, should point out here that Dan Savage is not just the Republican Precinct Service, just with gay sex pounds. Now you're probably wondering how a common thing to drag back sexy boys to columnists found a home in 800 day fashion Neo fascists from a party. Let me tell you something about the Republican Party is a big tip. Huge. We know how to watch the litmus tests from public and party caucuses. We've been mentioned by attended. I didn't have to use voter registration order. I'd  to write a e-book to my very first caucus. A measure I believe in respect. The Republican Party has some rights in the U.S. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line, and I'm savage, certain bars, and he's sheep, and there's a huge number of people in public. And that's who knew going over the dark side to be so simple. Okay, here's the second show. The answer to that is that it's just at the only way to change a little party that now it's really good also. First show enchanical about it, dear. He is the sign-up of the children. So he shared up at his local Republican office, which included her, it says, small group of the public members, the big group of the public. And at this point, he's straight to the surprise, he heard. Once he arrived, he found out that because he was the only person who was a little precinct, he was a public person. He was a public person. He was the reason he was our mayor, we sing the ox. then automatic once at the time. Well, he wrote it to the experience that he had at the time. And the most damning, partisan term, humanly possible, they published it. Bye. Is that true? A couple of weeks after I traveled over to Darkside, Daniel Meetsmith, chairman of the 40-term Republican Party, well, he was a loter. I think he'll be surprised that the hate-mongering game. bashing Neo-Fascist public and party does not exist in the pre-third Smith Road. I invite you to come to one of our meetings and see for yourself. So I went to one of Smith's meetings to see myself. 40-third district Republican Congress. I arrived at the Montenegro Community Center for 1996 for the Pertes Republican Congress's ADM. I paid my $5 signed in, grabbed a seat, and waited for the work to be done. We were there to allow That delegates to the state could probably be convention coming up before the day we get, and vote a non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with prayer, we asked God to guide us and select the delegates, and then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. The only trouble was no one brought up for it. I thought about suggesting that the agents to the flag made that to me, but I didn't want to interrupt them. Someone found some red, white, and blue buttons back and lost it over an easy one new pledge allegiance to that. The diesel was needed post-pladged so the red button. We had to elect delegates before we could get resolutions. They will board even problems, rules, or stuff, and possible conflict process. But the 80 of us in Cranth, steeplegroup, aggressive in rural,  in 17 delegates in the state room of the community. Suffice to say it was crashing, no. To entertain us while we waited. and valid state-party four times, for public and party activists and candidates game speeches. Some of these speeches were pure fantasy. One woman read a prepared speech about the United Nations working in constant proportions to take over the country. The other recurring fantasy had to do with us, 43 district Republicans, retaking the 43 Republican Party. One man reminisced about the time that long ago, when the 43rd solidly republished street. We can make this district Republican, again, just  it was. So when I joined the party 25 years ago, all we have to do is get out there and doorbell and identify the voters in a district for sympathetic to her issues. Park pounding. To any of you that out of the house walked out of Broadway and left the evening, where I have to stand and be looking around at the top of the screen. 40 for district, and it gone all yellow on this. So long as the Republican party was identified for public folks and I gave big enough this Republican I'm not looking party contested for you. She's a big bot. When I sat down, I knew what it was  when I went out with the cheating. Very good. In other words, she and by extension the party was not homophobic. And I was wrong. She said to me, party is against hate. Let's just fall asleep, pressure. Gee, I wonder where I picked up that false version. Maybe from Jesse Helms from the morning, but I was known to the whole, yet to- Redspray, Repolarityale, and NetRumb fellow clone remarks. This isных work with F coriander first. learned sailing During a break, an attractive mid-stage man approached. He was a little angry. I was offended by you forcing me to take responsibility for Jesse Hells. As if the Republican Party isn't responsible for Jason's news. One woman wanted to know why she should support gay people since gay people since or her when her home was spread down by her sisters. The arsonist were gay or anything where were gay people when she was. Another point out, some games broke into Windows, and I'm not going to have to go to the second place. So who's the person who? Another man to be a side to repraved, let me know that the game actually, then we're probably going to have to run into a real world. It was only to get out the world to motivate the front lines. Well, then I guess that means okay, I'm happy to be vilified and scapegoated, vibe my civil rights, so long as it motivates people to go to the police. This one franchise is a small price of the paper. To surprise at this meeting, Dan Savage talked the caucusable approving a resolution that affirmed the rights of gay's Muslims and rejected, tell him it's already a little spoiled fear and hatred for such a short, political man. He could not wait. I have a great experience getting to talk to Dan. As an official delegate Dan Savage, we have a vote there to be  amendments to really be , well, he planned to vote in the struggles that he did. for the most conservative republic, it's a space-pappy-transfer president for the governor of Washington State, but passed well. Proposes gun control and gay rights, all egg loads. It's how it just thinking is that the more extreme the republican tech would end up being, the more likely they would lose general election. And the more likely that the party would eventually abandon this one suit. A few weeks later, the big error on. King County Republican Convention, my first major party function, adds speeches to the mentions. I founded out of bed at 7am, who ran to meet my new friend Steve at QFC and Broadway. Steve attended his precinct offices way back in March, we intentionally ended up in the delegate of the county state.

Please forgive our leaders for endorsing perversion and God deliver us from the Spineless Poppipes. Then we bell out for pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States. I slipped up to the merchandise stamp, so I'm sorry. So, Red White and Blue Press will forget, it must have been fate. They way back down, we're doing those tables. I ran SmackDown to an ill-impressed room. They said, hello, looking very serious. I'm a little bit late for that task. What are we going to do about the problem of such problems as well? What is the final solution to the long-sense sexual nonsense? So long as they stay inside, we can let them alone, unless we're finding them in. When they organize, man's special rights. must pose.

The King County Republican platform, the doctor, the president of the parking can leave the lays out to the King County Republican party stands. And here's the beautiful part. Delegates are allowed to propose. Mendes wants an amendment to propose the amendment sponsored, just allowed to speak. Followed by a few people in favor of your post after that sponsor gets another minute or so to address the floor. I was a delegate. amendments, and so I would get to address the convention, over and over and over and as amendments are primed to me, determined delegates can grind the convention. The first section we were to vote on was pre-emble between knowledge and God's Bureau of Creators and Families Foundation for Culture. We embraced free markets, recognized that tax and regulatory burdens are a threat to our freedoms, not any on the news. Where we could vote on the pre-emble and have an occurred to me in two minutes. For example, to delegate the pose to the line be added, stating that the party was open to all who accepted basic principles, regardless of race, religion, sex, or national words. After debate, the first resolution of the day passed by a stress-in-a error. Race, greed, sex, national origin, something to see. Improved microphone, poseed the Justin Hassan STEM and also be inherently consumingaydy. The term is taking place only because we can not bring the lassen up underhuity back into the rests of central and central and different laws. Well, Steve's a member of the Soundmeac, who was able to evaluate and sounded to me 1,500 or 89 to the level. Then the liberty suit, my dash to a microphone, very light, no address, and I'll post this as respect for the individual or the bedrock of the public values, the King County Public Authority here by Greg Price's fundamental human rights of gay and lesbian nursing Jack elements, fringe public and party. and exploit fear and hate for the game let's be embarrassed. This is a short term. Through the shouting I pointed out that we can count any Republicans can't have a book with us. We can't say in one breath that we oppose discrimination, or next breath supports discrimination against game let's be sure. So let's vote up. Do we? Republicans can't count any recognize the book? fundamental rights of gay lesbian or gay citizens or do we not? Well, we do not. After subeded debate, the names of us called, her son, and the American, my amendment was voted down. After my amendment failed, woman and the cross-well had a problem. Why are you wearing that hat she is misplaced with lawyer? Because I'm a cross-well.  where she stands on gay things, don't you? The thing recently had a conversation with fellow and the song I'm not certain you did. But I'm not. I smile. a form-minded friend and fellow craftsman support her, a sing-vision warrior. Try to imagine now that you are homophobic Republican jerk off, which might be a trick. Let me see, that you're county convention. You came for the speeches and I click the t-shirt, well actually,  how to know. This is what you do for fun, Luhu. But these three guys keep introducing pro-gay rights. moving to the anti-game and instructing, generally messy crap. You didn't come to the convention to defend your party's homophobia, and you certainly didn't come expecting to listen to a game and giving speeches all day long. Who are these guys? And why is that one wearing a crass-low hat? Okay, you're this person, what do you do? You get mad. Very, very mad. One delegate decided to get even. And what can only be described as a David Lynch mong. Paul's name is no one gets negative,  the phone can post a change in the office. No further discussion on homosexuality in the loud. It's a resolution that just two thirds majority of the past because it's a rules change not a system. And past it did, to hoots and hollers and cheers. But we had yet to vote on the education system, to paint, paint, mud, and sexuality. When we got to education, all hell broke us. Robert's rules were to fetish his love to their feet, insisting that the attack ain't planking yet. section would happen to be struck. We can't discuss homicies well. We can't vote on it. Voting is discussion. -oh, we were talking about homicies well and again. People were bullying, shouting, overdue family. The chair bringing room to order. Calmly rule that no further discussion resolution. Applied only to pro gay discussions. We could discuss homicies well and it said, but only if we weren't seeing anything nice Let'sお願いします! most of the day having been wasted with baby gay rights, gay marriage, what makes people gay and lying in the house? What I'm learning? Here's what I learned about Republicans. They don't  homos very much. They certainly don't  having to talk about us and they certainly  listening to us even less. But they do  beating up on us and their plop moves. In County Republicans, I'll make you a deal. We've lost out of your platform in 98 from the exponential cycle. And I'll stay away from your convention. But we're in the platform by attacking the tour. Oh, dance habits rates are syndicated sex advice, calm sad, club, software, several books most recently. The kid, what happened after my boyfriend and I said it's getting pregnant, option stories. Dan has continued his activism in the Republican Party, and as we explained to you, he has to vote in Iowa's straw polls, forbs, and that's online, and there. It's America, we have said, WWW.islike.1. Coming up, illegal aliens who agree that they should be deported, take matters into their own hands, and other unlikely stories. See you in a minute. I'll book it. Good listening music This American life my class, each week on our program of course we choose theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on it. This program is in the wake. First Iowa Presidential Strophole with just 14 months left in the election season. We've been using election stories hopefully to a store or a sense of hope. I'll have been taking the election coverage we did on this very life four years ago during the last big election cycle. We've arrived at a three of our program. three, heat and repeat. This is the story of an idealistic political movement which likes so many can telephonio, the self-dequitation movement. So back on the air, back around the election day, 1996. Hey, paedra, no big mess, y'all. Stop taking our job. It's not looking at my daughter. Immigrants, are you tired of being pushed around in the committee, y'all? Well, don't sit on your setup, do something about it. Join the consumative little group. Haltode. Hispanics against liberal takeover. I am the chairman of the Nielder Portad. But is self deportation, who has figured out as a permanent vacation? Immigrants. Join Haltode today and see your homeland. Thought deportations betrayed Markov's panicked global tech subject Greece to Voltaire will be perpetrated to make every promise countering this. Also, the deportation of five no change. Stricted for one way and until deportation is removed Markov's panicked. Well, this is a programming telephony, maybe familiar with the subtitles. With the sound mix, it's good for a takeover. There are a militant self-depression. There's all parties to leave the states. That's  all parties. It's founder Daniel Dportado, a spirit of Spanish language, TV, and actually self-video. This is a big, interesting, interesting audience. It's the outed nonstop-famous entire course. Mr. Aquatala says the story is made, when we read the story about Mexican Americans, who were a favorite California's Prophecy ship on the 7th, propaneid said, there's the French cut off social services. He thought this Mexican Americans, who were favorite of cutting off their services, had the right idea, but just did not go far in the eye. They just didn't take it to the right conclusion. And he thought itself to the petition, there's the old solution. We feel that the immigrants are taking that. too many jobs are bringing down quality of life but they're not allowing our young American teenagers to be cared for building experiences of picking fruit and not cleaning hotel beds. So what's your valuation of this week's election results? Where are the election results in California good or bad for your subject? Well luckily a beet will still with us of course I was a chairman of originally ab Hispanics were the World War I-87. Well, the Protestantism was the entire Christianism, it's just it. And past, saying that illegal immigrants could I received any social services. Right, right. And me, or also sponsoring, after the next election, the Aronianist did the Spikon Spanish, which should be responding to aama so not to 아닌 politics in obstacle in favor of stopping this news. And I'mückker, and I think this turned out that I spill the blood out of my gallery. Of course this happened quite a lot stop promoting illegal culture, Spanish. Basically we're trying to prohibit any sort of activity which might attract extreme discriminatory but such as dancing macarena that would now be punishable by for Saturdays of freeway pickup. And they 200 can get out of the fine. Pretty steep. And also, you're saying no, certain words. or anywhere in Spanish such as Los Angeles, California, San Diego, Burrito, Burrito, yes, in Toronto. No, it's a traditional thing  Linda Ronstab, right? Now we banned. This one's which is interesting for Mexican song. Yes, the one that she doesn't understand, she's saying, but it's very hard for me. It's  a Yodel out to the immigrants saying, are you out there? As you can see, she's been talking for about 23 years. She's an American in a newspaper, right? Not only honey is your citizen, but they thinkodu got Buzz that other people look at the 애� again. Isn't it easy to understand if they're fighting for casa? is there anyone out there, which you  to come to America, that's a basic thing to want to say. But when she sings this Spanish language song, you need to use people across the border with power for voice. Yes, it is a major conspiracy. You do not know. Governor Wilson has discovered that there is a major conspiracy to get all sorts of indios from remote villages to come over. When Clinton says it takes a village, I mean he's talking about importing all village for mutual gun. So also we have discovered with the help of Governor Wilson that the Makarena is actually a very sinister mind controlled device and it's part of conspiracy to control the white elections people mind. What do you mean? What is it doing to the point? We actually have a translation here by researchers that we can read from. I'd share, will these are the words to the micro-ray? Yes, sure. And so my bodyguard, Rudy Riko, will do the translation in English. I will read you the short term in a super-beboarded Spanish term. So here we go. Give me your bodyguard, I'll read you. in La Fura del Vandeira de Trachin. School of Police. Celadio Condosalmírus. The goal cooks on food for my friends. Makarena. Makarena. Student. So, as you can see, this is a very sinister device. Then you'll dip it out of it. If you actually believe in deportation, what are you yourself doing? Well, I... I am here to help everyone. Get out. I hope to look forward to the day where I stand at the border and say the last face. Please turn up, tell the morning, please turn up the lights. That will be me. Daniel DeCortado, Chairman of the Spanxi Institute of OJ. But  most! Act 4, during money at the problem. For back in 1996, when the Democratic Convention came to Canada and Chicago, the city did a multi-million dollar cleaner convention, called the word between downtown and the United States. And the United States, in the sports of New York, in the United States, held. Well, one night after the convention, the jumped in a cab with some other people, strangers, convention doors, and we set up a new road street, then to the road towns, back to the The moon was out, the air was perfect, street was freshly paved, and woman from Washington, D.C. of obvious who had attended the convention in a sky box, remarked, Chicago is so beautiful, there are no particles, the homeless people in the way they were so beautiful. Now don't be wrong, I love Chicago. We have to say we do have our fair share of hot holes, homeless people and bad weather. I knew before this moment that money could not buy love, but I had no idea to buy this level of misperception. This next story is about what all the cameras and other political elites see in the neighborhoods they drive through and what they don't see. You may remember the best selling book there are no children here, you can hear us back. In it, writer Alex Potowitz described the lives of two brothers at the Henry Corner homes, made to a TV film by Oprah Winfrey, been mentioned many times in speeches by Jack Camping by others. While Henry Corner is the public housing project that sits right across the street from the United Center, where the convention is held. And when Chicago did its multimillion dollar cleanup for the Democratic Convention, he cleaned up some of the corner. The boys from Alex Potowitz spoke an out-young man and they do not live at the corner anymore. So they go back now in the end and during the convention we asked one of them, girl, Walton, who is that eight thing, to give us a tour of what had changed it one of them because of the convention and what hadn't changed. One of the most interesting things about this report is how much of the neighborhood had improved for political and legal reasons for all sorts of reasons that never entered our national political consciousness. They never became part of indiscution of what's going on in our cities, they never became part of the discussion of how things might improve. Here, once again. again. It's very smart. Now let me have one of five years ago, it looked  Ghost Town, Oak Green Grand, Brooklyn Woodley, Sweet Year. Now here we want this dip. There are rows of flowers that have come in the middle of the house. There are trees, the alleys, most of the chains have been set up in the middle of the world-class walls. for school to be. There's a new playground. Big lot. You use new floor and green television. Nice, any playground I've ever seen in the city, even on a lot of side. Everyone knows one. I  it more. I know what I did. I got a grandson in the car. You should take a piece and then go get a piece. The friend needs some. People say a lot of other things too. And I all of them make them. what can you have told me about the playground? The village class is really advanced and nobody came to be out there. They say, yeah, you want to have the damn it's time. You do, you don't feel the wrong section. You don't feel the wrong section. You don't feel the wrong section. You don't feel the wrong section. You don't feel the wrong section. People as one are glad about this position. Most of them say they're mad and it's a present for the city. They're not going to be mad. I'm not going to be mad. I'm going to be mad. Something's here, but what I'm changing, something's still safe. I shoot it, I'm not there. When I was a kid, I was running a house on a shooting stop. Saying what my nephew snob was in this funny gym today. Always time to all hot day, man. , hot day, day off, day off. To waste, So some broken shot, he has shot in A. But I'm doing it now, you think? Then you see now, tell me what you're talking about. Usually when you hear about the projects, you hear the things that they get in the first. But when I went to Hona, I heard a different story. They are still seeing the studio. still gang, but mostly people told things slow down. In 1991, residents of Illinois have a lawsuit against the city and women, because of that, Chicago House was painted up, renovated all the parts, but then knew all of it. And down the world's beard, they moved 230 times out of one city in the next half. So Uhh 24 hours is good agora, but instead of fading off season 3. So it's going a lot of those in front of you. So, the crown here is a crown. It's got a lot of them. They go as much as you. So, at least around the more so and so and so. So, they fit that right. They go as far as they want. See if they have fun and so on when strap from up. Maybe it's hard to see. Now, this is my grandma. She says, same. She thinks, yeah, that. It's in front of her car. The car's with music already. She told me about my daughter. But the step is going to go around here and never reach out nothing else in around here. somebody gets killed in their shoes. She's not too safe. I walk up after South Africa in over  spiel. I have to take the place  the Dundabrake. And Dundabrake. Of course I'm not that dark. I'm not that dark. I'm not a fool of you. Don't get$%%! Natalie! KG!! Help me!!! One of the things that the president invented in America is Gonschild in Civilhaiden and one of whom a father and man 26ly a child has detailed money 셋ieeh He was willing to live His glory in the earth filled with beautiful chains of thousands Old pool taking A basketball shirt Cynar blockwall His matigration After the grandpa age angle. These work in the boys in the girls group 40 years. Everybody knows everybody respects. These were listed to bring the body listed to teach. What parents? What even a clothing? It's only person I want to walk into the middle of a gang fight and make a stop. In fact, these families put something into a fight. The major would be the first person to tell you about all the fights and stuff. Use a job on A guy with these three guys. How do  yet? Do ? What do you have one in the city? So I get you guys. So I have to grab this guy and take this knife away from him. What a guy I am out there. 12 months ago, the gentleman one guy, and maybe so many hours will look. I'm gonna take all three of you guys. One of the guys. And I take him one of the camera's all three of them do a damn mess. I picked him up and told him over here. Tell me. You got me. Some people say, I think I say, I'm gonna throw some two of them thumbs with them. I'll do a few of the game. So I'm gonna shoot him. I pray to see this says people who have less time to fool around without me going to die I'm resting to be a construction and clean a place up. Love the friend of mine says people are getting that accident because now the city is keeping people out, they are building some. And they don't want to lose their home. The way major sees me, but they are better because they are people on one side. How children time has been stoned and I will make it to this major, to God. You have a guy  me working with me today. When you walk to the La Lange and just came out there. So there's a lot of things I do for my life and I'm so basketball. And when you want to go back to school, I see you go back to school. The goal is jail, I send them money, stuff  that. I'm really saying, you do the fat house act. You're sad I'm right. Major's working hard, you're fat ass. The main room was dressed in a desert soakery. Inside there are all the soakers one back more and baseball team, best part to support me. Appearance back up the soakery, there are bits of corner rhythm, who may something up your life, who can have the project one on the big rating. All three of those on means of theirqc. And Lisa is not the Stephen Parker that she called her state. Because we're getting an A-ring back.
