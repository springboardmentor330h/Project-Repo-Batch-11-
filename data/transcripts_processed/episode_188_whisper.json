  "text": "better remembers exactly when she learned the assumption too. She was in second grade, ran to a best friend Rachel, and scolded him. And she called me aside and said, , last night of, , I lost a tooth and I woke up while tooth fairy was putting the money under my pillow and guessing the tooth fairy was, I said, oh my god, who was it? I have to know, she said, my dad, my dad is tooth fairy. And I remember running home. after school and telling my mom, mom, I knew that she's very it's, and declaring it as if I had grown up. That I knew who the truth very was. And she said, oh, well, who is the truth fairy? And I turned her and I said, Rachel's dad is too fairy. Ronnie Loverfeld is the truth fairy. And she said, I can't believe . know it's totally secret you can't let anyone else know but your right Ronnie is too fairy and  if he works really hard and  it's a secret so you can't let anyone else know he is too fairy you can't let anyone else know and from that day on Ronnie Ronnie little and felt his too fairy and all of my notes under my pillow we're signs love Ronnie love herself now in his day job what did Ronnie go up with her I think he did something in finance who's either an accountant or a stock broker who are next to a stock and shop in Massachusetts and Newton. At dark hair, worse suit, and I definitely had images of his driving this Volvo around Boston area and delivering two fairy treats. I remember wondering what it was  for Rachel to know. that her dad was too fairy. He's definitely being a little envious that her dad had the special job and the special power and that he had this whole other interesting life where my dad just came home from work and that was it. So when you would actually run into running over food, what was it  for you? How would you act? I tried to act cool. I didn't want to, , it's  if you're star struck, but you don't want them to know that you're star struck. Just  needing a celebrity. Exactly, you downplay it. Try not to mention it, but you definitely. check them out twice and  look at them when they walk away. I don't know that's too fast. But you knew enough to play a cool. I knew enough to play a cool. I said hey, how you doing? what's for dinner? How am I getting home tonight? Am I parents going to pick me up if they call? You did play a cool. What interesting question in all this? Why did both girls come to what seems  the least likely to be inclusion from the evidence in front of them of a parent slapping money for a tooth under it. But I wasn't gotten at studies how children think Jesus of course is logical for a seven-year-old deep fluid that her own father might be the two parents. Children understand that their parents' roots are powerful in all sorts of ways that they can be very different from children. Now, from a child's point to view, knowing where those powers begin and and is pretty tricky, I mean think about all the things that your parents can do that you can't do. Think about, in fact, there isn't any obvious explanation about why your father can use a visa card. Yeah. Which is something that you can't do. The power to be a choose carrier is all of that, which more is all that much more impressive. This is a certain kind of story that kids tell,  the Ronnie Globeth felt story, but they look at something going on around them. Observe it carefully. Think about it logically. I want to think next to the next. Then come. conclusions that are completely incorrect. Therapist Iggin Goldman and Texas tells this story about a little girl and airplane. Then she was about four years old and her very first flight and as the plane was airborne she turned to the woman next to her and said, when do we get small? That had been her experience at their point of watching airplanes take off. They do get small. These stories are  jokes and they're also  poems. I think because there's this aha quality to them. Some connections is made between the surprisingly, a wrong computer. And part of what makes you so satisfying as stories is that the logic in them is perfectly reasonable. And at the same time, completely and utterly wrong. We at this American life love these stories. And so today we bring you a full hour of them. From WBC Chicago, Public Radio International, it's system. in life, on my reglass. Today in our show, Kid Logic, our show in 4X at 1, baby scientists with faulty data, 2, the gaming over till the Pat Some Man sings, and that actually here one boy's explanation of how love works at 3, where wolves in their youth. That story on the gap between adult and Kid Logic on Michael Shabon, at 4, 1 Brain Tranks, 1 Brain Grows, the story of a dad who's sick, the story of a girl. boy and perhaps not very helpful lessons, but my aim is to stay with us. And one, 30 scientists with healthy dating. 30 years ago, psychologists in scientists believed that babies could not be in an all, but they were irrational, logical, self-centered need and want. Which scientists  to know? The last 30 years is that this is not true. The children are observing the world and thinking about and come to logical conclusions in the day they're born. Now listen, Gottman, in two of our colleagues, decided to summarize a lot of this research in the book, they called it the scientist in the crib, meaning the babies are  little scientists. They argue that when a small baby sits in a high chair, it drops a spoon onto the floor, over an open, from a mom or dad and up. But the baby is doing essentially, this running little baby sized spoon. Because it turns out the babies are very interested in gravity and how gravity works. The fact that things fall down and not up is not off the space. And it turns out another thing they're very interested in is human beings and how they work. We are actually the lab rats. They're actually doing experiments on us to see how we tend. So when you play across the spruce, you get to the price of oil, you get an experiment about gravity, you get a little physics tutorial, and you get a psychology tutorial. about how that person will do something over and over again. While kids think of the same logic that adults use and apply that logic just as regularism, there are certain things that they simply do not know. And take a lot of figure out. Up to 67 years old for instance, it's not exactly clear to anyone, what is imaginary and what is not. Or if wishing for something to make it come true, there's a wonderful experiment at the same. actually, or Harris wanted, where he got children to imagine that something was in box. So he would say, okay, now, here's the box, then open up, close it. Now let's imagine there's a puppy in the box. Or else let's imagine that there's a mouse, and he asked the children, is there really a mouse to the box? Is there really a puppy in the box to sit now? They could just imagine. Then the researcher would walk out and then moving the box behind with the child. And then something funny would happen. The kids who were told to imagine a puppy in the box would go over and pee inside the box, just a cat. And the kids who were told to those in monster in the box, they would edge away from the box. So, they weren't going to take any chances. Just in case wishing actually could make monsters happen. They didn't want to take any chances about what was going on in that box. But by the time the children are six or seven, they  grown-ups, they've understood that just wishing. things isn't going to be bad. When it's still small and inexperienced about what happens in the real world, children have to make logical inferences all the time based on the data that they do have. Here is how children responded when our producer Jonathan Goldstein asked him about the two-fair. What do you think she does with all of these teeth that she's collected? Where is she getting this into the people without teeth? who? people? What do you think she does with all these teeth? Not really, she just likes to collect teeth and make things out of me. You're all kind of stuff. Well I can stop next to house. So, it's supposed to be. And I do stuff. How many teeth do you think it takes to make a tooth house? 100? 100. Why when she just make the house out of bricks,  everyone else? Because I... because no one does have a break-keep. These stories were kids take a perfectly logical premise and go through a series of perfectly logical deductions that lead to perfectly incorrect conclusions. Turns out that science does not have a name for these stories. Which is surprising, given how common they are, and how they are recognized around the world for this. here entertainment value. Here we've collected a few more. We lived in the duplets. The duplets is directly to the left and right of us what I'm saying across the street from us all aren't . So there's no such thing that's walking up to me screaming. I just quite we all looked alike we all had carbon and so on. When I became mobile when I got my phone when I got my first try. I go a little bit further so I ventured down the street and I looked in that song. these couples said maybe these two people, but there were people that had the receiver for it and they said anything  this because they were white and because I had never seen white people, I assume they were ghosts. So I'm way, I'm wondering if I'm way, , what kind of people are they, what do you think they're talking? So I'm way, and I remember hearing the man going wow It was  a scientific discovery. I discovered the first Gulf data and they talked to me. They kind of communicated. I weighed. They weighed. I said hello and they said hello and they're lying. Yeah. But all began at Christmas two years ago when my daughter was four years old. It was the first time she had ever asked about. what do this how they mean. And so I explained to her that this was celebrating the birth of Jesus and she wanted to know more about that and we went up and bought a kids buy ball and had these readings at night. She loved wanting to know everything about Jesus. So we read a lot about this birth and about his teaching and she would ask it's customary what that phrase was. It's my imagination is, do one to others, is you would have them do one to you. And we would talk about those old words and put that all meant, ? And then one day we would drive and pass a big church and help front and I'm going this crucifix. She said, who is that? And I guess I'd never really told that part of the story. So I had to sort of, yeah, oh, well, that's Jesus. And I forget to say the ending. Yeah, well, . He ran a foul with a Roman government. , this message that he had, so radical and unnerving, to the prevailing authorities in the time that they had to kill them. They came to the conclusion that he had to die. That message was to Krableson. There's about a month later after that Christmas, he'd known to the whole whole. story of what Christmas meant and it was Medgenior and her preschool celebrates the same holidays as the local schools. So, Martin Luther King didn't just off, so I knocked off our tattoo and I decided we'd play and I took her out the launch and we was sitting in there and right on the table where we happened to pop men was the art section of the local newspaper and there at the jag枝 life is a huge drawing by  a ten-year-old kid in the office schools of Martin Luther King. And yeah, she said, is that? And I said, well, because it happens, that's Martin Luther King. He's why you're not in school today, through celebrating his birthday. This is the day we celebrate his life. And he said, so who is he? I said, who is it? He was a preacher. And she looks at me. So, Jesus... He said, yeah, he actually was. But there was another thing that he was doing, famous for. Which is that he had a message. Can you try to say this to a FOIA? It was very, , this is the first time they ever hear anything. So it was very careful about how you phrase everything. So, as I said, , well, yeah, he was a preacher and he had a message. She said, well, this is massive. I said, well he said that you should treat everybody the same, no matter what they love about it. She thought about that for a minute. And she said, well that's what Jesus said. I said, I guess it is. I mean, I mean, we thought of it that way, but yeah, let us sort of do another thing. And we should have a minute. And see, talk a minute and then said. But they kill him too. Not too. The game he over to the Fatson man sings. Little kids talk about a crush, love. And they're talking about more of us the same thing that adults mean by those words. Or how he check words and then they're how he thought about what I'm grateful. He won a girl's leg and never seemed to. He was looking back on it. I think part of the problem is how I thought about love as a kid. I had a few ideas about how you get something to love you that, in retrospect, won't particularly help for me. First, I thought that they could see me sleeping. They would immediately fall from me. When I went to sleep each night and touched the child's sleep in a cute way just in case the girls are  repeat pardon me. I won't just see the ball at the table and scrunch my head and smile. pillow handling my head. I imagine all the popular girls tend to truly crank me, but a ladder, trying to find my bedroom window. Instead of painting fatso, or whatever I'm a window is planned, the collective hearts of adults, as they suddenly seem to have been in angel. Very snugly and in my blankets. I guess with some crossover, the kids' knowledge of what isn't due to adults, quite the romance. The Second Theory was that it found another space that could seem really allowed. This conclusion came out of my experience with me since the nephews, but it found all over me without a reason. By age six, I was already an awful one, and thought to slap me a certain maturity. Often, at recess time, I go to the back of the class and read some of the selection of kids books, all the kids of the other round in the circle, I had poor food books Percy the Rose and in Donkey, affecting the voices of the different characters and speaking with the preacher's sweaty charisma. Much to wide. But everyone in my class seemed to love the way I ended up. You only found what this was. He goes and class ended up treatment at the Ranko. And call me, Uncle Howie, taught me in baby time. He'd be a story on the Howie, so on. Look at me, Ryan, love the attention, but I want to love, love, love. So I had all these ideas about love. And all the girls I knew, my theories and most intensely targeted one day. The most popular room school, can. She came a most serious crush. She carried a torch for Karen from grade 1 grade 6. Though Karen didn't seem to  me much, one thing I learned about love on TV is that if one was sincere, love and break all boundaries. I believe that they would come a moment right to speak towards, I love you to Karen. With such tenons and tears that would break her heart, and she would cry to, and confess her mouth. I will allow one brave to travel down my team for a moment. missiles that work and with SM records staging and now you later share tests that last day you were through the JESS Mason that never was spoken to her but popular. I want to know what you remembered, but she knew I even had a question heard all. Who are your interests? Who go you're by your? She definitely is. I'm interest. Barry's son. The big one. The big one. More than the other? Yes. Yes. Yes. Notice she doesn't mind. Even though it was so fun to past, crushes still such an awkward thing to talk about. When I finally did talk about how I... felt about it when we were kids. It sort of mumbled my way through it back peddling all over the place. I even forgot to actually point the mic in. What I was in there. On the next floor you were  a big crush. You see? I just didn't know that. I just didn't see something. I didn't realize that there was a crush in the world. Maybe at the time I knew, but I had no clue actually that you liked me when I think back it on it now. One time in the field, he told me to tap him and said, he taped her, so  you, he will be popping. He's the thing. So the story goes, that's very pretty fast, I don't know. It's very bad, I always break them right. Basically, we have to understand off this sidelines, it was not ever since often picked to play, so we could put that game in some of our very fun. He said, method cannot be possible. Kids beyond the or show affection is through physical   something you before  I wrestle with Barry because you just want to be close. This is not how she felt about that the time. Here's I felt the harder I tackle them the more popular. I took it down  it was prison football. The game came to the medium and everyone circling challenge riding body with football near her leg pulleys thing. This is holding a leg that can't be seen. It's a lot. You broke my leg. Karen doesn't remember any. She doesn't remember how she then jumped up, got four or five of her girlfriends in the huddle, and miraculously carried her graph an informed team course line of fat so many, to the tune of the girls' people of match-up. Fat so fat so many, I would not  to be a fat so many, fat so fat so many, and at that point the off-huddle hands up near a new song. I remember it so perfectly that then after while it was my crush, she had no recollection of the time the school part of her called the Daisy Deep and then tried to run and called me boss hard. For the fitness day that I beat her in a charity fire style race, she knew we would remember the biggest throw in the mall. The sixth grade graduation dance. Now the last dance was there to have me. I watched the dance and I couldn't. But I couldn't. Because as I was walking, I lined a few people walk by and walking. And then it was the split second. But then you were in the arms of the Lord's scene. Really? Yeah. Also, can't talk and do that. The crash, our great six-kil longer was in the arms. I don't know. He was talking about the long-ish hair, and he came to the back door of the gym. They don't remember the last end? No. But you kissed this gentleman. Did I? They could talk to our main cousins. My adult standards it was a pack and I'd say by great six-starred you got Turns out the camera member exactly one story about me well my most vivid memory of the sitting in class to address me as to put her homework and you I'm gonna give you a dance and the paper kind of overflowing out of that desk and you Remaging frantically through the desk trying to find what homework We were asked to take out and not being able to find it and our teacher walking up to desk And everyone knowing what was coming because it probably happened two days before and Teacher just Lacing into you and Do you want to go to the school? No, I mean, , I mean, , I mean, , I mean, I mean, , I mean, that happened , did I see cool at the bad boy? No. Everyone's talking very, very sad for you. One of the things I wanted to turn to notice me, but not in that way. I think the problem with my theories is that I expected her to fall from me to similar I thought for her. I choose to move from afar. Do we see her? to our classmates, Stephen and little Prince. I thought that's what it took for some of the following months. I wanted her to think that this was the real need. I wanted to think it was the need. In the truth of it, it's at the real real need to get them smoothed up. And I have ears desk filled on the ground each day. There's a way from leather grown grades 6 that's never happening. There's something about kids or at least the way I was as a kid. I was purely romantic. And the truth is the love of solitary sense of the word. Only a year or two later, my series in the ways love changed drastically. I sent grade and had some stupid bottle sessions in my belt and I included them instead of dreaming about a true love I couldn't have. She got a little bit more pragmatic in my class. One night, after deciding I wanted to have a B-O girl friend, called the Grand Tourism and we told her and sometime that I wasn't expecting the Attent navigation. Did a real that our woman was a family man. I told her that I liked her and asked her she liked to officially go out with me. She's a timely told me, she only liked me as a friend, but she was friends. No problem, I said, is it was a bit home? She passed me over to her twin, but I made the same offer to you. And I was a bit sad to share. And that was it. There are that for twins, what's the difference? We went up to two whole months. It was great. How do you check it? It's the creative writer, it is behind how we action comes. Coming up, kids talking kid talk, adults not understanding that you will, as a special kid say that our industry is an addition of our program for things in a minute, which is a title of our video, when our program continues. This American life America has been taking a program of course we choose some topic. the new age variety of different things of Sons and Neckon and this program. Kid logic, we wanted an hour of sort of stories in which kids employ kid thinking, especially the kid thinking that it's perfectly logical but completely wrong headed, and we have arrived to that three of our show, that three werewolves in their youth. We have this excerpt in this act, from a short story, I  to share it on. I had known him as a bulldozer, as a samurai, as an android, program, that is plastic glue in time. The human man and the metal underground is a real collector, is a beautiful truck, and even for a week is the Machina Bridge, but it was as a wearable to Mr. Stokes finally in the end to the fog. I wasn't there when it happened. I was down in the middle of the scene at the edge of the school yard, found a little capital for an empire of ants. I just begun to describe to myself and to the ants the complicated right-and-sacre to the god with worship I was imposing on them. when I heard the first scream from the playground. The girl screamed at Timothy the same way every time she laughed at me. He was unicy, and with a chill that sounded almost  the right. Because if they were watching the family, tat, trot, and asking something the right means, jaws. I scrambled up the side of the ravine and removed as Timothy. Shoulders, hudts, arms, outstretched, growl, he or his dick. And declared that he was hungry for the folks of New Zealand. We'll Timothy said this or something  it every time he told you to. I would not have been too concerned if the course of his last transformation, he would have actually gone and bitten the genetic news on the neck. There's common knowledge around school that Virginia's parents have since been unlettered in the principal, the next time, Tennessee Stokespurts and then there's going to be a spell. Timothy was in our teacher, Mrs. Gladvector's words, one strike away from the heart. And there was a widespread, unarticulated hope among his classmates and parents, all of the teachers and copeland for elementary, that one day soon, he would provide the authorities to excuse they needed to pack him up to special school. I stood there while above my own little city, watching Timothy pursue a snuggling room on the course along the hopscotch classes. With some or other do something calm and down, but I... was the only one in our school who didn't have any reason to want to save to Mr. Stokes from its bolshan. And I hated it, with all my heart. I've been cursed for 300 years in claim. His wearing his standard uniform of white tongue greaves in a plain white undershen. Even though it was a chilly afternoon in our October, all the way. the best of us at Langson's been bundled up for autumn, recorded a new down. I've encouraged to stock the night through all eternity, yet I've been searching for praise lovely as you! The nuns toward the nearest wall of the cage of girls around you. The girls healed away from whom his little sprayed with a hose, bumped shoulders, clung shooting to each other's sleeves. Some of them were singing the song we sang about Tennessee Stokes. Tennessee Stokes, Timothy Stokes, are going to the home for crazy folks. No one singing allowed us as a geniephys herself, the very black coat, the bright red tints. Virginia had blonde hair and she was the only girl in the fifth grade with pierced ears and painted fingernose, and Timothy Stokes was a little longer than me. In me this, this is Stokes' living next door to us, and I was privy to all kinds of secrets and I'm sure every figure gets it right. no desire to know. I forbade myself in almost religious severity to show intimacy any kindness I would never let him sit beside me, but lunch or in class, and if you tried to talk to me on the playground I ignored him, he was bad enough that I had to live more stored in him. It was toward Virginia that Timothy now advanced, Ratman growling his throat. To do back behind our girlfriends and their screaming now grew less melodious, purely for Timmancy crops down on all force rolled his wild white eyes and just got last look around. That was when he saw me halfway across the other distance in the summer. He was looking at me I thought, Zoe hope I might have something I wanted to tell him. Instantly I dropped Slad on my belly, my heart pounding the way it did when I was spotted trying to spy out of baseball game or a birthday present. I said, down into the revealing backward. The first I could hear the girl shouting from Mrs. Gladfaltor and then I heard Mrs. Gladfaltor herself sound very angry and the bell sounded the end of recess and everything got very quiet but I just stayed there and maybe. I told myself that I didn't feel sorry at all for stupid old Tennessee spokes but then I would remember the two views looked in his eyes as I had abandoned him to his fate. To all the unimaginable things that would be done until then love. fabulous corridors in the special school. I kept recalling something that I had heard Timothy's mother say to mine, just a couple of days earlier. No, after the Stokes had told by a mother that big, sad, donkey voice of him. No, a little pause to miss his own new friend. I decided to spend the afternoon or evening. The sun started. down behind the embankment and the moon rising early emerged from the wrist tops of the houses somebody was putting up in front of the school. The moon I noticed not quite full. I didn't hear the scrape of footsteps until they were just above my head. Paul said this is glad Doctor, the moon over a little bit of being and against their thighs. Paul Covelle, what on earth are you doing out here? Nothing! I didn't hear the bell. Paul! he said, now listen to me, Paul, I need your help. But what? I didn't think she looked angry, but her face was upside down when it was hard in the towel. With tin from Paul, I guess he's just very wound up right now. He's pretending his aware was today, and even though that's fine, we all know how Timothy is sometimes, we have serious things to discuss with him, and we'd  him to stop pretending from this to little while. What if he isn't pretending? He said, what if he really isn't aware was? Maybe he is. But if you would just come inside and talk to him for a little bit, I think we might be able to persuade him to change back into Timothy You're his friend. I asked him if he'd  to talk to you and he said yes I'm not his friend. This is a great thought. There. I swear to God. I can't do anything Paul Timothy isn't Trump He needs your help and I need your help to now if you come right this minute and get up out of that dirt Then I'll forget that you didn't come in for recess Don't come back inside. I'll have to speak mother. So I took her head, let her pull me out of the reveal and across the deserted playground. But where they're doing so I was merely proving the unspoken carillary that my mother left hanging the other morning in the air between her and the systems. There was a song about me too, I must say, popularly remember that wait. What's that smell of? All covello. He's a big staff. Jella and the Snoop. He smells  poop. He smells  tomato, these alphabets. Timothy Stokes, I knew, as I followed Mrs. Brad's doctor down the long silent hallway to the office, hating him more and more with each stem. His mind will send. Timothy was sitting in a corner of the office trapped in an orange vinyl onion. There was a Roman Mourmore 3 scratched with his left cheek and his brilliant white shirt and trousers were paddled with camouflage of grass and dirt and asphalt. Well now Timothy, this is Gladful for a tip of the body shoulder, and maneuvered me around me. Look who I found! A Timothy, I said. Timothy didn't look up. This is Gladful for a game of gentle push for me in the small amount of time. I don't see town. No! I didn't want to be left alone with Timothy. Now because I was afraid of him, but because I was afraid that somebody would come into the office and see a sitting there, to matching rejects and matching orange chairs. That's enough now, Paul, for Mr. Budava, for principle, his friend, this smile looked to the more false than usual. Sit down. It's all right, so this is fine, okay? You see what you can do about helping Timothy turn back into Timothy. We're just going to give you a little bit of fun. to follow Mr. Buter bought into his office and went poker head back around the door. I'm going to leave this door open until he's new to sound right. There were three chairs next to Timifese. I took the farthest and showed him my back so that anyone passing by the windows of the office would not be able to conclude that he and I were engaged in any sort of conversation. Are you expelled? I said. There was no reply. Are you Timothy? Again, he said nothing, and I couldn't stop myself from turning around to look at him. Timothy, are you expelled? I'm not Timothy, professor. Said Timothy. Gravely, but not without a certain era of satisfaction. I'll afraid your precious antidote didn't work. For more, Timothy, said, cut it out. The moon's not even full today. Now he turned toward me. Where were you? This? I was looking for him. I was in the ditch. The ants and none. I heard you talking to them before. So, so are you at man? No, don't. Why not? Because I'm not anybody. You're not anybody, even. We felt silent for a while, just sat there, not looked for what we'd done to do it the legs and my chance. I could hear Mrs. his grad filter, Mr. Beautybot, Hotels, Software, his office, Mr. Beautybot, Conter, Elizabeth, the telephoto ring, a light flashed twice on the Secretary's phone, then held stem. Thanks for calling back Dr. Shaktor. I heard Mr. Beautybot say, yes, I'm afraid so, I went to see Dr. Shaktor at my home and said, we had Mike who not in the stem box. Yes, stitch I'm strong too. And now, why did you go see him? Did your mother make you? Yeah, I see him. How come? I don't know. She said I was having problems with my anger. I mean, I guess I was mad about my dad because he had to go to jail for me for some reason. Just for him, I said, I'm not sure if . I'll come. You had too much to drink, I said. because you visit him in jail, can you see said? No stupid. God, he was long in special sports in his age. I hope they make me eat special food and wear a special helmet or something. I heard the distant slam of the school's front door and then a pair of hard shoes knocked him along the hall. It comes your mother. What kind of special helmet is something to listen? And man, where's the helmet? This is Stokes Enter the Office. She was a tall, thin woman, much older than my mother, but long gray hair and red being in the hands. Every morning, she made Timothy tenkits with breakfast with sounded okay until you found out that she put things in them  carrots and left over pieces of corn. She said, with her ear voice. This is Stokes, said Mrs. Bradshaw, they're coming out of the principal's office. It's been kind of a long afternoon for Timothy and Timothy. How is Virginia, said Mrs. Stokes, She still hadn't looked at Timothy. Oh, she'll be fine, Mr. B. She said, just a little shaken up. We sent her home early. Of course, we added, the parents are going to want to speak to you. Of course, Mrs. Stokes. I'm... ready to do whatever you think would be best for Timothy. I'm not Timothy, simply. Oh, please, Timmy, stop this nonsense for once. I'm cursed, leaned over in broadest space here from his domain. Helving about the curse of Fassar. I looked at Timmy from, and for the first time, saw that a thin dark down and wolfish hair growl upon his teeth. Then... And I looked at Mr. Budabakh and found that he was watching me with an Arab earnest expectancy. So we honestly thought there might be an eternal black magical curse on Timothy. He was more than willing to listen to anything I might not have to say on the scene. I should. Are you going to make him go to Special School? I said. All right, Paul, thank you. So Mr. Klein, brother, you may go back to class now. See you later, Timothy. I said. You didn't answer me. You'd start to grow. The follow the secretary out of the office, I looked back and saw Mr. Duda-Bah, Mrs. Gladford and poor old Mrs. Stokes, stand over a hopeless circle around the living. And thought for something, when I turn back toward him, raised an imaginary rifle in my shun. This is a dark gun. Everyone let it know that. I was talking to Timifler. I was almost... but not quite humans. It's filled with darks of my special antidote and I made it stronger than it used to be. And it's going to work this time. And also there's a tranquilizer listening. Timifler's looked up and buried his teeth at the roof. And I took aim right between his eyes. I jerked my hands twice and went. I tried to get my hands twice and went. Timifler. his head snapped back and his eyelids sludged. His shook him soft from over. His swallowed once. And he held his hands out before him as a one-do-one up there. Here is his palate. Seems to have worked, he said. His voice cool and reasonable and fine. Anyone could see he was still playing his endless game, but all the grownups, Mr. Beauty Bond, or Titila, are very pleased to have both of us. Thank you very much. He said, I'm not hot, I said it. Everybody laughed, but Tindancy stills. The next step of Michael Shaban's short story, where we'll familiar you, in collection of short stories in the same name. Michael Shaban's son is novel, his telegraph album. That's for our one brain trinks, one brain grills. Back in 1999, Julie Hills Husband was diagnosed with a rare brain disease. Two years later, Nus' son Nick was just six years old. He began trying to make sense of what was happening to his dad. Julie gave us this dispatch back then, and how are some sneaking back from him? Nus' son is mad at calm, who's babies, and I blame the lying to him. about Mixilis for Baby by the World by the Girl of Park and the Seababian in Pirates and Is it? Eeeh, the baby. This school has mixed age classes, so there are kids aged 3, 4, 5, and 6. This fall, I found three-year-old little boy and new champs during Mixkoss, love champs in the same age as Penhallos with me. He had him chance in the same class in the United States, and taunt him, teasing Chester to his tummy. Call that call, NUD to will for school. The usual is a moon that you can figure out. The moon that I've read to him would ask me, Mom, has chance of baby? You can explain that chance is much younger but technically he wasn't a baby. Because quiet a while, then it also has babies with their stay. Finally, I got it. You see, in the light he knew the pureest father does. And the pig was in the film. That it's one big cycle. So I might die without other's or more, and I'm getting to eat another's meaty. It's all probably the great, great circle of life. So, if you're kid, you think if you could stop babies from going to the Lord, you would stop people from dying, you'd stop the circle. You need to thought of them no babies, then maybe they'd stay on the ground. So the name, chances were to threaten these deaths from these systems. If you ask me a husband's college friend's about him, I'll tell you dead was a comedian. Not that he really wanted me to run in on it. Dead was an advertising copy ready actually, but Dabbled an impardon stand up in the middle of human. Back in the 80s when answering machines or a movie cell tapes of the wacky, outgoing messages. Hi, sorry, I can't come to the phone right now. I'm in the bathtub listening to my radio. So if you want to just leave your message and your name at the town. Up, up, up! Somebody at the door, say what? Okay, so that's not that's me. Still I'm missing so much. Please move us firm. And I take that stupid thing in the same day. This is a recent voice movement. Thanks, Monday. It's happened. somebody... ...clobbers. into your life.... But with this Column girl, up, or whatever. Okay. Okay. Bye. He's praying, Trump. He has whispered in and sweating. Her results have Dr. PET S Boludio who showed that he had front to low dimension from the air to Chandu and autism he settled the слышant RO2. It's progression is similar to the all the babiesMm Oh a sav. The doctor said, Doug, 38 Ewell-Hansky, the marathon room seen consisted on their hand-fascals and two to ten years during this time, slowly, slowly, the use is a really work, dry, resin, feel emotions, help for the bathroom, walk, talk, swallow and breathe. Frominhusthong with papers from the third one that is considered the pediatriclamol. and his muscles are very magical to his ears. And he does this by looking for partners to help so that they're all out. This came up all the time. When he says before he got sick, Doug drove me to C-2. But as he got sick he could always sit in the passenger seat. About six months after he took the car keys away from dogma from two, killing from San Francisco. Tim did a possible seat. Mix that in the ball in his booster. Stared it to me. So in Justin said a woman then asked, Tim, do you have a brain disease? I'm not sure when it's time to confess for David to come. Maybe it was a day to the cab and turn, was missing until I got night. Maybe it was the day when I saw the boy there on the sheet and came up. Maybe it was the day when I was a homeless person to my house. But at some point it was just two weeks. Especially two weeks from the bus. Tag moved into lunch and came in. after that moved the mixed dress to me. To this ear, that came out of a spectrum coming, the mystic down, which is one of the get-bottom to come home. And here what I thought was a great idea of called over. I only proved as dark as a wild, current-opper's passive, and went through the rhythm hard to get down on the phone. Although 돼 Creepson I miss you daddy. I miss you too, sir. You need to start to tell Doug about his day, how he played outside and how he's conditioning. Then I heard the recording of the operating room. If you'd  to play some call, please hang up. Doug it'll work on me. The way Nick and the sense of all this can be. to watch the video. This conclusion is a perfectly logical and sometimes the only way to address this verse is to use the same logic hidden with the same assumptions. For example, last Mother's Day weekend, making a new session with Cory, hystericals. We'll see in these sessions I talk and Cory helps him figure out appropriate responses to some of the new experience he questions. At this turn, making to wrap it. Let me know what would happen to him. and died. We gave the answer to the clinical supposed to solve a sparmine that I'm healthy about how you write the law because I was supposed to not to worry. For a preschooler that was supposed to do, but it called us on the carpet. Daddy did all those things too. It wasn't supposed to make that, they did book say so. And then he said, mommy, if you don't know, I'd be in the house all by myself. He'd make dim things home of the school. We explained them at Paris for two currants and the engine too yet another month. But it takes a long time to get the Chicago for me, and I was going to go on the way. You take care of me until they got me. Because the plan for me, home plans seems to help me. So, in a moment of inspiration, courage took out a picture of me from my wallet. Anna, she wrote specific instructions there. In an emergency, Paul is babysitter Amber to cure a neck, on his grandfathers' dress from Ohio. Just having that little card in the hall that it explained, allowing the left-hand fear to be. You don't know what caused you to be seen. You could be a top son, you could be a long-sadam head injury, a couple of times. We try to pack bottles from mission robots to Christmas on the next one. One bucket map, and all that's scared. This is no celebrity house. This is a user. There's very little money to vote for research. So, some doing this to a friend. What I always say that people understand this little last name, but maybe some will take notice and start with me to want to be on this term on disease before my kingdom turns through. You might think it's not that contrary in the house. It's not. Actually we're doing that too. This month, the depression, the pain of the house, the first problem that training is. It was over a certain moment. At night, the same was spoken to in the process of sleeping. It's about having a father from where nothing was done. No one's  this from the school's one. It's cut along the day. Since I've taken over, it's become the time to talk about job, about everything. I'm busy. So, for the past two weeks, we'll have to come into the next one. Do you think daily when day is over? Or is it really going to be this? Oh, yeah. You think she's eating? I don't have her. That's a great time to me. It's interesting. You're static again. Really? It is me being too easy. But what if you buy me? Can you do it? Sanna's person looks full white food. Some food a cry when his name is engraved on him. He said yes, he did. He used to cry about him. He told him that I didn't, that right after someone dies, he didn't kind of laugh, but after a while, he stopped him. He didn't just feel working out, he got to know and know that person, so so much. He thought about that for a while, taking a moment. What did he say? Why would he stop crying? You must have a better feeling than we have a beard that you have so so much that you really need. So you remember you can, and that's what we stuck in. I think you're stuck in the middle for how to green it, so we can't stick with you. So it's okay to be sad and cry. And maybe to keep it in the final step and you too. And then you'll go, oh, oh, oh, oh. November 1949, October 13 benutters Thursday.
