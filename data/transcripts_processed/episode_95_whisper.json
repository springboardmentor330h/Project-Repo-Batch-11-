And it wasn't just the going the main thing is to understand what the made that happened. Around the time of the Winsby Storybroke, Ray Rummer, Governor of Colorado, ahead of the Democratic Party, publicly declared that for 16 years had a relationship outside his marriage. The name DJ Thorne Dern. , the press that is wife and family knew about the relationship in the big section. Any argued in his press conference that might be helpful to talk about what really happens in marriages. Sir Beraul. of what we used to live in. The NI have been married 45 years. Is there a 45-year? And it's a very strong relationship. Solid. In the course of 45 years, in many marriages of this country, different attitudes developed in America. About 50% of them end up in the board. They can't work at that. When those two. Remainment rate. There's still our times in which there are different feelings and different relations. All of it, please, I think, have these kinds of problems for time to time the animal and differently. All of you listen carefully. All of you listen carefully. I'm trying to live out a life based upon what I truly believe and truly value. Now often times, this is how I call norms of fully accommodate the way I see it. I have to work that out. I'm trying to say, I have conducted myself to my wife, to my children and to DJ in a way which I try to be very honest and open and true to what I felt and believe. Here is the window of discussion that's being opened up right now in our country. It came up with Roy Braummer, came up with Bill Clinton before him. And I asked you to do with Monarch Me. I have to think about it. In a magazine called Critical Inquiry, a Northwestern University professor named Lara Kiffinison, in case there are a lot of marriages where people are simply unhappy. And these people are workers who are alienated in their job. jobs, no, going nowhere. , we told these days that we're supposed to work at marriage, the way that we're supposed to work at a job. So you work your job and you work at home. What do you get? And for these people in a building marriage, she says, having an affair is  a wild head strike. It's action, civil action, small attempt at altering the business as usual of their own lives. All enormous of people, he or the ones that you have to subscribe to him with. up to don't work a lot of people. And I think that's so interesting about politician adultery. Is that everybody's very moral punitive about it or that's kind of the usual way of talking about it. But nobody really talks about why are these guys risking their careers and having these affairs and  these guys who are supposed to be so sad to question what it will be and he would say. What? What I guess what I'm saying is that one people are crawling around for ways to somehow prove the quality of life. People feel in one case that there's someone that getting what they should be getting that normal life and the couple form. It just doesn't deliver what it's post. It doesn't cover everything. It doesn't work. It doesn't, , me. people have. I know that sounds a little bit now. I mean, it doesn't seem to say, but I guess I think happiness is a pretty big question. And it's one that there are just a few ways of talking about. And I think that's what's so interesting about what's going on. And now, because it's opening up this way to talk about things that are just never talked about, what would it be  if political politicians talk about, who is fabric of people's death? what it would take to be happy, what it would take to be fulfilled. Just the summer night. I was trying to describe life as a greening happens to the families. And when you're in political life, there is such a hot spring of focus on you. But you really do not have opportunities to say, there are a tough and vigorous things you have to describe. Most of us I think have very hesitant to believe that any kind of non-monogging switch to the world. And very remember to not have any depressed problems. Since  in Europe, the professional Paul, the glad hand from the word of sound bites and fundraising dinners, found themselves theorizing publicly about trust, and love, and what marriage is. You see this? the issue? What is the deal of? The reality is what kind of openness you have, what kind of trust you have, which is based upon truth and openness. And so, , in my own family, we discussed that in some way, and we have tried to arrive at an understanding of what our feelings are, our needs are, and we're going to work with that kind of fidelity. Welcome to BB EZCH Paggo, in the global video international, it's a American life from my request. Today on our program, we're not being in this distance, stories people struggle to redefine and understand the values. And what we should make please add hotness to the Germans today. Today we are at a case examples, act one, scientific experiment, story of a couple, we've got a question another man and how they treat it in English. channel of crushing demons and what happens when you apply rational ideas irrational feelings pet two love and happiness dance savage talks to real non monotonous couples it's  whether they're actually happy and why it might be okay to see other partners but only it happens in other time zones actually Istanbul Ian Brown talks about the experience that most of us have struggling to stay monotonous and what we should be你说 you say would Back one. It's scientific experiment. Well, the essential question of monogamy is what to do with feelings that you may find that you have for someone else. You're at a couple. You can still have them spouts and you can just crush, get ignored, magnize or you can act on it and magnize. This is straight a couple, so very increase. The white crisp got a crush on another man. and there has been soldiers just to the chief term for a question to do a kind of art project, a writing project that they would do together. We do it then put out a magazine called semi-attacks and we thought maybe he'd write it in a magazine or somewhere else. But a crush is a pal, a rational thing though, trying to contain within an art project, in the monotonin is not so easy. Here's what happens. We started. One evening, evening  a nearer, which we spent as a couple, in the same friend, actually a summer-to-day sushi company. We just had dinner and restaurant, and we have to have dinner and dinner. Going to have a dinner this place. Well, at dinner, I noticed that it's making night on the table. and it went in the evening, he loved it with where I was dressed with Medi-Chapah was a twice before and he said, look, you're really really come out, come out and something. Anyway, it was very strong, it was very sick. It was , Dick and I were speaking a secret language in the place of there. It was a little bit too long, it was quite a long drive, food and mountains and down. desert in 1912, until we reached this house which was in the last house in New York. It was in Desert Town and really the last stop before nowhere. And we had a evening together which was a fun to put in nice and we could be with some drinks and listen to music and so on and fix the video. Towards one of these evening that turns to be  morning. Check by this video. the heat made that was commissioned by English public television. I himself dressed as Johnny Cash, writing his his voice into the heart of darkness, and talking about earthquakes and longing to spare. And it was then that I felt totally involved with Dick. Watching him dressed as Johnny Cash? Yeah. I was not quite aware that there was anything happening to him, Dick and Chris and I he was not much at the 16th night. and then went to the earth. This temple of the better took part in the morning, me and Sauri are in the self-added living room, decking his bedroom on the other side of the wall, which I promised. And all that long, I found myself dreaming that I moved across the world of the day. And in the morning, we are in a kind of extended source in the morning. And the creature was gone, crystal and strategizing in relation to him. Before realizing... And this word was down... and that was the main soft-fulous peach. So, what do you think? Or an extended start? Hi! We laughed. I went and had breathed the eye hop on well and I couldn't stop walking off. We talked about all these things and things and goes right ahead and I guess I guess I paid attention to them but they didn't pay special attention to their confidence and the need for real and the need for treatment and the more. We weren't really very exceptional at that point in our relationship at more and the way that we often said it's been a lot of sex which we can struggle. and we tell each other everything. That's all. You should know. So I told everyone everything happened to me that night. Everything was on my mind. And we couldn't stop talking about it. And all the way down, we kept talking about what happened last night. Last night, I met the two. I mean, she crisis pressures when she was in the world. When this is, you used to capital against the... You talked about it. You asked me back into the explorating, that it's passion. I was born. So I went to Silver and I was also there watching a duo. She might do. Maybe I should write a letter. And so there's a guess of course that's a great idea. I think you should write a letter. I'll help you. Let's get the computer. Let's set it up right now. We'll write a letter. I thought you're too young. Seeing me somewhere… a song was left in front of the bag. project was tuning into something we continue together. See, I decided from beginning, wasn't going to be a challenge. Because I've been through that, and I didn't have any experience in the way to say, in which I'm talking to people, I never agree with myself in the same way. Jadis, although I recognize the emotions, which is very powerful. And so you started writing that is a new word to person. I would just let her in this, because I knew too much better. I'd  to... the idea   him the name of the kingdom. It's a terrible personal. And so there was a good letter, but it wasn't enough. And when so there finished his letter, I knew that there were things I could add. And his letter probably could be the right moment. So I wrote my first letter. And then so there was a very critic of my first letter. He said this is a wrong, you can better. But we both sat down to write this. So there's a second letter and my second letter. And the notion from the great beginning was that you write the letters but you would not send them. No, I think the notion at the very beginning was that we would send them. But after you've written your first draft in the second draft and then it's third and fourth, fifth letter. And you have a stack of letters in fact after three days. We had maybe eight pages of letters which is a deep peeking at the passing of the second letter. What first of all, the way we wrote the letter was a essential thing because they are dealing with not to write letters and we pose, , thinking back to words, we both have a computer, a city, in front of each other, and basically dictating the letter to the other person. Okay, this is from the first letter that I met in the past  California, December 9, for your death. I couldn't talk and hung up on the bottom end of romantic engagement, beating heart and sweat of problems. It's incredible for the others family. For 10 years, my life has been organized around the world with the meaningful element of this day. So there, whose typing this says this letter, right, the point. What we are actually on our way to the end. He says, I'm squashing at all the current rules of things in the center of the country. But take, I know that it should read this. You'll know this letter. Being in love with you, being ready to take this ride, making bills to speak, hunched up in a letter jacket for corner of my friends. At times, it's that not giving a f*** or seeing all the consequences loaning things I can't do anymore. So here, thanks for that command, that he's not. I love you. Prince. most of the letters take one of real letters, but this is very interesting, it takes the form of dialogue. Do you want me to read that? Yeah, this is the dialogue which we , the Sinha connectivity. Yeah, each of us type in from the type in the Chris Silvia, this is  the Institute of the Emotion Research. Silvia, the only way we can be captured and you're feeling is maybe looking big, this is our imaginary friends. So when do we meet that? It's so mixed up. At times we reach these peaks of real possessionities, explains, but through it we are able to see him or clearly see me be with himself. Chris, don't be so presumptuous. We keep talking about day because he was your little brother. You think you have his number? See game? Well, I don't have to seem taken in his judo. Chris, I don't have to take. I mean love is him. See game. It's so unfair. See you on Shaean. What does he have to be drilled with? Edge opened a shy bed. No, no. So, as you wrote, this adult is just a ci from mostly time, and you, you were reading in letters, origin Chris, not graph then erogin. Well, it all depends. Say, I think what happened? that I got involved in the project. And when you go to intense about it, it has started being anxious about it and upset. But when somehow the project became illusive, we were beginning to lose the thread, then somehow we should get back into it. Because I guess because we form of community, we should form of being together. Because we will be experiencing a game together. We have a logical game. The challenge has been game. I mean, do you go as part of what writing letters about this trying to keep this feeling, this transgressive feeling, this crush, and then within the bounds of your marriage values? , we never said to ourselves, , we're going to write letters because we don't want to transgress the depth. of a marriage. We never said that the certain points. Sleveran, I'd love to be each other and said, this is the closest we've been years. We're having more fun together, , having this adventure writing these letters being in love with the third person. Then we've had an entire marriage. , what's threatening to cherish a part of the fact we're almost having a boyfriend together unite against someone attended. So very healthy please love me. While this corresponds to the skyhine the way that you have never been a muffin before. , our connection should be very intellectual, very professional, but it never been a grand passion, great mom. And I really felt glad about the mom. So one of the things that happened to me, to the Zaginianism process, sex life, which is one of the good things is going to happen now to bad work, less and bad work. And at the very last phase of this dual correspondence to Dick, the insolver writing letters to Dick, we read our house and upstate, we worked. And we decided that our lives were a lot  Charles and Emma Boebe, who was trapped in problems. So they are decided to come to our company. So you are a letter to death as a child for a boy. I am taking him from the fact he and I started on the same thing. Sirman, you are January 2019. First, dear Dick, this is Charles Boerry. Emma and I have been leading together for some nine years. Even though it was with these materials, the passion can't stand in this ten minutes. of sex became short in somewhat wobbling. We had sex rarely, it ended in didn't matter. A lot of increasing sex was sublimated to more worthy social networks, aren't means comforting. Still occasioned the troubling thought surface that a couple with that sex is hardly a couple in the top. That this point definitely. After we convince ourselves that the life without sex was a better life, that you entered our life,  an angel of mercy. M.S. is having elsewhere enabled me to regain desire. How it happened when it is miracle. Which we turned suddenly about to be to go, the spirit of sense. one of these little Romani guards touching every part of my body, the rather than the secondness of pleasure. As if the veil had lifted in the new field of viewing personality vivid. I didn't get this letter to you, Dick, is all mine. Love, triumph. Do you think that silver had any feelings of jealousy? Well, of course you do. I mean, how did this happen in silver not be jealous? But, , silver is very useful and reflective, of course. So, as these emotions start to come up with jealousy. He looks at me so well. That really the way I want to feel. That's the way I want to handle this. That person I want to be says, well. So then he looks around from another angle. what angle? What position can you take? That would have worked out? Because jealous is really to be the jealous. How could you start to improve? Yes, the way moments we have developed. I feel dumped and felt betrayed. I felt was going to fall and you're not going to get back to her. The first step is to keep writing up but it's a bit too difficult. The experiment in any of your feelings in a rational vocabulary project was in fact a nation of humans so they can be sad she says it's  something process. They can never write back she bought deeper and deeper and more. She started to reflect on her marriage, and she became an appendix to Silver. As she no longer had a separate wife, separate identity. She was resentful. He became a woman person, and he met always in control. And of course, the marriage would be the same for the marriage. Broke? After months of writing these letters to Dick, it became impossible for me to continue living in Silver. Well, how? Explain that. Well, okay. Things change. Very tough. because at the end of the first round of letters after we've written about 200 pages together, I actually gave them to get who were out in California and I thought we did it with get. And I can say, you can tell me what you did. Well, did you gobspomper, believe? What did these singers do? No, you see, Dick had said something to me pretty early on in the corresponds, said, right now I'm at a point in my life, right here in the what it's , and then. to say yes to him. So, decided not to say no to my project. He didn't give me that courage. He didn't participate in it. But he never said no. He never said stop. We had a house in Upstates in Europe and I moved up there alone at winter. She'd be alone to write to death. And I called it and I told him that I love my husband. He never said stop. I was  the same, but I cannot spend waking. But he said, what? I was all about saying, how? When she actually met Dick, it was out of my mind. So... Well, I had lunch, but I was , I got to play six. I get that as a first thing. night. It's raining. I was terribly nervous that change closed two of your times on the plane in rental par office and that's Dick's house. He used there and I saw him play basketball and he was deep in the office, creating papers and I'm not going to join him at the end. He probably would be very light when I saw him cheat from the tree. I'm happy to see him play basketball. And very soon the conversation went down to the last minute. Why are you speaking? He started to talk. He said, I think he did not understand. He started screaming. But no, we've had you at the evening. It's talk on the phone while it's in place. Can you project the sh**k of the kid-nath and you stop him? They think with your games and I don't want it, I never asked him. I think you even said that. I didn't know what the kid had since played the monster. Except for the evil and said part for it, and do you see why he would say, you don't know why I'm the monster, but before I was still in the financial crisis. Well, I mean, yes, I suppose I said level he had his point. He had his point. But he was so resolute and thought it could be good. I mean there was a definite turning moment where he just decided to play things. I asked him if he wanted to see me. I said yes, I did absolutely. And he started to think he was my works. And then he said, well, I'm sorry, I'm a friend. I'm a week. And he made the strands on the cross-and-long again in the American and down. I'm going to listen when he saw that I was disappointed. He jumped on me and said, what's the matter? Did I burst your balloon to try the fantasy? I'm going to listen to the fantasy. It's a very, , one way to read the story. of what happened to his dad. Chris had a crash and by having a ride on his dad, he encouraged my ride on his dad. , unconscious, created a situation that you have all these things to present to their, and he would reject. Maybe you're writing a sense that we started writing, both of us started writing letters, making it very difficult for him to have a position tove not know if he's really worried, to have situations  that, and to store things  that before ceasing it. To grateful them our distress. Today, you need to realize that life can be a miracle or not discard one and let's真的 your number of problems. We're on the guide path to Buddha densely life. happen between human women, to also hold marriage, it was coming down in the leaves. That's what you mean. And I think it's right. And I guess it was something I'd  to remind you, as long as we made it to project and we were together. Let's start in such a way that may have made it impossible to return to the planet of Sharia and to the future. Just start with the subject. Music current enters the relationship is always low it's alwaysIRE the to all lan regenerates And I'm not arriving at once. once in a row, sometimes more than 10 years. It's been time to get to the individual movement. Most often, if you're right, use the image, we manage a guess at the moment for the first two. To keep this closeness in spite of other movements in two years, some of them may be final. We don't know. It's a game of shaky position, in the same 13. You get carried away in the situation, so you should know it in the different 13 different situations. So we're whisking with there and something that's going to happen in the kitchen. Dr. Havana Gondon is experienced together and I mean at every moment really we were in it together in all of my cave hall of his cave we were there together. He's been having a great beer. After going from that well it just seemed inevitable to us. One layer another we will be intimately connected. We will be responsible for the rest of our lives. When you think about this experience, what do you think? What is the signal engine? Well, I learned that we have to pay for indulgence. Some level towards the signal engine, which was a project, which was a rescue operation. It was also... playing his fine. I think the thing that the must-beasts in front of me in that environment is we just don't want to have to close my hours. I know, but I guess if you've been through the jealousy to the extent that I have been, I'm sure other people have been and you learn from it and what you learn is that. they are  ways of avoiding it. You want to do ways, isn't that? Try to imagine what the other person is to be in time, not to have images to focus in that. And you realize that the partner can very well have a life and you didn't have to take it to them as something that's it concerns you. She concerns the person. It's not done to do you harm, it's not done to be sure you're the same because the other person is the life. I mean the whole question. Thank you for this. Good. that it seems so, I don't know, small, compared to loyalty in a lifetime commitment to what a person. So, if you're a luxury during the Chris Kraus, she'd likely do letters, plus some count what happened in a book called I Love Dick. How'd you The beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bonds.

In and in. From public radio international. We're not from the kitchen. uhm Des characteristic of a kind of yeah all in feel the been into thats this American guy from America last, each of the courseages of the theme that variety of varieties of farmers and other people to come on and tell stories on that thing today's program. Not in the insistence. People struggling with not me. Grasping for alternatives. We've reached the second active by program, active, loving happiness. I think for most of us our first reaction when we hear about non-monotonous collegies, a couple of symptoms. Is that crazy feeling? We need to hear about some designs that you would not. one to ever be your own. How can these people possibly be? In this act, Dan Savage explains. The warning before he begins talks about sex in this story, nothing is possible. Graphic but essentially. The apologies to Leo Tolstoy. The Nogamous couples are all alike. Each Nogmonog is a couple. He's a Nogmonogamous. Which is their way. For a Nogmonogamous arrangement to function properly, we mean that blood new tears. Both persons. involved have to agree on a set of rules. The rules of menogging are pretty simple in the straight forward. After you've said honey, let's not have sex with other people, let's left to discuss. But functional non-menogging, for having sex with persons other than your partner, with your partner's foreign knowledge and consent, well that sort of narration requires some don't-get negotiation. But it's okay with you for your partner to have sex with other people, does that mean it's okay for your partner to have sex with other people under any circumstances? In the bad news share? with your best friend, probably not, enough to have a little sleep. The rules vary from cup to cupble. I've heard couples who weren't allowed to sleep with each others' friends or with your exes, not in our apartment house beds, or in one. I've been in three nom nomging situations, in one we could sleep with other people as long as we were in the same time. In another outsideing. encounters were limited to a certain few and various specific sex acts that, or a certain few and various reasons we didn't enjoy doing together. One straight couple I recently learned about is a rule that requires them to lie to me to learn. Not just lie, but lie convincing. The idea seems to be that it's okay if they sleep with the people, they're just not allowed to make the other person feel bad by actually letting them know. Clumsy lie would be as bad as talent. I interviewed one woman, he said, I'm not. The rules are very joking. The rules were mostly centered around making sure that nobody gotten involved with somebody who's better than Chris Mirall's arch involved with. So, , I wouldn't want him to have sex with someone who is terribly sexy or smart or witty or funny . So nobody's sexier, smarter, witty or funier than you. No, they all had to be a little bit late. the rules are. seem to fall into three broad categories, who you can have sex with under what services, and what you can tell your partner about it. It's that third set of rules that are distanced. How much do you want to know? If your partner has sex with a tree in a forest and you're not around to hear it, did it actually happen? The woman I interviewed made a non-disclosure pack at the airport. But ultimately they couldn't live up to their don't-ass don't tell a policy. And began sharing her experiences, which resulted in competition. If one got some on the side, the other felt entitled and would go looking for it. Breaking their own Donas don't tell rule was complicating the arrangement, which begs the biggest question of all. Do these nonmonogamous arrangements work? Was this couple happy? Well, it worked and it didn't work. I mean, there was a part of me that felt  being nonmonogamous sort of created this hollow core in the center of the relationship. ,  I really love it. love this person, but I wasn't sure I could trust him as far as I could grow. You didn't fully possess him? I didn't fully possess him, and I think part of it was I didn't want to be fully possessed. Back when she was in her nomadography, she was a straight person, she was a straight person. Her day friends were really supportive, provided her honor of working with well-known ones. nomadogamy is more common than the day companies in the straight or possibly the most. It makes some gay politico's uncomfortable when we were launched this out, but every study long-term male cup. from Stephensbury nurse. Sometimes Scot fraction in skipping form in rules of conversation, so established on non- �זper in audiences in this discussions but what work is that shouldn't have done in the нормально task equipment. and iterations's system. This rule allows for outside encounters, protects both parties, sees polls and reserve and few especially intimate sex acts that the gay couple, whom they want to offer is a share home, a job. Since so many straight people have all, but maybe, can't imagine having sex without intercourse, this rule just would work as well. My friend, Danes, and his car, they didn't want to talk to each other. The rules we set down came about without really speaking for me. This had a friend over and Scott kind of. saucy and we found a bed. Found ourselves goofing around with the third person. And I'm... I very often when gay men talk about these , moving arrangements, first thing. They'll use words, phrases  goofing around, play, and all these sort of  harmless sounding. Whereas, , when straight people talk about it, it's sex, or whatever . One of the things that... One is about gay sex, and I suppose it's very humorous, understanding. He's the... He's the possibility of having sort of , boy scout income rock. or you're just sort of goofing around, you're back to that phrase. So what's, you think that's part of the difference between, absolutely, it truly is goofing around. This smashing, it's making out, it's rolling around. It's got to stay physically, very superficial. As I said earlier, I was in three non-monauting relationships. Past tense all over the moment. And the woman I spoke with earlier is no longer in her non-monauting relationship. Judging from just her in me, I think I'm just her in me. would think non-monautumnist relationships in the last. We be wrong. Dr. Arlene Rubin conducted a single-large study in her non-monautumnist couples to monautumnist ones. Dr. Rubin interviewed 164 couples, half monautumnist, half monautumn, and did follow up in her resume all 164 couples out of five, ten, and ten years. Dr. Rubin discovered that there wasn't a difference. Non-monautumnist couples were just half energies, which were monautumnist ones. The number of couples stayed together, wasn't sad. the same. Namanagmi was no indication of the instable pure mind. Smith, according to Dr. Rubin, whether a couple of monogamous says nothing to do, how long is standing here there? Aven's boyfriend Eric went together for five years and he's still coming strong. What would you say to people who assert that monogamy and relationships in a patient, a serious relationship? But two people are being diagnosed with something strong all take the relationship swells in between first written. is that the number of questions about the Cache for the body to occur in the last month. That's what the first part of that about that Pinoch is, the sign of information. I would say if it's true for you then it's true. That's what the assumption that Pinoch's relationship is inherently less valuable or less committed. I would disagree, just a contact that the conversation is an error client. You don't have to have it. If it is authentic somewhat open relationship. I've brought about a level I never see, we wouldn't have tapped any of the way. Minutes seems  everybody talks about monogamy, something that you do personal muddy else. , that I will be faithful to you because I love you. But I actually came to feel  non-monogamy, something that you do. somebody. You could let them be who they were and still love them and still be committed to them. The other assumption that is often made about non-negocomies that is advanced. A couple may open their relationship on time, they will, series, chart of non-negocons. Dr. Rubin studies to show that this is a true life. A couple she followed all straight and now all in that. It's a bit of a sense of a thousand smarts. Kids, as their marriages went on, these couples pretty much stuck to what they've been doing all along, some time, or not. So it isn't an experiment or things. It's a choice. Dave's, it works for the couples. It works. The insavage rates have indicated sex based on savage love. That's what it is. stranger who's different Seattle. Act 3. Distance ball. So where does the speed? Most of us, the rest of us. Where does it lead those of us who understand what it is that we actually sacrifice to be in an augmas. Adventure. Surprise. But also understand what we would be sacrificing. What difficulties and jellacies we might be. of checking ourselves too . If we were non-monautics, where does the sea bus in Brown in the distance? There's a couple across my street who make love in my living room. I hear them in the evening when I walk after dinner. From the sidewalk I can see cream walls, a mantle drape and animal hides, app and carmelings. The woman makes most of the noise, mid-range, Oath's second apartment. small crystal cups at the open friendship and fun. Passion and disregard for the neighbors. A tremendous combination. The air stops moving, Ram. Is there sex better than my own? I wonder what she looks  when she's morning. Does she love him? Resume you, Zee and Jail on Stir? Or is she there just with a sentence? I can never decide with who to be more exciting. I imagine she's in her 30s and that she has dark air, an ordinary woman who's ordinary chores, whose passion is nonetheless excitely unsuppressed, who we need. But which woman is the owner of the doctor who just had a baby, only now returning to sex? The Mexican girl who works at all the time to get her, for the Chinese cater, woman Blast volume and I'm licensed, girls. Your cries never last more than half in the block. Walking back to my house, I usually have a few bent and bare stops. I think you're a 39-year-old married nurse, dancing front of the nurse listening to an unseen company block. You're sick. And I keep stepping up and hoping to hear that what you do in it. You're a 40-year-old, and you're a 40-year-old, and you're a 40-year-old, my wife was... staff baby and it's not just talk or a plan she inherited and birded fantasizing she used to practice with her girlfriends well I want to have four. Now this is different one system. When would you  to start she said again this one third time week as we read the newspaper of the breakfast. The sun was already bearing down furiously at half past eight and god damn one. I could do the buzz and weed whack in the story. Anytime you  I said no take my hands up the paper. I didn't want to. I'm crazier because the truth is this. Some days I'm for it, but when I'm not for it, I'm really not for it. By Westbody's change, your body overtaken by hormonal committees telling you to get on as grand as Disney's purpose. I can see it in the slight post-marrative widening for hips, no less sexy than the originals but still wider. When she lips away from the bad night upon the blue shins. I can see it in her taste and clothes. She doesn't go any more from the spray-down  her skirt so he's blind. Even in her sexual habits, she has less interest in sex than she is. She wants to make love now, keeps, pausing her for sadness. Last week, as if I magic to baby books appeared in Pilons, war on her side in bed. At the bottom of the pile, but only when I walked into bed room, saw him  her promise I may long gone happily in the house. I went to that name. When did all that happen? I can't remember anything. The dates were a courtship, countless touching things she claims I said there. The best blurred fog decorations. One day I was living my comfortable life for the next shoes living. On a bad day, it makes me nervous to remember on this. On a bad day, when I think about slow jellings. together in this gap and weight and formality. The muscle around my heart closes and my breath comes from rest on the pan. One day she and I were dating and then we were living together and then we bought a house and then we married and then she wanted to have a baby and escalated her commitment so I decided to calm me step. My friends were astonished they said I wasn't the type to marry. The few of them had made that to me. I told them I wanted to find out what lay on the other side. I stole out my own group. I thought I was an adventure, and yet here I stand, and a well-chuned front yard surrounded by neighbors, swing sets, and sport utility vehicles, the moveable monuments of the city, listening to a couple of copying. And across the yards, I see another minute working where I leave back in the room. I mean, exactly the same thing. Just because I married them, practicing what's known as not me. It doesn't mean I don't think but I'm women. Because I do. I still can't drop women from my past. And I still ask myself the question. the question. Every man does. Women have their own brain. The question is the question you ask yourself. Every time you see a woman on the street. It's a question. Every single time no matter who she is, whole she is no matter how attractive she is or is. And the question is, would I sleep with her or how about her? Not real I sleep or how can I sleep or even could I sleep with her? The question is, would I? But even though I always ask the question I don't act with her, because I'm trying to be nodding. That's why I'm nodding has such a bad grip. reputation. It's boring. The noggin is the habit of not acting on what you want. I even hate the word itself. Sounds so stane, so foolish, more. The noggin,  a board game, your approximation, sighting. Sometimes, of course, I hear about open marriages. You and Hattin won the star to Hattin won the end of the Dickens Floyd. I hear about open marriages and they seem  some fabulous exotic city that I've always wanted. and to visit they never seem to get to. Istanbul, open marriages are  Istanbul. Some ancient mysterious plays where there are minirats, strange music, where one entire civilization suddenly ends and a whole new stranger one begins. Only religion even, the mysterious ease. I've always wanted to go to Istanbul. most couples my wife and I sometimes talk about open marriage. Well, nice that we talk about it. It'd be more accurate to say the subject comes up and media lies down in. We'll be lying in bed and the dark talking about our lines, that what we  in what we miss in that quiet pleasant way you do when you're trying to be in your own mind. Then my wife will say in the dark. , if you ever have sex. So when else I'm passing, playing, I don't want you to tell me about me. And I say really. I say really, because I don't know what else to say. If I say, okay honey, that's fine with me. She'll say, what are you thinking about it? And I'll have to say, of course not. Even if I am, so I say really, or I'll say something non-committable. Don't worry. Whatever I say, a few minutes ago. And then she always says, still remember the dark. But I don't want you to sleep with someone else anyway. Okay. Nice, then. Okay. That's a kind of conversation you have when you agreed to be in the audience. I don't want to sleep with anyone else, or to be more exact. I'd  to, but I really don't have the Constitution for him to doubt him. will have for help and marriage or guilt. But I'll give me maybe boring, but the alternatives take up a lot more time and energy. When I hear stories about the president and I think he must have an arrangement with Hillary, I think, G. That was great. But some part of me also feels...not disappointed. Not more re-out ranged. Nothing that, wow, sharp and pompous. But sad. Not so word. Sad. I am not sure I know why. I'm not even sure I know why I am trying to stay in the darkness. Why have I chosen this route for the app? I don't pretend it has anything to do with more standards. In fact, I suspect it comes down to something my wife wants to say. We were having one of our conversational menu ads in the dark, one of our gentlemen that ever said, don't chat, it's about faith in us. My wife said that the only thing she missed is not this woman. they seem to be speaking. And I was , was news, new bodies, new heads, new sets. I said, I knew you meant. And I said, but isn't that kind of sad? I mean, if you go through your whole life, 20, 30, 40, 60 years of marriage without ever spraying, you do that. You never get to know what it's  to be unfaith. You never get to know what it feels  to be emotionally ill-eat. And that's new. important feeling, one of the great human themes after all. A whole constellation of humanity you'll never know. My wife is quiet and long time. I could hear the bridge and the stings. In the street  coming to the curtains I could just see her out of her. I thought myself, I've spent long time in this bed. Yes, my wife said then, that's true. But if you do sleep you'll never know what is. to be faithful to one person your whole man, which might also be an important constellation of him in. It's just a touch of sarcasm in this. And then it was my turn to lie in dark for a long time. I'd never considered monogamy as an adventure. I thought it was, well, domestic problem. We're no international borders of France. But monogamy isn't a adventure and in some ways, it won't. mysterious one that open marriage, because trying to be faithful to one person is a trip that takes time. And you never really know if you're getting close, or if you've reached the destination. You never really know when you've arrived. For my generation, the first one that is soon free love for both sexes, first. For us, monogamy is the last sexual mystery under the Great Unhout. We've tried it, and now it's. It certainly. different kind of ship than open memory which has lots of stops long and long way. The most of them are the same. Maybe that's the problem though marriage not many surprises. It's titillating but not very mysterious. Maybe that's why hearing about open marriages always makes me feel sad by the zones of the river to feed them something  that. Okay then do what I thought about that dream used to be faith in the whole thing. I thought, it's a sweet dream. Almost  an ideal. And I knew I didn't want to be the one who proved to be the truth. It scared me too, I want responsibility to be the truth. It's not such a wise thing in the arms. Anyway, I'm trying to be the non-s. Maybe not even for myself. Maybe I'm just doing it. It's not that I don't want to go to Istanbul anymore. But I really want to. In fact, I think about Istanbul all the time. If only to remind myself that it's still there, it's just it. There's this other place I want to get to first. Little power meant for the longest time. I never even used them.
