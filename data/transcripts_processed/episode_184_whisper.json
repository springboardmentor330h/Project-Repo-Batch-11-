  "text": "Back in 1991, Diane's father, Arnold Abbott, started a charity helping the homeless. We gave up  it and she was served 1100 meals a week, a couple of good jobs, a public charity of the 9th neighborhood. Who was later, he was contacted by a woman in Michigan in Katherine Sims, who was in the screen, this was there, called a love, your neighbor. She has a cable access show that's on the time to trade and pretend she had reticies in USA today. She's also T-shirts and bracelets. She'd actually trademarked the name Love Your Neighbor as the name of her business ministry. Love, the eye neighbor just seemed to close to Love Your Neighbor to her. People might want to donate to her, but then gave them money to him instead. She tried to convince them to change the name. First, probably. Now, she's so angry. The band is a nice station. These issues in the name of the neighbor turn it over to her and turn over all profits as made. Wait, she wanted profits to do all the money I made to that. Take money away. for the safety. At this point, I had to hire an attorney and the attorney Michigan to represent us. I had to send a retainer of $5,000. It's translates into, well, the 13,000 meals that I'm almost in my house to, but together, beautiful meals with about 38 cents. Well, that's what you have. Right now, it's picking honey out of the food up. as a mother's home. She's kind of a lost. She herself is religious. Does follow the priest up to Jesus Christ and she is trying to do God's work. Following from various drawings to group. Captain Sims wouldn't talk to us Julie Greenberg is her attorney. She points out that US trademark law requires anybody who holds a trademark on a name. You go and fight off other people who try to use the same name even if it's a homeless shelter. The child she really is the answer to seven people. First come today. Big luck to announce that you become the deportable Madam of aropriety 78 January September. I feel this is a minimum salary of 500 dollars. Your salary is to accommodate 15,265 million dollars to routine and you get a� forう in October. Ability. I honestly get my salary for 10,2550 dollars. The total $2550 not too hard to hack towns. 6,080 people on a budget of $50,000 a year. Straight mark law, the only real issue who used it for general. And in this case, Reverend Simfuse did quite 10 years first. So, when did Reverend Simfuse use? 1982. If you're opponent in this case, if the charity loved by neighbor Dunn's Florida, were to employ the principal, loved by neighbor as they sell. And your view, what would they do? He's causing trademark infringement by using this particular choice of words, take any other word, any other words, don't cause excuse him. Everybody would be that wrong. But if the idea of the principle is that you treat your neighbor as you would be treated, the way that she would want to be treated is that he would give up the name. Why doesn't she just give up the name? Well, because she has hard questions. I don't think any doctrine of either biblical or civil law requires to give up something a value of going to happen. Both sides of this dispute claim that they are only trying to love their neighbor. Each side prays to the same God, quotes the same Bible. Neither side one in a result is astonishing as a lawsuit but the lawsuit thing. They and our show. People who think that they are good people, good neighbors. When ended up doing the least nape of e things possible. WB-easy Chicago, a public radio or a national, a numeric in life, America Glass. We bring you three stories today of three neighborhoods, Ka-Kwan, Mr. Rockbarts in neighborhood, that act as a story from a few years back in which an average hot-going decides to appeal the disputes and problems in his neighborhood to a higher authority. Mr. Rogers, yes, that Mr. Rogers. Two little girl next door. So anabric kid wants to defend you, walks to you, presents, hangs around. What if you don't want a very young new friend? A crey, the Batman, the comic, the story of a close-knit neighborhood, people who only want the best for all concern, and coming from the house of a favorite neighbor, dozens and dozens of rats, and there is nothing they can do about it. Stay with us, my friend. I won Mr. Rothbard's name. David Rothbard lives on Chicago's west side, but our story with him today really begins before he knew any of his current neighbors. Back on ago, and he had one special name. When we were kids, my brother Mike wrote a letter to Mr. Rogers. My brother was six. I was three. On a recent show, a deaf woman paid Mr. Rogers' neighborhood of visit. And my brother wanted to tell Mr. Rogers about our mom, because she's deaf too. A few weeks later, I'm a little depressed to my computer and my allies. There was a letter for Fred Rogers. My whole family was pretty excited. My growth to Mr. Rogers again, they began a little correspondence. The next summer, my family was headed to Massachusetts for a week's vacation. Mr. Rogers invited all of us to chill with him for a day. At his summer home on Nantar, get island. Here's what I remember. A long, long car trip. So, next is right on the green big ferry boat. And then we were clattering down a gravel road and my mom said, there's Mr. Rogers house, knocked on his door, there he was. Where we remember it, Mr. Rogers had in this house the entire set, the neighborhood of McLeod. King Friday was there, ladyly, extra all, Daniel Stripe Tiger. We played way past dinner time and into the night. I can't time a grown-up now, but I have grown-up. And there's some things about that visit with Mr. Rogers that just don't quite make sense to me now. I mean, why would a guy even Mr. Rogers interrupt his vacation to hang out with a couple kids? Were we the only kids he never invited to visit him or was a standard practice? And what was up with the whole neighborhood of make believe in his house? Can that really be true? I wanted to see Mr. Rogers again and ask some of these questions. So, the day before my 26th birthday, this American life produced a Alex Bloomberg and I flew to Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers home. town for another visit. We got picked up at the airport by its PR director. God name David Nuel. You might know him as Mr. McFeely. The mailman I'm so. One speedy delivery later. We're in the same room with Surad. This is how you name Surad was driving. Hi. We just see you on Glantys scene after all these years. It's been a while. I should see. But the last time I saw you were holding you could hold you could lift me up in the arms. I don't know if that would be possible to have. I can try. How's your mom? She's doing real well. It's taken six months to arrange this meeting. Mr. Rogers is an incredibly busy man, and his staff, though they're kind and well-meaning, is protective of his time. We've been some debate about where we meet with Fred. We finally settled on the WQED studios. Mr. Rogers has filmed his show for the last 30 years, because as his chief assistant told me, obviously, a beautiful fantasy… Welcome to this neighborhood. Oh, is this? This is me visiting you on the entire circuit. I saw Fred the pictures of my family visiting him when I was four. One of them he's in Peacecodes, holding me in his arms, my parents on the other side. I asked him what he remembers about our visit, but it was a long time ago. He's met thousands of kids since then. And I wish to play the sad. the few members me specifically or what we did that day. But ordinarily I would play and ask the children to see it. It's a beautiful day. No. And now and sometimes I would ask children, I don't would ask you, but I would ask them if they could recognize different characters from the neighborhood of my school. And so I remember, I remember us. I Remember, I thought, what does Kipi write? I remember being the entire set of the land that make believe at your in here in this building, in this picture. But they didn't have the all the set and the cast and everything, but just affected the purpose we're probably there. I'm not a V. I'm a sound of them, put a foot of their. I'm your beautiful meow. I'm your Henry at a meow, I'm your cat. Now that's Henry at a pussy cat. I'm X the owl, I was just flying around looking for all at you. Hey, welcome to this neighborhood. Up till now, I've never interviewed a dude who punctuates his points by pulling puppets out of a little Jim Bang and talking in the voice of an owl. But with Mr. Rogers, it doesn't seem weird. Turns to the sky as president's acting, the strength of it. When you talk with him, he's utterly engaged. He asked a lot of questions, and he seems to actually care about what you say. Let's go. this feelings come right to the surface. I've never been around someone who's both so vulnerable and so fearless about showing who he is. Still playing pretend with him. Sometimes he's just done what to say. There was Daniel Stripe Tiger that finally tripped me up. Listen for when I lose it. I'm still pretty shy. Hi Daniel. Hi. How are you? Good to meet you. Thanks and this one Stripe. Mine is also a Gege. I wonder who could stretch. Oh and you have that too. Oh boy. that it was so good. I was a factory reject. What did you read that then? You look alright to me. The thing is I never looked  a fierce tiger and hardly any tiger lives in the clock. But that's who I am and after a while if you get to know me, you probably accept me exactly as I am. I accept you. I think this is one of the sort. When I told people on my neighborhood I was going out to visit Mr. Rogers. They kept wondering the same thing. What would Mr. Rogers do if he had to deal with the problems in iron neighborhood? Pretty good to talk to me about what goes on there. Share his thoughts. So come with me, want you to my neighborhood, a very special place I call the 1800 block of West Augusta Our first stop, Julie, who doesn't  the loud music from the front below? Get the broom, go up in a choice, and I come out in a apartment, on the floor. Give me a shout, shout me out with that song. Okay, the truth is loud downstairs neighbor, come to me. Just a few little... Well, David,  it wasn't just a few. That's a leading question you're leading to witness. It can be more of a music as we get to end out of music. They only done this twice. I've only done it twice. Have a nice time. Actually, we are remembered. They were banging on the floor a couple nights a week from month. Fun! only one night I went upstairs, acting all innocent. Look, what's going on up here? We're trying to get some rest out of series, but this is custom every sound. Is everything all right? Think I had Julius Husband Greg kind of discombobulated. He was , I think that's my wife. The music? The turf war actually began the first day my roommate and I moved in. We play music, Julie would send Greg to knock on our door, or sometimes just bang that broom on the floor. We eventually worked out it. quite hours to start at the 10pm. But still, sometimes we'd have friends over and yeah, we'd play our music anyways. Me and my roommate, we both figured Julie was crazy. And actually, we kind of felt sorry for Greg, but I guess our music was pretty rough. if you're being tortured in a prison camp, , they do something to you and I have to wire , oh, stop the madness. And it was just the bass sound, , just kind of a thumb thing sounding , I don't know why I just drove me insane. And so when it was a little bit Greg, when you didn't be able to hear it, I'd go, oh my god, you hear it. Let's check back game with your Rogers for a quick second. Here's his take on piece. Good for you, Jolly. Hi. Hey, you're taking her. You're taking her sense. You haven't even heard the whole story. Oh, okay. Well, no, that is the whole story. Okay, you're on her side. What, but, but, but, friend. It's, it's my space. Can't I listen live music in my space. I was wrong with that, but you can, but you can put your front or head front on. Silence, restarted with silence, and I will always uphold a person's right to silence. But I'm super sensitive about this term. I am so sensitive that sometimes I was in Florida not too long ago, and the traffic was so loud that I slept in the closet. took the cushions from couch and made a bed in the closet. That's what I just suggested, Julie. Go into the closet. Exactly. I have a feeling you're getting to know Julie that. And you want you to know her, then either your music is going to bother her so much, or you're going to care so much about. or it should probably turn it down a couple of notches. How do  that? Mr. Riders are broken down perp. That's exactly what's happening between the Injuley. When I'm fighting over music anymore. I think for a lot of people, the only way they come in contact with their neighbors is to conflict. I might not have even gotten a no-gragin juley if she wasn't always thanking them before. But... While the three of us were hanging out that night in their apartment, they told me a story that at the time I didn't pay any attention to, but later made me see something. There's an invisible architecture that links together the folks who share a neighborhood. Greg and Julie were talking about our land ladies dog. Not the one she has now, but her old dog, who wanted to disappear, serious. Greg and the inside scoop in the land. I had asked her what had happened to the dog and she said, she let it out and somebody stole it. , know it. Nobody would. It's the one that God. Now he is so on that dog that dog is so old. It was in the beginning. What is that word when you can't in the continent? A few days later I ran into my neighbor from across the street. , guy who makes his living fixing cars. Not in a shop. Just lines him up by the curb in front of his apartment. And my landlady's dog came up again. I don't know where. We were just BS and about something totally different. to me a neighbor is a friend  family but there's some people that try to be nice they don't they don't appreciate it  the land lady from here. See your cute new one day of the feeling of dog. It sounds a little funny but it's true and the dog was just about as old as she is. What would I want to tell what that one? He was so old and couldn't even hide he walked or see. Mike's a good guy. He's  the unofficial mayor of my neighbor. He knows everyone. He's always waving. His daughter asked him once if his arm gets tired by the end of the day. That one then I see Mike go up and out the street with a big room. A one man volunteer cleaning brigade. He's not the kind of guy who's still dark for more than this. But she's 80 something years old. So I understand she didn't little seen how. No. So my sister,  for dog. She had the shot spray paper. The shot she had. The license everything. I will not have my way I gave it to my neighbor Jeannie and told her to give it to her land in here And I gave it to Jeannie to give to her because if I were to give it to she probably didn't have to get And to this day she does not only I gave it to that dog I don't need to tell you this is the kind of story Mr. Rogers likes to hear my what a tender heart And that be somebody that you'd  to know is this somebody that ? I know well. Yeah, he loves the costume for me What a sign, yeah I'm made. Across the street for my apartment, there's a board of buildings that everyone says used to be a brothel. The next building overblown is the kid named Hopy and his blind grandfather Pete. About 15 or 20 folks stand there please. More than once I've seen the cops going. and drink someone out in handcuffs. Happy and Pete keep a kind of use car light going on the street, fun of their building. Cars at Mike fixes up. Fact about Mike Car from them, 73-4LTV. Every time I pull out Mike Wistels and Shakespeare's head says, it's a cruiser man, it's a cruiser. These days there's not as many old Cadillacs, Lincoln's parked on the black and night, more saddens and explorers, shiny VW jettis. Old buildings are being demolished. In their place, we strike. how the minimum sprout rate up. The condos are taking over all our neighborhood. Our neighborhood ain't even here no more, he's gone. The corner of the on-ray in Iowa just after dark. 3 teenagers were hanging out, sipping dooses. 22 hours bottles of beer. Gustavo, Isaac, and Ronaldo, who's nicknamed the mouth. And who's probably lived at 10 different apartments, or by creating it. Everywhere in this whole neighborhood, Marshville and Cortez. Lionel and Cortez, Hermitza and Cortez. and walk high. Chicago and wood, everywhere you name I lived all around here and I know more it can't afford the man. Papa's got to move up. That's still called back. I was be here. Regardless what, who moved in? I always be here. You can't make her wait for the hood or the hood or the hood for the game. I'm not a steam. That's game members going. These guys are pretty lucky. They saw weed and hang out drinking. , of course he... I had decided to talk to them because when I was roaming my neighborhood, I had to talk to my neighbors. The same thing kept coming up. A lot of people were afraid of their neighbors. Who exactly are your freedom on that? The alliance with the same way. Gangbangs. The kids in beggy jeans, best moderacies. Who's the neighborhood with their stereos bumping? The gangbangs, they said those are the bad news. Guess it's all surprised. The mouth has all the ideas about who the bad need. The neighbors are. They want to appear in this trust him. When the neighborhood, he didn't agree with what we did so much so he'd stand in his house with a video camera and we were doing it. Try to bring it to the beaten eating, . He's the follower of the camera, literally follow the surrounding neighborhood camera. what I'm going to call the cops and you, then. , for what? We ain't bothering you, ? That's what I think the worst neighborhood, ? Yeah. They come in here fearing us saying that, , maybe thinking that we're going to do this. We're talking,  what I'm saying? We know what we mean. No way, no one animals, but we're normal people  you. Someone  me and him who don't have everything we're trying to hide against. They're house, what do they do? They drink maybe some wine or something. And to us, the nids, this, we're standing on a pavement. This is our house. ? I've been here long, ? I'm older, I got older, I got older, be less. and say what is neighborhood then they're all then they're building a living. Back in Mr. Rodlin, he talked to his over. Whether it's music or a dog that's managed, or neighbors prefer each other. He comes clear that what he do in any of these situations is pretty much the same. I can tell you what I'm doing now. hope that I would hope that I would be brave enough to visit. It's so easy to get into. And if I would visit you and find out that you are a reasonable person, I could tell you about my sensitivity and see if it would make any difference to you. It's very elaborate. Pretty sure Alex Booper comes in with a question. He said, when you said if you were in Davies in your situation, you said that you hope you would have courage to go out and visit. And a lot of what you were finding when you were talking to people had to do with that same-serve notion. And I wonder what he said that we're afraid of, who? Perhaps we think that we won't find another human being inside that person. Perhaps we think that, other, there may be our people in this world who I can't ever communicate with. And so, I... I'll just give up before I try. And how sad it is to think that we would give up on any other creature who's just  us. After people around here wouldn't even if they were listening to this tape they wouldn't put the three faces there. behind the talking they wouldn't put together because they wouldn't sit there and think that we're instead of doing nothing. To sit there and think about  stuff  that that happens in everyday life . They look at us as  kids that are just probably doing bad . They don't need to do that because  we don't look at them and say oh they're rich snapp  we say . Person carrying their life doing what they're doing mind their business  just because I carry my life in a different way you don't have to . So talk you have a good time maybe we got stopping. common in the middle. A few weeks ago, in the middle of the night there was a huge fire in the building next door to hop in the peats. Nobody seemed to be heard. Everyone in the block came out of their buildings and stood on the sidewalks, watching the blaze and looking around in each other. Everyone in the t-shirts and bat-bobs and night-gouts, blinking their eyes, light from the fire of their faces. And then moment  that doesn't seem  it would beat at heart for everyone to just see each other as people. The way Mr. Rogers and the mouth called Pockbuff. But  how it goes. After an hour, the fireman rolled up their hoses, chucked stiff to the way, and everyone disappeared back to their own apartments. Maybe Rockbuff is a greater found magazine. His new book. pounds too, comes out this month. See you at the 30sit city tour, details at www.foundmagsene.com. Jettled people will never ever let you down. They read the good book, So try to Monday. Let's how the weekend goes. I've got to grow next to her. So you want to be a good person. You're going to be a good neighbor. But most of us have gotten into a situation at 1.00 or another when that was just not very easy. Cheryl Wagner. Then let them grow up. next door is driving me crazy. I think she wants something from me. Tucker says I'm just imagining it. She must be about 11 now, a medium brown black, maybe Spanish girl with hair tied back in a perfect bun. In the time that I've lived next door to her, she's grown about two feet and gotten her first real bike, a Walmart mountain bike. At first she only turns circles in her small, front yard and navigated the cracked sidewalks between her houses. But now she's gone biking for hours at a time. I tell you our name but I've blocked it. She knows mine, though I don't remember ever telling it to her. We both live in shotguns, so the alley between our houses is about five feet wide, maybe smaller. Sound ricochets up, amplified, and bouncing between our houses into my windows. I hate that. Since I started growing tomatoes, bananas, eggplants, whatever I can get to sprout in my backyard, the little... The girls been hanging around on the woods too outside her bedroom door overlooking my backyard. RL. That's your name. It just snuck up on me when I wasn't trying to think of it. I just turned 30 and I'm already losing my mind. Okay, so first RL  my dog Buster. Is that a hot dog? She asked a bathhouse, I'd say. Why is he so short? He was made  that so he could snick him. Bushes in the woods better when he's hunting foxes in another country. France made me. He hunts? No, well, yeah, but just chicken bones and beer and french fries and stuff when we go on walks. No foxes here. Is he a pit bull? Boyc husses would say when they came over. He mean? No. Ariela would boss. Sometimes I would hear her through my back screen door whispering busters name over and over to the chicken water fence I made. So, if. and the witness's gate and go eat stuck under people's houses. Ariel's cousins would come over and I think maybe they were slipping my dog candy and she was in bubble gum. Because I would find wrappers all around Ariel is little stoop by my fence. She invests her fell in love because he wags himself in half when she says his name. Wish I was  that. Here comes the bad part. This spring Ariel gets a plant and puts it out on her side's stoop by where I'm gardening and water . when I'm gardening and her plant does okay for a while, but she doesn't water it every day so it starts to brown and curled. So I begin watering his for her. One day I give her six miracle gross sticks to bearing near its roots because it looks so wilty I feel bad for her. Other than that I try not to get involved because I know how attached kids around here can get. Does that make me a bad person? I... Aren't you selling stuff? mother has his terrible boyfriend. He's tall, wide, imposing, pushy hair and beard. Old work truck brings profit, crafts and fish buy and burlats, stacks that sit and steep and sun in our alley. Drink similar tall boys until he's yelling on the front step, the work. Though in its defense, I should say that he does toss the tall boys and our recycling bin instead of on the ground or under the house. The boy friend and the mother, a wiring woman in her late 30s. from concerto days, sometimes Fridays, Thursdays, and Sundays, and screen, and yell, and proteins , while RL and Hyde to the bedroom near my backyard. Which brings me to, is it just fighting or more? I'm not opposed to calling the police when I hear what sounds  beating. No one has any visible bruises, but it sounds  chairs and couches against walls. RL is a whole world being ransacked. I hear the fighting in my living room and in my bedroom, even... with my in their music turned up. I hear fighting over my friend's band practicing next door. I hear fighting over their friends screaming drunk in 60 soul hits. The soundtrack to my life is that's domino. Sad old motown all wailed against the other side of my wall. Trying to submerge the neighborhood and creamy water songs. Calm things down. Last spring, Ariel is mother sat with her on our side's students and helped her with her homework. Ariel, I'll make straight-a-days. Some days I'd hear her mother calmly chiding her in a clean up her room. This summer rolled around quick and now the long-head boyfriends around all the time. What would I tell the police? I don't think Ariel should have to listen to all that you are not going to stand there and talk to me  a bitch and you fat language and you're kind of my daughter. One day I came home and there was a small manilla envelope in my mailbox. It said, cheer up, have a good day from our yellow, the little girl next door. I opened up the envelope and there was a smiling wooden clothes pin with gooly eyes glued to it and I panicked. I called my mom and asked her what I should do. She said, thank her. I said, I'm afraid she wants something. Don't scrutinize everything. My mom said. I didn't know what I wanted to give her in return. I couldn't just knock on her door and thank her face to face. I wound up picking some flowers I'd grown and leaving them with a note on her front step one morning before I left her work. I don't know if she ever got it. Recently I stopped seeing her on the side stoop so much. She got her bike and started riding. Her mother casually says to me one morning, sorry if I was beating on your door and ringing your doorbell screaming for help last night. My boyfriend had too much to drink and got a little crazy. I thought it was going to kill me. That's why the police were here. I told him that to come around anymore, but I don't know. Sometimes I want to take RAL of foreign ice cream, but then I think how impossible that is. In ice cream, I showed her a tiny wood Buddha once for a report she was doing for school and her mother was jealous. Black metal her grove in some out of town in a Mercedes SUV with this new wife and kids straight out of a Tommy Hellfigger ad last summer and picked Ariela up. While she was gone, the mother kept stopping me on the sidewalk in front of our houses. She said that Ariela was excited because on her way home she was going to get to ride in an airplane. She said that Ariela had been scared to leave because she thought something bad and was going to happen to her mother. I told her mother to call on the phone as she needed anything because my doorbelt doesn't work. She said thanks, but she didn't ask for my phone number. A couple of weeks ago, Tucker Hammer had some rotten railings off the RL aside of the house. Our slum lord was about to kick us out and sell the place. And all four of us were thinking about getting a low income loan and pitching in $200 each for the mortgage, so we wouldn't have to move to a dangerous neighborhood. We were trying to fix up the place for the government inspectors. One of the rotten railings had a message penciled on it in a child's brown hand writing. You were not good neighbors, railing said. You never say, hello. My male roommate, Lone to Little Boy down the street, must have liked pump. The boy never brought it back. And then one of his cousins got shot. So my friend didn't want to ask for his pump back, even though he didn't have the money for a new one. Maybe that's how I feel. Last night I cracked open the door because I heard slanting and cursing and someone yelling, he isn't going to be 911. I saw the mother's brother throw a 10-speed at her. I saw him shove her into the street. Arialla was standing on the front sidewalk near them the whole time, holding a portable phone with a finger pointing at the dial. Arialla's in charge of dialing 911. She looked up over her shoulder at me. I shut the door. I said, do not. called the police, home note was huge. I said I can't stand it, but it didn't call that night. Why didn't police always tell when they say they won't? The brother left in the shouting stop. I called the YWCA 24 hour crisis line. They said, because the woman won't help, we can't help people unless they want to be helped. What about if there's a kid who said, do you have a... reason to believe the child is being physically harmed in some way? Not physically, I said. Well, then no. The next day the mother stopped me and said, Arielle, I was worried about me worrying. I said I never know if I should call the police. She said, only call it for boyfriends trying to hurt. Not if her brother is trying to hurt. Just the boyfriend. Then call. She got to apologize. I want to get rid of my chicken wire and put up this big fence between our houses. I think about it whenever I go outside. Yesterday I went to the Green Project salvage place and picked out some metal grit. The week before I bought one of those cheap rolls of bamboo. The other afternoon Tucker helped me put it up, but none of it was tall enough. And this morning when I went outside, a breeze had knocked everything down. Share a Wagner version of her story originally appeared on the website, www.googleletters.net Coming up, we'll let the rats out. That's enough for me to be the words to a hit song. In a minute, I'll go to a great international, Wayne Art Program. It's a American life, America Prize. It's really going to program of course, which is something. variety of different kinds of stories on their phone. Today's program, neighbors, how even people who want to love their neighbors, one of their neighbors as themselves, end up confusion and trouble with their neighbors. We wrapped it at three of our show, act three, the Ratman comment. Hey, today this has this story of people wanting to do the right thing on Black where she grew up in Washington DC. Black where she still lives now? Mostly coming up my block. I think this cozy, claustrophobic thing. Two and three story row houses are squeezed together. There's the Nelson's house where I first got drunk and parked. Next to it is Erica's dad's house where I heard about Nixon's enemies. Food horse down is 1773, where Frank Sanchez's mother, shot his father in the bathroom. Who stayed up all night long. And then, in the middle of the block, right before you get to the fire house, the light opens up. A low-stuck-o-house dance of hot, set back her to the street. It's an old farmhouse really to cover my brain and surrounded by a saggy picket fence. Before this house blocked, but when there were just fields here, Bobby grew up a block over and says, it's the kind of house he and his friend went to and purchased some Halloween to scare ourselves. We stand on the sidewalk looking through the poachy and over the ambitious which come up to our shoulders. It's closed up, there's no sign. And the sign no one lives it, ? I love it. and there's sheets and windows, , just no lights hardly ever on in there. So it's just a spooky place. The house belongs to Mrs. G. She's 85 and has lived on my streets since the 1940s. Although she adds  she's still on the farm, she grew up on North Carolina. I see her scatter food scraps for the birds her yard is a chicken coop, but the bread. and fish had strong more rats than sparrows. It stinks so bad that the UPS man, Gansy, he won't go to the door anymore. We just leave some packages and  it. Neighbors wonder about it all the time. No, I've seen the backyard. I've seen the front, never seen anything inside of us. I only remember something I know about. I'm curious about that house. I believe it's all room room. I stood at the front door and I saw a beautiful painting inside 演. and there were cockroaches literally all in around the painting. And a stepson should be fixed in sub-the-interior. It was spelled, spelled, spelled, and it was gibret. This is Jean will sit on a cement bench in the middle of a pope week all day. She used to be there with her word. looking dog Morgan, he died a few years ago. She took a bad turn after, started looking raggedy wearing pants and shirts with big tears. I find myself looking away when I'm talking to her, because it feels wrong to get a glimpse of her pale creaks. Around the time that Morgan died, the rats really started taking off. Maran lives three doors down in 1770. I have seen these rats. I'll be talking to Mrs. J. J. and Mrs. San Juan. The rats will be in front of her door just hopping,  playing tag. In broad daylight, and they're very bold. And they're felt very well at home because she ignores them, chooses not to see them, or maybe she even feeds them, perhaps they're her pets. Rats on different Mrs. G's house. Out of the blue, Betty. of Europe. Judith, my neighbor, for lawyer, she called to say, Mrs. G. Petskans. Have you seen her, Judy? No, she said the baby house. When I asked baby, G. B. said, I didn't see her, so I'm going to ask. No matter, Mrs. G is now the lady who pets the rents. On the one side of Mrs. G, there's the fire house. On the other is baby and for man. In the picture. They lived next to her for 20 years and in the last four, it's become horrible. A few months ago, the family cat and dog got to a tinkerbell started to sit statues in the kitchen pant, just sit there staring at a big bag of pets. At first, BD and Fernanda thought their pets had suddenly become really smart, able to communicate they were hungry. When they moved the pet to a bell, they found a huge hole in the cage floor. but they said no to a Philip up.. through the mortar and electrical wire right into their kitchen. That same day Fernando went out and bought a bunch of wrap-ups. The first time that I got warned there was  here, , when he was a 6 inch beach rat, all of them . You caught one in the mirror? Right here on the table of the same thing. This is G, is lucky that our next turning inverse offer ended. baby. They are both community activists. They believe in compromise in working things out. Sit with them a while and they'll tell you that it hasn't been all bad in the most time, that she's great with their kids and their pets. She's part of this community. It's one of the best community members that we have. She walked the street all day. She's talked to people. She's very friendly to all that people are much. Say hi to everyone. She's not who is going in the bus. And everyone of us talked to her. We are now walking away from her. We don't even see her. It's true. Every month Mrs. G brings me a $20 bill for the neighborhood fund. It helps pay rent for an elderly carpenter who can't afford the rising rents on our street. That's much more than some of the high-powered lawyers on the block have ever given. For years, BD and Fernando have tried talking to Mrs. G about the rats. They talked to her over and over. They offered to help her clean up her yard. house, this is G. Always says, I'll take care of it, but nothing gets stopped. And the rats keep multiple. We really feel very much caught. This is an elderly person who clearly need help. , our way and who we are, they're not allowed to impose certain times things that would put her in a position that she would lose property or even her own freedom. This really drives BB craze. She can fix most anything. I go to her when I'm stuck on top of problems, tenants facing eviction, suicidal team or a kid who can't read. BB always knows what to do. She started to feel trapped in her own house. She couldn't sit on her porch or leave a windows open because of the stench of the rats and the cows. It's not our nature to use enforcement. But here this... the situation where , the very little we can do, you've done the talking, you've done the conversation, we've tried not to be the sort of annual neighbors, let me tell you, I hear some every neighborhood on block, and very often I hear so why don't you do something about it? So, three years ago, BD finally called the Department of House and the Department of Health for an inspection, nothing happened. be called again, knowing full well that if the system ever got triggered, serious things could happen to her name. For a long time, Mrs. G was blessed with the amazing incompetence of the disease government. The sluggish workers charged with enforcement with get-a-call, put it on their list, and now and then get around sending someone out. One day an inspector knocked on Mrs. G's door and was apparently she's the way by her, as for I think she was. worn by a pack of rounds. That's what people say in the way. Every time I ask Mrs. G if I could get her virgin of all of this in an interview, she said no. Sometimes nicely, and sometimes not. Seeing the government failing, due to it, the lawyer made a calculation that money might be paying to move Mrs. G. She dispatches a developer. to buy both her houses. With the DC housing boom, they're worth even in their terrible shit, at least $1. The developer called me to find out what I'm, and after a while, he laid his cards on the table. I just put my grandmother in a home with it, and I can help Mrs. G. G. I was beside this son. I couldn't imagine anyone but Mrs. G. House, rats and all. And what was his developer planning anyway to whitewash the house, maybe bulldozed it and you're looking at the build current stores? You see, that's how we must destroy it. It actively vicious spread rumors about this developer because I didn't  the way he said she deserves to live in a nice place. I got my neighbors' rower, I dangle the gentrification threat which worries old times. I even got Fernando Go, even though a developer could be his salvation in his key to pressure. I think that's that this anti-made approach that's really jeopardizing negative energy. because he said the ballad was coming with effect on every one of us and that's the problem because I as a neighbor, if I see that you bring it in 15 unit building next to my house I will screen and I will prefer to keep her. In the end it was Mrs. G who Stonewald the developer wouldn't talk to her even after we left the flowers. She is masterful, science teacher. It's hard. I want Mrs. G to change. I wanted to quit creating problems for my neighbors, and yet I admire her stubbornness and tenacity. what is she holding on to? The big pile of putrid garbage and wet newspapers paced at thick with captives. This is something both BD and Mary have thought about. Clearly from conversations with some others, something drastically changed when her husband died. And... Somehow, a part of her has stood still. She's talked about her husband, no. It was a real love story. They knew the sweethearts in high school, but then they married different people. And here's later. They reunited and made me. It sounded  they were very much... I've heard neighbors say they used to walk down the sidewalk and in him. My cloth is what you call them. My cloth who fixed anything. There was a time when the greenhouse had all its shutters up. Every picket in place. I don't think Mrs. G counted on the DC government ever reform. But two years ago. People elected a new mayor here and he said about coordinating city services. They started keeping a record of complaints and cross-referencing, getting the Department of Health to talk to the Department of Housing, and then just when all that was in place last summer, BD took advantage of a winless date to sit outside on our porch to discuss a project for the college, and well, the rats started doing their thing. When BD's college got back to her office, which happened to be office of the mayor, she made a few phone calls. The same day, Jose Swayda, the new neighborhood services coordinator, got in a sign. Fixed the problem in 1767. That's it, Sway. Hey, baby, it's Jose. You're happy this is about the mountain in more hammocked  that. Let me tell you, this is a degrees of scoring as Elfazza, a manning. It's funny how we're all connecting. I've known Jose since I was a teenager, dance partners. He knows BV2, their sons play together. So you can see what Jose might take the rat's purse. probably the most important thing to know is this, Jose has only had this job as a neighbor who fixed her point here in Montenegro. He likes it. He has his own cell phone, a government car, and a really good sound. No way is he going through this job. He has to fix the problem and misogynicism. The situation is 17, 16, 7, and 3, to what they call critical there. Even the fire people that store are now planning about the Montenegro. He's not a rat. He's not in that house. And she's a... I don't think that  how we're going to approach this, but it's not going to be as tightly and care as for this really. So Jose went out to talk with Mrs. G. I'm going to cut down going. Pressure in her, pressure in need of pressure her. So I pressure G. and passed her up the street to talk to her because Mrs. G will listen to a preacher over English. I think it was the preacher who convinced her to let Jose clean up his arms. We were all impressed. Mrs. G. never lets anyone out. She actually said, okay, come on Friday and we did. Three fire marshals, Gerard the Ratman, Jose, two neighbors and myself. We would  to say help you out with the fact that I'm not going to be in the hospital. We are not our sisters and I'm not going to be in the hospital. When we get there, Mrs. G has beat us to it. The Pope we, her beloved Pope we, is cut down to the ground. The Bush's trim all with her kitchen scissors. This is G stands. are different, nor fully visible for the first time in six months. She lets me record this day, maybe because she thinks it will shield her from the city officials. Well, I just didn't do what I do in the morning, and I didn't. I would pray that I could do it when I say heaven . Mrs. G is hoping she's done enough to make this go away. But everyone keeps offering to do. Yeah, I'm asking for a day. This is G as a laughing, but I can tell her deeper question. She never sounds as high pitched. She's really soft. Robbed of their mission the city workers poke around for something they can do. Can we rape? No. Can we put a smoke detector inside their house? No, no, thank you. Jose is trying not to notice that his party is a bust that he got us all here for not. He leans over to inspect a drink from the city. He's a couple of lily. Okay. I still don't get it. I don't know. Because I mean, well you're used to people won't. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, we'll see in the me as much. I  to get some guide to help you trim the rest of it, just clean the rest of it down, but you don't want to do that anymore. Out on the sidewalk, I called Jorar the side. He's a city rat excerms, and he is gentle almost porting with the sysjik. He'd love to kill the rats in Rihar, in her house. He'd be a legend in Ratwell, if she would just let her. At the funeral, the funeral was the ائth over, with us, and you're going to know her. her and if the more she left, people will know you're more you're more. And what would be more that she does in my Roaches and Rags? You already know that. I keep thinking about what Mrs. G's said to Jose. You're used to people wanting to know. It's true we all are. We figure if something... Someone's alone, struggling with things, and all they need is their neighbor's help. And if the neighbor offers help well problem solved. It bugs us when people see now. It bugs me anyway. I want to say to her, Mrs. G, you help call every month with this run. Why won't you let us help you? 3 weeks ago, I went down the beating for Nando's house. They're all dreading what's going to happen to Sama. He's been 8 months. the city came out and the weeds and rats are out of control. Fidi says the cleanup was purely cosmic that no one ever makes a real dent in the box. One of the prey outs is that at one point they could take to the right to solve the human that house. And the house is too warm that at one point the rats would eat one electric boy. And that would cause you to make your body and she will die in. and everyone will build people a couple weeks and live with grown-up. We should call and get the house to build for themselves. Baby looks at our husband and answers. Okay, do it. Mix the call. There's a pause. And then he mutters. I feel too cute. This is G Ghost to the grocery store and we can. I look out my window and see her coming back from the safe. dragging heart both cat-loop for the strings. On Sundays though Mrs. G. Cones are widely here to the side, puts on a skirt, blue one usually, and walks up to the Baptist Church on 16th Street. After the service, Sarah, the Secretary of the Church, comes and visits a while. They sit outside on the bench and talk, never inside. Not even Sarah goes and saw. If it's cold, they just zip your concert. Next door, Fernando has come up with the new approach to his neighbor problems. Talking failed, government failed, and real estate. He just installed an anti-wrapped box, an electronic box that sends out a signal painful to a ratty. From Mrs. G's yard with hopefully coming back, you can bear us.
