Since he began English, they were wanting to. They didn't go to school, they were wanting to. Instead, he and the other illegal immigrants working in these restaurants, within tiny apartments, sometimes in the back of the restaurants, seeking on bunk beds, working 12 hours a day, six days a week. Though, wanting that, I can tell is that we haven't been  little time-tap, no. You did a little contact with Dr. Moon. The thing that must have been so strange though is that you're working in a restaurant, so you see all these people coming, you would see families with kids, people your own age. And it must have just seemed  they were on the other side of some sort of wall wall that you could never find out. Yeah, it was kind of, I thought it was a different wall. There were people doing the Seas in terms of the wall behind me. Yeah, see, sometimes you don't know how to say it. I think I came here and then you tried to say, oh why? I keep on the reason. We talked about this a while. And finally, I told the, that it seemed  he was living in a kind of limbo. Not as old as China. Not a real American, right? And he agreed. Bimbo, yeah. Right between, someone between. Yeah. You didn't know where it was in the station. No, no, no, no. The idea of limbo comes somewhere. If. comes from the church and originally it was used to describe people who aren't going to have them but they aren't bad enough for hell yeah yeah I know yeah I know which country is the heaven and which country is the hell well I don't know I don't know you're okay this is a TV show  in China China's great it's called picking people in you making people in New York yeah another city picking what being busy Yeah, Beijing, why okay? The title that can be shown on any time, can you show a comment? Every time when episode comes out, there's a quote. So you'd be  the person, send a person to Europe because it is hell, really? If you hit a person away, I also send a person to Europe because it is hell. Ha ha ha ha ha. That eight times you see that episode, you see this quote. I was going to be , I thought, come. We as America can be heaven, it can be hell, but today on our program, American Limbo, stories people who somehow have ended up living completely outside the grid, normal American life. We have three stories for you in three acts, act one, the family that flees together, trees together, and now that does not make a lot of sense right now, but we need it, it will. It will. Act two, what's French for a straight three, American parent abroad tries to make this kid more. American using the powerful force that is American baseball and how is it that any kid who is that? That three Julie Andrews world Sylvia just lives in it in which one girl takes a tape recorder to college and documents her first year in just 11 minutes WB's is Chicago and Public Radio International. It's American Life. I'm our glass. Stay with us HEC ON HEC ON This is the story of a family that drops that entire way from society. Goes on the run after they get in trouble with the law. Two parents, six kids, no money making do as they can for seven years. And how do the kids turn out after all that? Actually surprisingly, kind of great. Families called the services. The American life producer Alice Bunder visited them in Florida. Visit the people who see the life of the drugs. Kids gather around the shallow world. Maybe 350. and the alligator's pept inside. The first thing? First, get a point. Push it. Don't just get your hand out and pull it out. No, don't do that. You just keep whipping so fast that the hand is not too fast. That's Anna, 14, the youngest girl. And rising her brother's side, 21, to stick his hand in the alligator's mouth. Sigh, has a different idea. I'm completely ingenious one. At any moment, this all day I kind of make shit to use anything. I'm gonna take this. the snare that I got and I put it over his mouth and I'm gonna full of tight so he can't bite. You just made it real quick with the data some string and some sticks. Some one there, the data just relax, just relax. For seven years, I'm driving with it in the morning and a tree house in Cyprus, and the riding pole of a boat, anywhere they can hide. But before that, for over 20 years, they lived in a house with local cells, apartment one. in the middle of my forest, the West Virginia. The group must have their own food in the garden, natural gas well in the property power there appliances. I had no electric bill. No heating bill. This is the mom to be charged. We just wanted to make our own little world really and have our hand long. I feel  my kids, they grew up and never never landed. They were , are they, well they had 148 c. plus. around and play in and they used every bit of it to add a tree house or a fort in every tree. I lean her husband along with 60's back to the land dropouts, and actually stayed dropped out. Her home in 1990's with the lollipop and 1970's, vegetarian bears, bear fruit children, lots of wood combs, even the crops they grew with us, which in 1992 became a home-to-lifed problem. When I had a cup, I started the mirror, I wanted to patch. I was going on the problem. My son, Ace, I was going to cut the grass. He had the lawnmower on and I had dinner cooking. And Ace, she came running in the house and he said, , dad said they're getting the van. , so we just left. Let's stove on. British cooker on. Dinner in the coffee, I had just made a pot of coffee and poured it up and we took nothing with us but the kids didn't have shoes on the feet and we just walked out of the house and that was it. Do you ask why I'm driving this up now? I'm not attached today. This is a planted earlier in the year. Rainiff's wife is diagnosed with surveillance, sal on paper and treatments. This is a small part of regular one. It's all right. It's on this kid. I still don't see myself as a criminal, but might decision to grow that part because my family and to separate that trauma. I just wanted to see that I feel really responsible for it. It wasn't a good decision. The differences in the growth and it was hard. You couldn't stay with anyone there knew that I'm criminal. You can drive their name. You can rent an apartment, you can a job, a rationality. And they couldn't show it to you, but I thought you were going to get a back-country. They had six kids. They youngest seven of them. They had seven dollars. I got a record. I mean, since she and I, I was trying to keep right there. I'm going to be arrested on you. They were going to let me take my kids to cheap one. No, I'm just new. It wasn't going to be good. It wasn't going to be good. It was going to be good. all of a sudden I think all my kids are gonna be scattered out in the foster homes. I'm not Everything's blown through my head. they weren't gonna Just possibly good The driver's is caught some lucky breaks Family friends happened to be passing three by that happened to drive you away Took them to Maryland. We're all a crash friends one from that in pretty months the weblines. Ron and his friend get up before dawn, grabbed the forest, and went with by son up who would back at the house, happened back in the yard, cutting and bending and defencious tables and chairs. The kids all helped, same-ish, weed and seat problems, did main and for plastic cups. Once they got a big enough furniture pile, they took a boat, so they ran backwards and sell it, but son quit. I would have  a reoccurring dream and I know that some of my kids would do. Of ... just walking through that house and looking at everything but you're not there to stay you're just walking through the house and I would just see it all the playroom where the kids play all their toys they've had through all the years or the walks of this left in I mean I can just see everything and the one thing that I would always be focusing on my dreams of the grabbing that Swiss army knife off Well, I've gone to the kitchen for the least low, so I have a nice little smile. I'm very serious. I'm very serious. I didn't realize I wouldn't have to let me that left. This is the oldest girl, 19-year-old mom. Kind of should be doing it and be able to go back in the few days. That's why I figured I'll think, and , where are we going to stay for a few days until we get back? The boat that would eventually be their home, was at that point at a dock in the Napolis at the boat. The club was planning to sign it up so it was scrapped. But when Ron asked about it, they said they'd sign it in the stead of $5,000. It was full of holes. Half right about it. Extranging it cramped at it before the lapidate boat was very close. It might not seem to be such a great thing. But the day that driver's testimony was going to happen as the long time. The patched holes were turned by when stood over stuff. on the hall and had a friend to tell them to what would be come home for next two years. Down the bay, from Marina, called Backyard Birds. Manager, James Brown. Right there, what looks  a big slip from here? That's where they pulled in when they first came in. One of the guys who are came in the office, he said, James did it to both here once to be held, but I think you better look at it. So I walked, that's it, okay. So I came out and I really walked down too. just  that where we are now. So what? 50 feet in the dark. And I just took one look at that and said, where what , my heart, where the sight that is. Just leaking the head of the head, comes going on it. I don't know if I will find comes running full time. Keep it's loading. The family looked time. And I thought, oh, mother, all those children on that boat. Thank God, it's not me. It was just, , just touched me right away seeing them. I can't see how it wouldn't touch anybody if they could see them that way. It's how it. This was not family, that it's best. The Germans is not the typical back-ared boats customer. The one thing, most customers didn't bring their boat in for repairs with their entire 8% payment. What's that? the horse to my home after the boat was hauled out of the water, placed on Jackson and Harlow. They didn't do what the Jarvison took, which was climb aboard the Spendon on its jacks, and proceeds to live on it, while they began. It was cramped in there. The three girls slept in the room in the size of two refrigerators, two lotus feet, even if you were 12-year old girl. The planking was on the process of being placed, so there were holes in the hall which they covered in plastic tarps. They made them a shallower under the boat, the make shit plywood walls. For two years they lived without the slightest bit of privacy from children. They couldn't make a move without everyone else in the film long ago. But none of this bother 19-year-old Mollon and her 17-year-old sister really explained what did. There's people. There's lots of people. Which wasn't normal thing unless you didn't. , because we be back in the woods. I was saying we're just  right in the middle of town. Everything is different about everything. It's seen every people every day. I was not normal. , we had  regular friends and it's the first time we could, , walk down the street to the front house. It was  we had company every day. What was it  going over to did their pants at her asking? Oh, so what do your parents do? I don't know. people ask you, , why did your parents, , sell their farm and less Virginia now? So live on that. I'm already open. Oh, I don't know. They just , oh yeah. And I was just kind of talking about it. I just be vague. That was hard, but that just can't be casual compensation. I was just always afraid of getting someone else to talk to the best of my knowledge. what I'm doing? I'm going to go back to my knowledge. , I know when you're anything. I'm going to go back. Yes, of their pets. Yes, that's your boat. In fact, I mean, let's say, after it was a long time, it became very normal. We just didn't think anything other than the fact, maybe they were sort of  the peace and enjoyed living in their boat and under the primitive conditions. The deaths were they chose to do. Even forgot about the fact that they were made of men's story behind us. And just kind of accepted the deaths the way they wanted to do. And as people dance, you say, oh, for you this fine, it just  you make  that. But, for time, the drivers displayed a larger and larger role in the community. I mean, got a job helping the ginger manage the office at the morning. The oldest boy, Nancy, started working as a ricker. This brother's asa inside, were hardly sought after to raise in the police boats. The girls were still home school, but they babysat, got jobs detailing the rooms, running through the back. The Germans' have taken classic fugitive trajectory. In reverse, they hadn't put civilization for isolation. They'd been clashed out of isolation and they could home get a wet by blending back into this cleansing system. What was it  to become a professor? It sort of worked. Oh, I'm out of the kit. Oh, I mean, it was , I mean, it really went  this. Yeah. I don't think so. It was different. It all  they go after their house. They went after TV and they went after their house. They were , that was different. Yeah. I don't think so. And it was just what we did. So, thanks a lot. And then, how's it? We've got some kid live on boats. Some kid live in tree houses. That's cool. The other thing that's amazing is that you were doing this at the age when I was third. Well, that was the worst. That was when I was most successful. Here, pressure. And when I felt most  an outpost. And when I felt  that. And I felt  that. . I felt  I was different. Everybody in the room. And here you were actually different. Everybody. But you didn't feel that way. No. None of us were mean here. So nobody's ever mean to us. No. No. No. I wouldn't. We were different. I'm not. We knew we were different. We didn't. We were. We were different. I should mention here another fact about the promises. There are only all the supply to the youngest row. Here. The girls have self-evil and blonde hair, boys are canned, actually bone and muslim. If there were a movie version of their story, it might be the only film industry where the Hollywood actors are actually less good looking than the film director. Combined this with the fact that they're all incredibly talented, they're unfailingly polite to each of them. It seems to have no familiarity with paddles and angst, and that for years they emerge this way each morning, reading and blowing, from within the hall of a hospital vote on jets a hit add a pihmatt's w34 That's the bb sometimes. Can you call me element if you don't make pipes to work hats expose you for work and get everything that you want. The most popular film-making films fan 빨icts and one of their films is and see what people are in the house. Who's ginger-grilled? It's just for an inspiration. You just say, what an ideal family wouldn't, wouldn't it be unique to have a family that involved with each other and concern? I mean, the children were making the little girls, were making baskets and painting pictures, and it was also good. And the mother would take time to acknowledge what they were doing and to advise them, or praise them, or whatever, and all in such a positive way that the girls would just skip. better here and inspired to do even more. , it's just a run. After two years in backyard boats, the sharp spike of adrenaline that every Jarvis felt in the sight of a flashing blue light and softened into a dull tap. The boat was beautiful, all hand-carp words, and two months away from being seen. The Jarvis is themselves, which he months away from just appearing on the scene. And then they got it. all the monsters. The FBI threatened to put her to him. She didn't tell. They were on the way. Once again, the job was as crappy as the guy who left. I just figured we always knew that. Again, the oldest daughter-in-law. I mean, I thought we were always gonna almost get hot. Just  we always did. And then I always did what. I sort of think that I didn't think that I'm gonna get hot. I didn't know what to do. We have been here. I haven't been here. Probably 97. What are we looking at? We're looking at our tree house. Our other homes we home. Just standing in the middle of a cypress swamp on the Solani River in western Florida with five to eight charges. They brought me here to show me when the last person's been turned out  a rock. The tree house is about 10 feet off the ground, suspended in the bees and two loads of trains. Ron built it at a swamp site for himself using a hand saw. He took him one month. We go up his staircase, built the vundentage site for his parents' last together. Inside, the gribles anything you see in the room is out. We used to live in here, and we had a chair here, and we had a set here, another chair here somewhere. This held all our fruits and veggies, this is how we're logged, and over. Here we had a fire voice and the town was at the top. We brought that up here and Ron made this far for us and we could either round it. The driver says only living tree house for two months before our nosey geek were some dinner of the morning. From there they went back and forth and wrapped the floor. They were living on that boat in the morning and seeing Augustine. The marshals found the cotton. I mean it says the dead. It felt the months that they should move on, but that life had gotten comfortable. The boys were on-boats. I hope they were getting a good job. The family helped together. When agents finally did show up, it wasn't surprisingly. I mean what to jail for three months, Ron for a little of a kiddo's. It's surprisingly beautiful in this one. The river is wide, and his parents lie in messing all along. The real squam and splash in the water. I mean tells me that there years in the run affected each of her children differently. And what's a good start? Washington girls don't compare dinner. I talked to her young boy, sigh, just 21. He's outlooked, they first quite a bit from his sisters and lovers. About what he's learned, his entertainment first read West Virginia. We really didn't know how people were. People are basically beast. Because most people aren't very friendly. Of course, we were lucky. They're shady side a lot of them. People were basically friendly people. They were primitive thinkers, but they were real friendly. They were nice people. Most of them were just out the hill, they were out the hill. They were out the hill. They were out the hill. They were out the hill. We didn't have no money. We had basically had no walls around us, because they were also rot. People were all the time, combined offers, heaters, blankets, all kinds of stuff. So it was nice up here. All the people around, they were great. I say, they were basically , they were really nice. They were really nice. What do you mean by that? to thinkers? I mean, , , well, I mean, by that it's, they don't mind. They don't mind. Yeah, eat meat. Smoking cigarettes, , mind,  running over that animal, that crosses the road. They don't mind just shooting something. They don't mind killing something. They don't mind driving their diesel boats. I'll live the place to film motorbike water. The words they say are pretty much the hell. The stuff that discuss don't need to be discussed around. is family. Don't forget, it's got to be a spirit. That's why I mean, , kind of, the thinkers just not really understanding what right is, what wrong is they don't know the difference. This is a primitive thinker. Is that your term or is that your term or is that your term or is that something that's  a, that's what I've learned. The rest of your family doesn't seem to, doesn't seem to feel as weird, but that don't seem to feel as weird because, because I don't have it. they they watch a little bit more TV than me and they listen more radio. I'm not attacking them want to say it but yeah they're different thinkers. It's not I made this stuff up I just feel on the level of right and wrong. I should come by your interest. I did come by it. It's right it's wrong. It's not two different rise. It's not two different ones. But I mean how did you how did you figure it out? I mean, how do you explain the fact that the other people don't know it? Well, what I see is being wrong. This is what this happens to my dad. That's what I see is being wrong. what I think coming to your house with guns? And point the guns I should take with you, it's the do whatever they want. what I think coming to your house and they can stop there. There's cigarette butts out on your carpet and they can pull all your clothes out. up to the floor and then go to your canvas and don't flower on the floor and you're opening on everything on the floor, , just to make a mess, not  you're hiding something in the oatmeal. And why do they need to do that? And then kick down your doors and break out your windows and they can walk through your house and they can put anything they want in their pockets. And for what reason? Because he grew some marijuana and smoke marijuana. Did he force anybody else's smoke this marijuana? No, he did. Let it, , position. anybody over this marijuana, , he was teaching us kids how to build furniture and how to be real mad and he had time to do all that because he smoked marijuana and he had time to sit and think about what he had to do and so what happened to him was wrong that's what happened to him wrong thing what he was doing is right Most of the family wouldn't put it the way side us, but they all find some version of the separation of the fields from the world of Clark. Molly and Lily say they feel older than that family. I mean says she sometimes feels she's on the outside with me. Straight up, this is what they do have. A fierce, unyielding, unbreakable to both from teacher. I think I've got some time to move. I don't break any thoughts. I'm not going to make you . When I visit, drivers are living on the boat, the first button element, the one that they don't themselves. They all gather in the alley, most things that they eat. A lot of times sign in, so if I could press, A's a place to go, and family sings. They're thing are, and the softened thing will happen to themselves right now. together. From the boat, you can see the shoreline from the north. Out swimmer. Coming up to people try to nudge themselves out of limbo and closer to everyday American life. Guess just how many of them succeed. Just guess. In a minute, a public video international win our program. So Ah chemielie阿 ka This American life America class. He's going to a program of course, which is something where you have a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, American Limbo, stories of people who have accidentally ended up outside the grid of normal American life. We were able to have the two of our program, that two. What's French for a Strow  3? This is the story of an American in Paris who chose to live in Paris, but decided at some point that he wanted to manage his head for the little more Americanness. But when one does this kind of thing, it's on instinct and it's gas and you cannot tell how it will come out. Here is that dad's kind of story, that I've got. I don't really remember how we first thought of the book. I think it made it right after I saw my son Luke, with just turned free, playing with the soccer ball and relaxing bird gardens. It wasn't just the kicknets, but the kind of non-shallot, the end of the body, who were a peon, and he rose to me called the set. Next to you, who wearing his turd shorts, bouncing ball. and put to foot, put it to skills. He had been born in New York, but he had no memory. Paris is no need home for those. When had we cashed? He said, he looked at me. That night, that time, said, hey, tell you about the work. Zerakra, some was to tell the South from this promise. But here's small noises, high heels from the eighth. And no, this is a pleasant time to find that. is not me as a time for small work for sleep. I have been drawn to Storytelling for a while and made increasingly frantic at this time to get a network program back home in the social schedule. Story about a little boy turned into a golden vision that has hadn't gone in. The re-naked the heart of the no-box of the song. This story, a little death. The one word I said, say Smallboard in anywhere USA, in the spring of 1908. Outwalking with his mom one day, he discovered that he had an uncanny gift for throwing stones at his. Pick one up through it so hard that it knocked a robin off his perch in a mile away, man and his mom tried it. Through an up, just as far, so softly it snuggled into the nest beside the brim. Now, for a few minutes. His parents, a little sadly, with the sense of obligation, immediately said him off on 2-3. to New York, try out New York Times, great amateur, Charney J. McCall. All these are Britain's suitcase, smothered back, filled with things, including spot, she thought might be useful in case the emergency. Got out of granted, so we can have all the way up to the public house, his mother told text and asked to see Charney. So, girl, is to Kato and Vish, is a first-capable. But he finally agreed to watch Bob Kid through. She was so polite, lettered from his parents' so insistent, because well, you never know. Called Big Six, great Christina's, out of the dugout to watch. Chief Mimes, great American Indian fashion, to get by, right? Chief came out, the weary, crippled, long-suffering day, this one. Thank you. quickspect, but the real cheap is still at this point. Not even China. Little guy walks to the mail, how do this cat? Not a baseball bat, cat is knickers. And that's fun. Everybody was impressed, put it down. Hey Mr. McGraw, I'm cheap. I ain't never seen speed  that. Any got movement on too? Well, that's it, man. Here, time to take your own mail. Think about it, it's more or less guy. that I wouldn't even know how to spasse for Tony. My idea is incredible 908 ball player dialogue we have on spasse for a moment. Mugra shot is triads were one and baseball was enough. But in the end he decided to give the kid a start at that time. Big benefit exhibition, try it with a polar ground. It's the Detroit Times. I stopped. Outside we have the steady stop in stone. Let me pass it to the transition. playing generates horsepower of emergency training and agression where I do not teach. rookie took the mount, wrote a song. Fans looked as though it might be a first perfect perfect 27 men up, 27 days, tell him the 6, rookie had to face terrible time. I realized that in the problem, since cops should have been bad at people from the start, I explained that even late soon enough, assisted on stored extra payment from Tigers' manager, playing charity exhibition, even though everybody else was playing free. The crowdfight is competition. The competition came to the plate, sneering. We baby, we call them Tarnquery. Let's see me  you're nothing but a baby. Loops, whole bot, still. There was a worse insult at her. Jackie Watts, first deal with broken dodges, never been called name of soul life. Shake, rookie lost a girl who's here. Still blazing though. Cup, just gotta be... You're working, you're doing your own assignments. You're looking Stanford over to come in. How can you, hard as you could, slight sharpened to research tips, stamped out on the roof, three-year-old book. Say, thinking rotten way to get on base, but say, all the same. Shaking off a couple of tears, looking at that to the mouth. Hey, you reckon you're a cry-day? Hey, everybody, look at the cry-day-day. Let's see. He liked nothing but a cry day. He came to taught him George Charles. And the rookie reached out and jumped. He was in the top of the night. Giant said, first over one round, he made a few mistakes. Walked a couple of times. He was three. And left himself with the basis loaded. George came to do everything. Out's gone crazy. Out's gone crazy. Out's gone crazy. Out's gone crazy. He made me, he cried some more, cried me. The rookie knew what he had to do. In the dugout, he had taken Zoldbott and the soup of his mother's pack, and went off to the church on the child's chest in case. The stoded unto his cat. Now, stripped a couple of drops of new, not the seams of the baseball, but rookie soon didn't know Tories, but bought them all. He was before they got involved in hisborn substance on ball-wise. he was playing fair. Hey, you guys going to go to sleep? Thanks for this voice, . So, call that. Right to the track, you go to the session and tune into the windows. Right to the evening, you're all. The vocal stretched through through all of all dipped and twisted and dipped, twisted again, curving all the way out through baseline and then, who's in halfway towards first? Finally, slipping it, softly and cleanly, right across the bed, straight beneath. Tie up, tie, grip, cut, add all day. Pitch ahead of the so-goal, it didn't just whip. The twisting itself did not fly out here, no knots. So body flew around  a wet flashlight, hands in and back as well. With chagal teeth in that. Sterego 3! Right, the upper. And the beaches of the polar bear to go. The rookie trucker. Who's the baby now, Mr. Car? He asked quite didn't he? On this way back to the duck. A kid sat on the shot of dead,  in a panicked dog, so he had to spring him to right to his waist. Christy Matus didn't say anything. That wasn't his way. The he went over his rookie came into the duck. Took off the rookies' hat, crossed up his hair. Outside, proud wouldn't he? Our last super rookie Brokey! How do I only sound from the show? It's short, constant. I had named Ken knowledge of a kind of silent excite. Certainly, I had witnessed it once in my senoprene night theater, though I certainly never created it before myself. What we had here was a hit. Terrible tie-cop, called him a baby, he had thrown the bottle ball, and then boosted. That night, the rookie was offered a contract. in the team got on the overnight sleep in the sit-ups, adding how to steam the sports in this park. Chief tucked the rocket whispered, or went on to the team on the quick guys' last run. You okay, Rocky? I'm okay, Chief. Rocky said, many of the sense of the train tracks that I think was so blowing, and the other ball players in the next car, laughing on playing cards, 4-5-deep asleep, somewhere outside the commons. I'm okay, Chief. The group did. And many did something he had never done before, where they stopped minds. Without appreciation or hesitation, without tears or arguments or requests to come straight into the big bed. The world right old. Shows. The world is not a good thing. The world is not a good thing. The world is not a good thing. The world is not a good thing. After a couple of months, I found him on the street. What picture did someone want to play? at midnight. He heard the words, pull up rooms, full count, all the way to the backstop. Not exactly sure. No picture at all. He had never been to a baseball team. Never seen a map word club. Never been inside a ballpark or even watched a ballgame on television. No one looked new played baseball. No were talked about. The words in situations were pure abstract or the clichés I rolled out. You have. all day, steamy sportsman's part, no foreign substances on the old pill. What do you think? What did you see when he heard of him? I knew that he wanted to hear the words as much as I needed to say. He zipped you to search it better. What did the words mean? I had spent my adult life believing in storytelling and some credibility of the details. Now, fine, I made up story, someone  me. The details had no credibility at all. No existence, septus. sound. You are supposed to use a word I know as you can talk to point your thing. I hope the thing will somehow end up point yet something bigger. Fear is state of mind. But now I said, pull around, so I will call it. And the words call it in my son a powerful reaction. But what are that second range where the words were supposed to become things even just images in his head? There is, I think, a force in stories, words in motion, that I did draw some forward pastings. Directing. The feelings, where it does, and the trouble is you don't know which way to go until you've already teach music. Sometimes the words fly right over the fence, all the way out. Make them do it one time out of pre-implied it, and you've got a reputation as someone playing. Dad, until we decint their time story. Do it three times out of five in public, in your mark with why, for decades. After about a year, telling the story. I went to New York to give it a talk and I turned the trip from literary mission, sort of rookie collectors. I wanted to bring home tangible evidence of something that is a matter of fact, never taken place then. I bought a baseball inside the feed, box of books and car bear, all at a 10 burns video on the base. I vintage giant's cap child size, which I thought would be the hardest thing to find, turned out to be, absurdly. Past so neat package now, but I just walked into a memory of it. the store in the next 11 found the replica cap on the prop. When I got home to Paris, I put on the video from the PBS SpaceBoss, which I've never seen. And we watch all those trickery, or friend, where it goes through this. There was Ty Cobb, looking at the coconut evil. There was John James Crawl. There were pitching and batting. I realized him looks comfortable, happened the wrong way around. There was bass rind. There was Christie Max, and then a picture of Maddie. Shoot Maddie. and some Mishor to Z. Stolen dissolving into a picture of a small, serious boy with long face, wearing a small cap perfectly sobered special. Going into a pitching one. I still have no idea what we actually must. It's not Christy Maxis. I found a picture of him in his doctor's ear. But of course, Luke never was. Perfect. There he is. We wine. Watch Maddie in the book here. It was on characteristic of the silent arresting after news, before dinner I heard him talking to his mother. He had his hands up  this, saying chat. I don't know what. That was enough excited, enough reality for one day I had gone. And it wasn't until a week later, I tried out an insurance machine. Honestly got insurance cheap. looking just to see how to run. Hey look, that's the chief. I announced it proudly, opening your baseball inside the pitiates pensar. He paused, looked at the picture, looked back, peering in for a moment, and then he got a funny guilty smile on the face I never seen. Oh, set during the time of the picture. Thought it was his mother? What do you mean? I mean, I knew it was, but I thought it was. I mean, I knew it was a man, but I thought he was the mother. Okay, stump. All it was his mother. He actually blushed, I said it was something, once so deep, so important going on, what he was trying to tell. He feared some other level, it seemed silly. And his mind's here, he could hear a Thai call, E.B. But remember I said, his mother packed a suitcase, he had the mom's suitcase. And I knew it said, I stopped him. I can't, I just thought, how does Hanukkah was had? I tried to smile. I thought it was a girl. It was a mother. I got it then. He knew that the word, the cheat, stood for some kind of old man, the weather that was summoned up this kind of old man. He ordered grizzled coordination American Indian casual music brand, I'm not sure. But the small place that he occupied was so deeply maternal that it was, well, he was his mother. But it'd be low in him to sleep, night after night, but it's not the all purpose fit. These words point directly to the symbol, it was the obvious one, but it wasn't my son. Troubled with mental catch, said, well, you've got to change a similar thing. Serring down his polar grounds, what he'd see is what he needed. And that was the same face of solidly. Mama had been there, he's dead side all along. Bye. to slow a reader in my own fiction to slow. The rookie story goes on, but over time, Luke's search, it became more and more detached from basement. The rookie answer to Godly face is the little boy began to give his scary voice. The real witch, I tied cob dressed up  a witch, I achieved rest of  a witch, over time, cyberおい soupic. the one small acting that can be ordered. The rookie has come to fight a quick dictionary of the animal languages. Sex bomb. To decide, first car rate will. Compressed early rocket ship vehicle. Map of Paris, the window to the park. Time machine. A map of secret route to the South Pole. And rain your nets. Since it's time. Story belongs to Luke. I don't think about the rookie as much as I've used to. When the bombs began to fall in Serbia, again. after other serving concentration in 1914 and everything but I realized the stone that by making the world three years old in a nation away was leading and protecting to the centuries horrors. Then I did quit population and realized that you would have been talking down the first one just to all of a sudden. The lucky was luck. When I tried my little cash and you want me to upgrade the market and enjoy the world's really great pieces that somehow that's really amazing. Anyone who would offer themselves convinced them would remain beautiful with a few kinds of free meals done. Plus something cool. Yes... Some sort of tiredness ahead of me, basically enjoying this moment right now... to the right, gave up after the development. Who are present around that time? He asked us to make him his own top-dead entity. Martin and Metchiated Journalist. Press passed from Dublin when I have. So that he could pretend to cut through it. He made him the pressable looking fake French Dublin doctor. The black white photo amounts gripped in visual cooking stamps. At bedtime now, for the rookie story starts, he likes to act out French bureaucrat Tom. I play a function, writing it and something. Scals that can be totally precious as a cult. Then I let him pass any heart-jettings. Arm is here. He did not recognize. Rimm is his troves. While his mother acts up low and I reclusted. Human and mom, privileged functioner. So he has his mother. I suppose it's about time to come home. And I'm got next story. The rookie can be found in his book, Paris to the Moon. right up to the New Yorker magazine. Actoring. It's Julie Andrews World, Sylvia Jesslitzie. Two years ago, when our 18th birthday, Sylvia Venus came into our program, talked about it . Parents are immigrants very traditional from Mexico. and they wanted to get married by the way, at babies. So they grew up in this country and she thought  an American girl, so she wanted to go to college and get into the job, all that before she started a family. Here's what she said at the first. My mom has lived in a box all the way. And sometimes, , what's her father? Escape from box. And sometimes, I'll just , , trying to find out what she's  pushing me in or trying to poke a hole in the box, and she keeps it right back. Sometimes we get to fight to my mom, I'm not  my cousins. My cousins are  19, 18 and they're ready for pregnant. Am I married? I'm , is that what you wanted to do with my life? At that time, Sylvie had a perfectly clear future. What she wanted to do, she worked in big open office. Lots of cuters, gadgets, doing computer animation. It feels  Jurassic Park and then in black. You must be needing a final computer and doing... all these things on the computer and the meeting and getting really frustrated because it takes me  six months to do  a five-second little scene and have a rock and I brought ring or something on how much hair or whatever color I want. After that interview, so you started an in-rounder office in internal in a show. Then she went away to college, the school which she chose because they teach computer watches the YouTube tech. in New York. She took one of our tape recorders with her and recorded now and then taped diaries, better experience and college and moments with her friends. We pulled some clips from the tape and I talked to her about it. So sharing my interest to a group part of it and , there's this kind of exact who , showed us to the boat house and oh my god, she was sitting at all this was amazing. The boat house had no lining whatsoever and above that you see stars. Massage starts  one or two stars, a lot of stars. And I looked up and I was amazed and I had the first thing I said, oh my god look there's a box apparently it's  the baked it for the little bit from my quite true. It's actually what it was. And they were kind of laughing and I was oh my god, the box you have a box with she there. Massage it's probably, it's been a good. And now it's against coverage when the proofing would be much cleaner. It's gotty. I'm gonna check the, , all in culture, I am. I know you from Chicago, so. Just all these people are, I really think, here's universal. This guy is just  a country, this guy type thing. Those have talked with someone and I'm in some of them are talking about me. Don't you remember I brought them in? I'm  a real looks. Yeah, fine. It's a safe thing. I do. Which is what it is,  if you didn't know. So, did you feel  your friends at school understand you? A lot of terms now. I don't think I'm going to see this sound of music alone and sound with them or something in a chocolate factory. I've never seen any of that stuff. And I'm just used to  going to an all-games school. where everybody speaks English and I listen, , , music is playing outside of a window, 24th time and they just , oh my gosh, she's so different. She's not , what we could love with, ? I just just just that little one with the learning to the bottom. That's when she was  sick. Not all the time. , the other thing is that way. Yeah, I do have the opportunity to work. I'm on the stage. Why? I turn right there. Brother and that's me. Hello. These are my great good seeds. Oh wow, they look so original, that was so cool. They look original, really not original. Oh wow. They look cool, I  their outfit in this thing. Yeah, that's a musician. Yeah, that's very Mexican outfit. Yeah, that's what I'm making very, to this. Lovely, it's nice. Have they been classes that you very long? ... isot... It is seperate. My visuals are quality class because for the first time in a really long time I felt  I can do where everybody else did was study in 1994 and get the exact same grade. that was the only class where I felt  I didn't have to try hard and get less grades. I tried to exactly see if they did and I got the exact same grade. I looked at class. You're saying you loved it because it was kind of easy. And I loved it because you had to do it in the graphics film and we had good. We decided to shoot drag queens and it was  the best thing ever  I went out  all the time  last week, we went out all the time to shoot them at to shoot  that to miss Rochester Miss gay Rochester catchin, the shadow method clubs and then dressing me and I came home drunk on top It was  the funnest thing ever I think that's why I  the classroom once I go back to that room get me How hard were you at your classes hopefully? They were hard. It just seemed  I'm a hard-earned. I never, I was never able to complete with them. I think if I ever had to do it, they were one-two. It's obvious I think it was a better school than I did. And I went to, I don't even bother telling them that I was one of my top kids in my class. I'm , what are they going to say? Do you work? But what's the hell helping? Here's a recording that you made right after you got back to school after going home to Chicago for some spring. I started getting a one-to-more cousin's baby show. Everybody was a green dog. So I had to go around the horn sharp place, , greeting everybody, the handshake. The kids, the hug, the kids, the handshake, all of a, it took me  15 minutes to figure everybody because there was at least , at 5, or 6, the wood. So I said then, we're all my aunts and cousins. And everybody in that table was married with kids. I was the only one without a child or a husband. And so we just , I was kind of bad. I mean, I just noticed,  nobody was in college. Nobody was going for a profession. I don't know what to do. I really don't. And I hear it. I hear that. , I spend most of my time. make a ranch as soon as I returned. Warning to you next day, why didn't he go with his family people? And then when I go to my family, I can't. It's , I spent half of my time. This family, or I'm from, and where I was raised in, and why I was raised where I was. And then I'm stuck here. And basically, the family and sometimes I don't even feel  I'm... He said, if you wanted to think that happened doing it first to your new old man's school at some point, you came back from and you went to the baptism of a baby who was a baby of a cousin who was. I don't know, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, which one I have to do with this? This is because of who's a husband's instruction and she works in it three rooms and he says, oh yeah, I can see that. Okay, so I got her house. Her house, she's 19 as the other house. She got her house and she lived next to a very nice neighborhood, not the far way from mine. And she works for a baby and gets an ex-pregnant money. And she only has a high school degree. She got married when she was , I think she had my two-weeks child for 17th birthday. She had her kid when she was 19. So she's having her daughters back to them. Yes. this beautiful house,  this  three bedroom attic and basement house, and as well I decorated it. And I think I'm , hello,  this is exactly the things that you tell you not to do because this is not going to help you. If you get married you're not going to have a house because out of a high school, the green you don't really make that much money from  why are they able to buy a house? And all I keep thinking is oh my god, I live in Rochester, I'm going to be living in that apartment as I call there with a roomy, . It was just , it was just  a pack stuff. , , I was already having problems with school. And then I come here and it's , oh, look, we . Did you  all of us who have ever told you that it would be a good idea to go with a college and green and light. Really? No, it's okay. , so something , I think they lied to me. I think they did. But I know  healing them happen right now are just ... but at this point I don't see the happening as I saw no noticeable. remember when I told you I picture the habit is huge  office with toys, computers and stuff  that. Yeah. I don't see that anymore. right now I seem  it's a scam else forward to something that's the most I knew enough to think that this, that that dream. If the habit knows... So, do you think it could be a quick advice that you're having right now? Try to move back to the neighbor and grow up and somebody can just have a house. Do you think it's a goal? You'd be missed? No. You'd be missed? What? Because that's not the life of a lot. It's  that's not the life of a lot, but this life isn't , you're already accepted to me, ? See,看, see. Stop. Hey, yeah. I hear you, I know. , stop. Well, time passed again. And two years after that, you were contributed. So, be graduated from the Winbur the WSRIT 2003.
