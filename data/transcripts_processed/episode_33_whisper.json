  "text": "Hi, Tyre recording this is 2006. But this episode of our show episode 33 is one that actually never was broadcast nationally. Do the local broadcasts of the Chicago and always suit it into the back to it, make it to national goods. In fact, we don't even have the master popularly, a digital recording of it, and what you're about to hear is actually from the set. We have the show, which is in the public. Anyway, here we go. I don't remember when I first wandered into the UNICEIRCLE. I'm sure it was after midnight. I'm sure that as always the place was mob. I'm sure that as always people were screaming. I need a boy and a diva! I need one! I need one! I need one! I need one! I don't know if you were going to fly. I'll try a boy and a cop! If I'm going to that top stand is filled with a swarm of people. But at first when, it was a weird mix of cop. There's a lot of cops there. Drunk you up each 20 somethings, working class people who work in the neighborhood. But we really got to me was the staff. There's one of these windows you can look through, , they asked me order through and they're in a space so small you could not park a car back there. It's hot, you can tell it's hot. There are deep fires and grills pouring off heat. It's hot grease everywhere and they have constantly bumping into each other, getting into each other's way. And all of them, all of them. are screaming, non-stop. It's kind of work environment to make sure you wonder. Only one thing. One of these people want to kill each other. I don't know. Where's it going? I don't want you to get your order. That's all I have. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. But if you watch the workers of the winter circle a little while more, you realize something else. Then she's in kind of happy. They're getting along. They kind of love each other. They joke around. I thought whoever manages this place, really knows how to run a restaurant, I mean they are taking a job that seems  one of the hardest, most grinding, physically and psychologically on your feet all day, yelling backwards and forwards, and somehow they have turned it into a job that the people there are. Actually, it seemed to kind of , I am more respect for this job than I can say almost If you want to be here, it's  you're not working for a monitor, you want to be here for real. Yeah, I'm serious. Well, WB EZ Chicago is this American life model class. Today on our program, a night at the Winter Circle. I was there from nine at night until dawn, a couple Saturday nights ago. I saw hundreds of screaming drunks, but I walked into the window. carrying a statue of Zeus for one bar to the next. I saw a couple of knees and foot and get together. The staff cursed at the patrons, the priests sang and songs. Sometimes they sang them songs mysteriously, I should say, in Hebrew. What else happened? I'm an exposed himself to the women behind the counter. At their request. And at the end of the evening. Everybody agreed for them. It had been quiet. Each week on our show, of course we invite a variety of writers and performers and this week our contributors gave us stories about working in the lovely food service industry, about fast food places, about meat. Anyway, stay with us. So let us go back now. Now we get sound transition. We're going to get the idea. But whatever, let us go. back now in time to a Saturday night. It is time to meet our cast of characters. There is Larry and Barry the owners of the Reiner Circle. Larry is a 50 year old man in Spandex Hans when he works Saturday night. He lives in the high rise across the street from the Reiner Circle that's on Clark Street by the way between Fowardton and Diversity. Larry goes on the lowest forest we can see in. Barry is 41, shot up from 180 pounds to 300 since they often hear that. circle, meeting the mistakes it says. In the last two years he's lost a hundred of those pounds. And sitting on the picking tables in front of the hot ducks and they laugh about all the excuses that employees used to get out of the word or played over the course of years. And I'm talking about this when right at that moment. The night shift Grimmett walks up. Welcome to our place where it's supposed to be in an eight of quite as motion and nothing ever end up without you. What's this about the hair, one of the excuses. Why you wear it? Why you wear it? This is totally yours. Tell them why you're supposed to be here and you're here at 10. What? That's right, but I don't even got found. I don't  the eye at all. See, that was one of the excuses. That's an old one. Thank you, anyway, Sonny. You're an old car. Yeah, because you're an old car. what I'm saying? I'm not saying that. I think you can see what had uptight about it. These guys are  the car guys. I don't know if you're getting rich. When they first opened the Weener Circle 15 years ago, this is the sort of thing showing up what they would fire people for. But they realized every time that it takes so long to train somebody that it just was not worth it for that, hire somebody maybe, they would have exactly the same number of late days and excuse us all that. So they have mellow, they have mellowed over the years, they view that as what they have they view that as basically they're experienced. On the Saturday night shift, there's also a book, there's Mary DiBerry. refuses to work the same shit as Larry does. There's Nani on fries, Tony on the grill, Patricia and Freddie at the counter with coffee, coffee's a person by the way. Coffee, this person is really famous Pat, but she insists on coffee because as she will be the first to tell you. Because that man says that. She's a, she's the very one. Everybody has the best of last midnight. It is coffee who sticks her long tongue out at less than not. It is coffee you can get the last word with any customer. It is coffee by the way who accidentally cursed out Lawrence fish burned this week in the restaurant. Not realizing who he was. The night I was there a guy walked in one point early in the night. It says to a coffee and Patricia who is standing behind the counter, you work here. And of course it's coffee who says, Oh no, we just stand in back here for decoration. The fuck you don't stand. You have it. The guys, spiders, newcomers to the winter circle, and usually are not prepared for what they get. Regulars on the other hand, come in all night and try to get the last word on coffee and on everybody else. But especially on coffee. Coffee is , , there's old westerns where they're , , the gunslinger who's the top gun. That's that's coffee. And that's the problem with being the top gun. There's always somebody who thinks, , that's the problem with being the top gun. There's always somebody who thinks, , that's the problem with being the top gun. the real quicker. Let's take what it is, being taught them. If they can score, if they can score a million S. That's the whole thing. I mean, I feel  I'm not doing it. I'm as famous as Michael Joe. Then it's Rodney. What happened? What happened? I have so much time in taste. He told me at each other. hours and hours of it. Coffee has four kids, the older ones have seen her cursing at the Winter Circle, and were shocked at first she says, but then they understood that this just has to use the work, and she does have another job she told me. I'm Haji, I'm free school just believe in her. Over the course of Saturday night these days, Winter Circle was mostly filled with yuppies, yuppies, 20-somethings, seriously drunk, it is not. Can I try to decide? countercult each other and themselves, bitch, mostly, as in. There are not many settings in our mostly segregated city of Chicago where you can see it. Room of mostly white, chocolate, boys, screaming insults, yelling bitch at women. Sometimes actually throwing money, literally throwing dollar bills. Add a coupreικάwehr , excuse me. Coming to the winner circle drunk they have license to talk in act  they talk in act nowhere else But when I asked coffee about it, she says it shouldn't see any big racial age workers on their job So life's most because she truly likes them and she says they don't go over the line She doesn't need this story about a white South African who came in and Miss interpreted the license that was happening inside the winner circle We said  he said to me he said You מ� as maybe you don't talk  that to me. Do  who I am? And when I first me first said it, okay, I was laughing at all because I always laugh. I  it somebody say, hey, black bitch, I said thank you, , you are dirty right? I said thank you, . So I thought it was playing at first until when he said something that wanted to cause me to lose and he was actually being bullblankiot crazy. It went down and when she was hectagen flat it was to the other white guys that you should come in, jump down and strive to fight. When they take their breaks, the winter circles they have to actually  each other. At one point I was talking to Vicki and coffee, and his coffee was talking, Vicki and reached over and wipes the pasta. Coffee coffee's cheap. Friday and Saturday night, some minutes of four working to winter circle has the intensity of working in emergency . the room. Except for course it's about hot dogs. And the winter circle staff has bonded the way that emergency room staff's bond. And it dawned after screaming each other on that long. I mean it sounds really quiet to say but they're really affectionable to each other. They have no anger left over. If you ask the customers why they come here, let's them say it isn't food and the employees. There is one man put it great incessantly at thought. It's dinner and a show. And some of the staff you would as a show also. And they said that if they weren't putting on a show, this would just be another food circus style. Pretty for example. Said that he's worked the days at the windows circle. And during the day, there's none of the sex. It's none of the screaming. It is a normal hotdog stand. Take your kids to. And for he said, it's hard to bear. But really, the hours drag by. it is not much fun at all. It's  you say, please thank you, have a nice day and all that. And during the nice , or want to draw on something, it's  playing all night, playing all night. Except you couldn't scream or it'd just be another job. Absolutely. Nice. Nice. Nice. past you, type of a devotional listeners. Do I have really amazing tape of other things to happen? That night at the UNESCO, Tipe of Vicky and Patricia and I are in the staff and then some of the customers who really had some stories to tell, I have to say, including, including, this is a hotdog stand, oddly haunted by David Schwimmer, for reasons I can't even begin to imagine. Those all suit the stuff of Chappinhof and then Bouteh? going into details I would just say that those parts of the story did not completely fit tonight show, but will be completed not to the stomach Saturday when we're talking about Democrats, but the what Saturday after that you can hear this and more and more and more a much more vivid little story. So let's go over to show up for that okay? Because there's a lot more to say about it for about I'm saying right now. And I want to share with you You see, we're gonna start doing something. You're so scared. Before that man, I'm gonna just give you a little bit of a smile. So listen to me now, that you have to smile. Listen to me  I need to come on. Hot dog, eat the baby nice, hot dog. Time, there was its lights, hot dog, pay it, go find a place. With the mustard and the rose, everything goes to hot dog. I don't want to hear much but he had dog. Me? He can't stop until I do. But he's me as to real because. With the mustard and the relish and the pickles too. Call. Say my soul. I don't quite want. Never let go. Something else might be the song of my hot dog. I don't hear much but he had dog. Hot dog, try to move your little brain hot dog Ooh, it's a different thing With the mustard and the relishers, it goes to hot dog And hot dog, it's hot dog Ooh, it's a different thing Hot dog, it's a different thing Hot dog, it's a different thing I don't have to, and anything  that. I don't have to, and I can have a wish. I don't have to, but I am full of my play. I don't. It's a thing of fate. With the voice to the revolution, the pickles to eat them and you get sadder and sadder and sadder. I don't have to, but I am full of my play. Act 2, the customer. We're first the relationship between staff and customers at the inner circle is not your typical relationship between restaurant staff and restaurant worker. For a more typical story, we tend to go awry with not only playwright and if we can contribute to our show but he actually works at a restaurant with many restaurants and has this story on Facebook. We're , guys, we're restaurant. And I possibly , nice phone. Which has a link in it. In our restaurant, restaurant workers give up names to favorite customers, or this is a much bigger cat food. Favorite customers to eat, be loved by. And the names usually come from restaurant habits. Private public with the seed lady, Mr. Saturday night, two-ash tray out. Or more potently and lively to stichorever, favorite food orders. The scone. always has one skull. It's always well done. He's a favorite with a spot on the restaurant workers' heart because of his consistency. That is their weed in this lake who always brings a shutter of an audience so deep that restaurant worker feels he was suffering stroke or a brain. Then weed is what about the soup? Then weed in it? The lasagna is there in the bread. I can't help you and I have half a book, not the medium book, or time book. I have it to go. I can't eat it here. Can you double wrap it? Can you eat it on the stove? I can't have it. Michael, wait. I can't have Michael, wait. Can I have some water while I wait? Stay with me. Let me just want to. Rest time alone, first. Don't block the door. Seast that is their weakness they've done. The mustard man is more deserving. Did. And the rest time workers wear this. The mustard man is a little dribbling. It's not flat. And probably harmless. He's pursuing to move on work now, but  a middle-age fat man's spot on a big cat-borne, a new line of work made outside to each. The mustard man studies the diet for the foot-school across the street where the restaurant works for works. The mustard man said, near member of that school's graduating class for the seven men. The quarter mustard man became the mustard man. He was at Typhine School. office to love your feet, especially if your feet were loved, your dance for shape. He would offer to work on your foot without batting her as if he were asking. That's the tension. And his food orders were almost all bent on the small foot, broken up, oddly shaped. Soup must be served first, but soup always served cold until the rest of the worker dissipated it, served that way, and then he, the mustard man, it's send it back with the instructions to... a new kid until boyway. And when that soup was bubbling  a lava flow out of Mount Suvius, the mustard nip and the top ice just popped out. Cers were worried over with hopes, deserted lees which included three. Four six changed ran awake or extra spoon, snive, and back, dishwasher, extra napkins, extra bread, extra extra extra extra extra. And every little variation in the order was announced with an increased urgency that intend on. the matter of fact. The mustard man's order of the scene designed to ask the restaurant on the field which is as many times as possible, and the longer the mustard can change the restaurant. The rags should be the business of one-seek for your fourth time. The more of the restaurant's work is trips, mustard tables have vehicles. The restaurant worker took an permanent look of that station, raged that only the mustard man seemed not to notice. other customers they githered from that book. They're bold orders for home, or group, used, foods, or cups, and tea. The rest is the home. That he had put one more straw on his restaurant, one more straw, and sped up by ordered real food as soon as he sends it of souls. But not the musk. The musk would continue his garage for a while, or a half-pressure ragano mint two pits, fresh bowl rolls, as the weeks one. The masterman seemed to settle in and he didn't feel at home. He started a table hop. Usually the other tables said, we're building other new graduates in the guidance school. Most of the students learned the students. They put short-warked views. And in our restaurant, the masterman's table hop. That was not. The students would cringe with this approval as you approach them. They claim this. science, feet, wild boys, manically grabbing it, any unprotected bird's stats, the composer needs to work on your foot or copy your foot. He will rotate his tailbone, so no one's feet will react to much of awesome. The restaurant workers, who support, he has to reach out and head into us. He is a lifeist, a team that works. That's the thing about restaurants, where restaurants, the workers need the customers. It's an unnatural relationship. You're there to serve them. Why should you serve them? Say, one, must, met the restaurant worker at the door. The restaurant worker is open on restaurant. And he's seen particularly happy. Must. Isll The entire man who arrived, the restaurant looked at himself in the box, and people attacked with Lord Muscle. The door opens and in-laws of a turn show performed. Now his voices, whispering with excitement, the possibility of using the place for avant-garde a rope you will contact while turkey and population part of his eyes. speak of wild parties while chirping more. His voice gets loud and rapid firing questions and the restaurant worker puts him on. Sifting on the point, the later date and the tape, blueprint proposal, at another time. Right now, the restaurant worker, he's running a pot of coffee and that coffee requires a lot of attention. Mustard. He jumps up there. Please take it. the potential perform on tour of the Ressonboarders' last time. Our Resson, the lovely stage, the handsome table cross, Chiu-Cou-Cou, and the two of them are constructing a loud tower of Babel that has the Ressonboard seeding. And is the most of them finally sports the potential perform of Outdoor, shouting, we'll get back to you with an offer and offer of what huge Ressonboard. It's the kitchen department. One last long look, rising down the potential performers' wing tips and wandering about the feet that they might hold. And then the restaurant anchor, Recting tab. In appropriate spew, boundary issues spew, spew, spew, with tension longer spew, self involved juggles, spew, spew, inappropriate inappropriate behavior spew, restaurant worker's name. Huffed up  40-40 minutes and a mustard dream and you cook. Spat. The mustard and the stock come to us. He still feels great. Now he never said. In every day. Ordering on bread, God would mustard to go. He became mustard. Bread, it muster to go place, eat some beautifuls, and restaurant worker. Every spokesperson thinks with ice, profession, a problem. Sometimes the mustard man would be young. The restaurant worker would look up, strangling, crude sand. Burning bagel together. The C-puster band is face-pusting, it's the restaurant. The white dress-front was in a pair of complex high-times. And the restaurant worker, I want to spare feet. The must remain with blood and skin. And the restaurant wants to find a must-beer, particularly well. It's face-pusting, it's the moon. The Royalty is running the Rhino fest and he works at the Winter Cabaret restaurant.

Well done. Let's open the tube. Ahh, how do I get stronger than it is. I think it would be more but I'm joined now in the studio by one of the public radio reporters here in Chicago, Sherley, Chicago, Sherley, and Hollywood. Can you tell us, Gudian? I know, I know. And Sherley, you've agreed to do a little assignment for us because hotouts in Chicago are not just who you are. They are a lens through which we can see the working is our great city. And I know that you have a story here of a company that did everything it was supposed to, here in the city that works, to grease the skids and see the things went well. It went in trouble. And finally, we'll say whether they're prevailed or not as the story proceeds. Go on in your 20th of the company. Well, let's write, I have where talking about Chicago's own Vienna B. Hot Dog. This is a very established company in the city. Been here for more than 100 years and  you said, they've done everything right. They employ 500 people in the city. They stayed in town and other people went to the suburbs. The head of the company, Jim Bodman, is a good corporate citizen. The contributor to all the right campaigns, including... Mayor Daley's campaign, Mayor Daley's campaign, who gives the maximum amount he can. Whenever City Hall calls, he says he responds as much as he can, he sends hot dogs to the parks for kids. He's even contributing hot dogs to the big media party, for journalists and delegates coming to the Democrat National Convention in Chicago. And every year he contributes to the City's big summer party, the City's best summer festival, the taste of Chicago, the City Christed Rory and Area residents and tourists from all around using his best. they ask us for money to help them do that and we give them money and they promise us that all the food that is served there will be our food and they put our name on bits of plastic example of you scratch my back and I'll scratch your back pretty simple it works very well So guys, playin by the rules. Everything's goin' just as it'ssty. Now this one I can pick up at the street a little bit because about a year ago I was having some daily decisions in general department's office on the BSX has become a little easy. two complicated to go and shoot here. And I'm sitting there and phone rings and it's somebody from the mayor's office and they want someone to have dog for a few minutes. Park, for some kids and Bob and says sure sure sure I'm in this risk as well. This is this. Can you can help me this name be pure thing? They're killing me on this navy, pure thing and I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Why we can't get our dogs out onto navy here? I would take this to navy here and hit that sound. Oh, let's hit it. the sound magic 3dL That was such a public radio moment wasn't it? Here we are on A.B.P.E.R. It's a wonderful place for summer fun. Can't have sales fairs wheel. Watch out for that key with that balloon, Shirley. It's so realistic. There's a lot of shops, a lot of food, , the water and the boats and what not. Let's call the Jews. Logo's Lakefront. It's this high traffic showcase area. Tourists. Lot of tourists. Lot of folks from the suburbs. Yeah. Lot of kids. Lot of kids. It costs a hundred million dollars. The taxpayer money bond money to build to re-verbush Navy pier. Right. And it was all carefully planned with businesses. We're going to go where. Now, Bobman told me that he couldn't get the dog out on Navy pier. Did he bid on the contract? Bobman bid 45 cents lower per pound for his dogs to be on Navy pier. And he still didn't get the contract. That seems to me to be not the way things are done. It's not the way things should have been done. Here in Chicago, somehow there's New York hot dog migrating into our backyard and it didn't happen by random curves. Somebody knew somebody knew somebody they said, let's get Charlie's hot dogs in the navy pier. We already have a big time. We'll see it's a very public place. Now if it wasn't rain, something happened, somebody said something to someone. That's the way the world works. And that's... where city works, the fix was in. Well, yeah, he doesn't quite say the fix was in. He just sort of leaves it at that, , I guess it's a part of Chicago code of honor, , in politics. You don't know nobody's sent. So he wasn't going to exactly tell me who that somebody wanted to somebody. He would not tell you. He would not say who was that, ? No. Where did somebody go? If I knew, if I knew I wouldn't cut it. Then when he worked on the pier? I might be a adult, seal. But I'm not stupid. I'm not gonna tell you. Yeah. I don't know. I'm not gonna tell you. I see there is a tactic you don't see many big corporate executives. You just have mock you and a call set up. That's true. I mean, he was a top one to crack. You think it wouldn't come forward to tell me the next. Well, that's our system. That's our system here in Chicago. So where'd you go? So of course we had to take the city hall. Bob and was talking. So we had to go to our city hall sources. And of course they did talk. They'll be in a whisper. I mean, they weren't, , they weren't free to say everything openly. They weren't talking on tape or anything, but , but off tape, my city hall sources did talk to me about this whole thing with the hot dogs on the pier and how it really went down. Okay. How come the Chicago company didn't get their dogs on the pier? I'll take you a name. somebody who was the person who was keeping us off the fear keeping our home ground dogs after they give your name we don't have a name we don't know don't have a name you said well what do we have but we do have some very important information it have confirmation as we say in the business we have confirmation because the city hall source has confirmed me that yeah this is how she called out works it's been this way for years and years and it's always gonna be this way he says it's not necessarily the best way but it is the way it and he said to me whoa The fix was in. I would say, I would say actually , given the fact that Fatherland did 45 cents less up pound and didn't get the contract, I'd say that I would believe that. I believe that. Okay, well we have confirmation. The fix was in, he says. And then he says, people need to be taken care of. All right. These are his words, not mine. All right. Then he paused though. This was the interesting part. He takes a pause. People need to be taken care of. He says, he. He says, and that's not necessarily a corrupt thing. So it isn't Chicago, ? It's a street today. Garbage picked up. That's good thing. That's right. So people need to be taken care of. That's hot and it's hot and it's hot and it's hot and it's hot. Is that what the least one of those people? He's one of those people at this point. He really feels  he needs to be taken care of. So it's a bit easier to be taken care of. feels  he's been left hung out to dry after he did everything right he gives to the mayor's campaign he comes when it reads called this is all and whatnot so next is so of course what's next in politics a meeting absolutely they call the meeting and all the players got together and so this is  one of those quintessential  she called those style political meetings you've all heard about them maybe imagine them  high powered we'll see the mayor's schedule for that day   11 to 11 30 hot dog meeting No, it detailed too small. So what do we know about who is at this meeting? Well, , we have conflicting information on exactly who was at the meeting on City Hall Source tells me the mayor was in fact at the meeting. But of course, this all important, high powered hot dog meeting. How many of this is it? All right. And so the bottom and insist know the mayor wasn't there. , he has more important things to do than deal with these we need problems. Right. Those are the bottom and so we can't not mind. All right. Why. was there. So who was there? All these officials from Navy here, the governing body of Navy here. Yeah. The state agency, the metropolitan here in the country. So there's some name  that. Yes, right. And see, so we got people from the state agency. We got the mayor. Or, and assistance to the mayor and all different kinds of liaison from the mayor's office. Right. We have bodies and in his people. And we have some people from the catering company that deals with contracts on here. Yeah. So  you say, it's one of those, . , your picture. That's kind of. He had pictures of a very high powered glamorous sort of thing. Did... Let's hear how Bond and Hell. Yeah, it was interesting. We were about 15 people who were, there was  a school board thing. Everybody likes to hear themselves talk. I'm so glad I was not there. I did not get mad at exciting. That's something you were planning. You were a school board meeting. I was just going to say, okay, so did he get satisfaction? In the end, Bondman says, does this deserve and now you can't hear listener get your Vienna? be taught on any here. Yes, just deserve to an assessment seed garden. I'll be seeing my dear. Without peppers, thank you. All right. Just a sister. You can't get your dog and maybe here now. You can get your dog on. Maybe here. That's our city. It's the city that works. It's a place where politics runs deep. They corrupt everything. It's in the air. You can't even see it. Even hot dogs. You've got to take it to the fifth floor. You've got to take it to the mayor's office. That's the way we're talking about. And Godman says, it's just business. It's not politics. Just business. The truth of the matter is that this is just the business. They were using hot dogs as we didn't  the fact that they came from a competitor and that's our economic system. You get in there and you fight and ask them to beg and we do whatever you can do that's legal and moral. And you try to get the business and that's what the other people are trying to do also. Did we use the political people to help us in that fight? You bet we did. We called them mayor. I would have called Bill Clinton at the edge of the telephone because that's a competitive blood flow That we gave the FACE OF!!! which did we didn't need fell. We needed rich and rich rich. I should say for us there's a handwritten course rich daily, the guys who helped us. We used them. We don't use them very often, but this is one kind that we did use them. But it was not political influences much as it was just seeking help for people who we felt comfortable. I just want to stop the tape right there. If that is not, I'm going to go with what is politics if it is not seeking help for people who you have helped before. Sounds kind of political. Alright, but not to say that there's anything wrong with that. That's something wrong with that. You speak all about Ford. All about Ford. We're doing a serious right there. Shirley, how are you? Thank you for helping us with this little parable of the city that works and exactly how it works and how it extends even down to the lowest bond. Thank you, Ireland. Thanks. , let's say thanks to Dick Pardman who really had no good reason. to talk to us. , that is a sign of a decent person, actually a listener for a radio station. It is a generous act. We're inside. Wait a minute. Oh wait a minute. Yes, ma'am. Sir, please. I want to be wide down. You can have your face and dice this problem. Have you ever danced to the upside down? If I'd be blind, just would say, I'd want a bank fat house of three Marbury, stakes, porn jobs, thieves, lay every hand, those things from uncle Say, when you take my fear and it goes to my head, I'd want a bank fat house of three Marbury, chicken and dog and turkey too, all vision perhaps an oyster stew, big 10 cents a profit kill from Sega, national term, to all-sular and have your long arms in a fancy bar. And you wait and just put a set on a make-fan hot dog three months later. Hey there's something that's coming here. Talking about she's gonna be winding down. She's gonna call me with my cousin's ass, me. Wait, huh? Will you be my glass fan of Big Man Hot dog? Yeah, I'll give you a glass fan. He's up right here with a big fan hot dog.

That was that's the most close off the name of the sound of the show next year with the center right now. Anyway so with that in mind we have a story about the center Smith without the meaning of one particular fast food and fast food is happening. On the 18th day in Japan I thought... finally broke down. Nearly three weeks and I refused all Western food, not a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I refused to be white bread. I'd even given up chewing gum. My hostess was worried. Breakfast American style? She asked every evening after my dinner of raw fish and shrimp. She had heard me gagging and crying late at night. No I asked. I was determined to live in each Japanese style. See you soon. soy sauce and rice, even the candy is made out of rice. On the 18th day at crack. On a back-streeting Kyoto, the smell of hot fried chicken sliced in a year. It was a siren, so a pie-piper that let me zombie  through the narrow streets. I thought of a bit brief. see fragrance and foul, jammed between the noodle shops and sushi bars, a safe haven. Here, on a main street in Kyoto, Japan, next door to the Monovutu, stood in outpost the civilization. I can tuck you fried chicken. The aroma of 11 herbs and spices pushed out in even there. Past gaysers on their way to working full of a gale, in career girls rushing home to take out sushi. Standing at the door was a... five-foot statue of the Colonel, who was dressed all in white and holding a gold-tipped cane. His eyes were slanted, and his cheeks round and red- sandal. But it was hip, Colonel, but his right hand raised in a sign of peace. I rushed inside. Once in, I thought a flood or relief. The familiar vinyl booths, the Colonel smiling face over the menu, which even though was in Japanese, I instantly understood. Rest in wing, sl... the cardboard box top open  a magic deal case. I sank my teeth into a breezy breast and beat the side filled with tears. When I finally looked up, I realized the restaurant was jam packed with Japanese eating chicken and this from a bright fluorescent light, they stuck phones and looked their fingers with gust of. The excitement was up. believable, and when I translated the cost of a snack box from yen to dollars, I realized that these prices, this was a serious night out on the town. Suddenly, the taste of the chicken with sour in my mouth, the Japanese believed in the curry. They think he invented this that was none with pure. This is my mind I wanted to scream. Black slaves! and visit this restaurant. You think that all white man stood over a wood stove frying chicken? I looked from face to face, the voice screaming inside of my brain. I wanted their ground to. I wanted credit for their greasy smiles. Look at me I wanted to shout, I'm the 11 herbs and spices. I'm the secret recipe. All around people were laughing at smack here and looking their fingers. And in the dark of the keyonal night, the bright white. a bright, stature of the Colonel, so I could be. Then I realized something else. This Colonel had destroyed my world and everything in it. Now follow me here. This is what I'm trying to say. I'm saying that to understand the history of the last 40 years, you have to understand the history of chicken. Kentucky fried chicken has wiped out a way of life, destroyed a cult. We used to be that every black woman in America. to have her own seat with Russ. But nobody fries chicken anymore, not when they could pick up a bucket for eight. And on top of that, chicken dinners with a foundation of an underground economy need a few extra dollars, sell dinners. We've experienced the hostile takeover of enormous support. Church women, reclaimed offices all night and sold dinners all day, they fed us and left our church is mortgage free. We've forgotten our residents. And a few more years with a curl and I'm afraid we might not remember him Sanctus oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh yeah put on come on my let's tear it off we've got something to do oh shit yeah put the souls down oh my god we have just give us a word and it builds you again I think this is what we have I think this is what we have oh my god I think this is what we have oh god oh my god I'm getting no good talk But you're my time to put now It's too dark I have to stop and do a band in chat Go, shut my sight You didn't know what I'm out of But the news that we're talking You didn't know I'm so grateful for some people But I'm a cast-door You've got nothing to do Oh, yeah You see I got more spice in the pool Go, hey Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it I think I'm  it Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it Thinkin'  it I'm , what do you got for me?

Man, I just felt I was many, what shocked you out of me and I did. Did I ain't the right way? I've never lived long, but  the top I did? You told me I was coming to Rome, touch the bed. You and I did, man. I thought I'd guess man. What do you want to make? What do you got to take? What do you want to do? What do you want to do?

Know your meat. This is all right. I remember red meat. In red meat's time, I live for marble meat and victory. Fatmen, winning. We had room for bounce. The flash of our fingers hold me over our sacred greens. Belly knock. eyes and double more smiles. In red means time we slapped it down the fry pan, for roasters, the groilers, through grinders, skipped the lying, seep big surface, that's life, that's death, that's the way it is, that's the way it's always been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it and I'll give you something to cry about. The men then were men and the women were bubbly, fuzzy, bubbly, impossible, cinched, chiffon, digging Ghanaot, Lovely, sigh high, long, line, nylon, fly, me to real, bubbly, excuses while we ponder on those. And in the under and the back, deals were made, featuring detail you shouldn't know about seal with the tight fiber of rare red news. Chased with hard, gold, liquor, unnatural leather and prayer. And the men shifted in the over-stuff chairs, fearing and loving their birth rights as men will stay that cup of glass. and a global-bundered intestinal tissue for a long long nap. Sites lasted body knowledge that ended it. Showing us how our hearts stopped too soon, our co-wind packed rock solid with the remnants of grand tours are reigned, this case with bad fats. Education's cried, rattle, and Nashville turnernives, so we searched for other stuff to see till we couldn't hear anything. Enter the principle, see the elf. course, pawn, cards, swordfish and soul that lay light and oil and sour on our plate. In sequence time, we trove light. You can almost hear the wind shine from the wall. The world was beige, the wood was blonde, and telephonic head is irretenticals and everything. We melted down to skeleton angles, laid out of the blends on our backs and stocked the mandatory carding. In sequence time ma- mesbr Then, we're men and the women we're so in, straight-haired and bare-faced, they grew tired of waiting for their share of the shren. Any male smile was sniffed and suspected of sexism. Sisters had been fooled before. Women pulled back into books and behind low-level masks, waiting for the moment when they would emerge people. the butterfly, pulled in back to cocoon in search of a grain. Something, shaken by the lost of their girls, who sideburned. and practically ran to make room. Others rumble the way, disgruntled, slamming their spikes tails against the volatile ground and hope that something would come from the backlash. The edge bled in the gray as we abandoned right or wrong in Zen cowardice, the sex was shuttered on exercise, looking hard to be eyed as far to the most in heaven. It's soon we discovered that seafood stuck more to it shells than to our ribs. and its bones were always problem. We never cheap in a land  weagants and took too long to cook, thrashing its death rose in mad, cool water. So we began to go on looking for the food that wouldn't scar us and along with in culture. Right, silly. Maratia was reversed. After all, did everything else aspire to taste  it? Culture gave itself up to us selflessly, blending perfectly in our eyes. dishes. In light, these beaks for moon, jutting, little monster, but in death, nude and hen from the dangles, poultry was considered enough to see that our blood kept pumping on the structure. In poultry's time, we fell back to livable winds, but not grossly slumped. So, and when it's fuel, we ran hard at what we wanted. The world was, the world was, well, we can't remember what the world looked . We never stopped long enough for the Boaここ from. blood blur. In poultry's time, the men were men and the women were men. Check the musculeter. See the stamina. We watched a women tour of stomach lining with the best of them. Or in their heads for fourth quarter figures and baby naked never thought wasn't there laughter the most false silk. Much  the scarves they wore at their last shred of sex kissed the kids and passed the popper caush there with work to be done. And men, feeling rushed and outroon, slipped into the hard sleek Italian numbers. Lead! of bloodless Pat Rylies, they began to look down on the downward for their models, not bothering to play by rules they kept changing, albeit you will both ski from the easy-to-trumps. In colds, in poultry's time, pork made a stab at such a claim. Stamping can speak  a nagging little brother, I'm white me, put me in, soach, but we do not be swayed. In the name of an U-Topia, it's Solar Nomunda six-wheat Robbins 16. Until we found out how it was cleaned. Oh, rather, how it wasn't cleaned. Salman Ellis story, another beastly factory. Jim fixed it up , why you job? What is this? Now promises we shend in the past. Now we wander lists to food. Nothing, no, just  once. Aska, the sometime friend, on fourth! It's quantity and we can never see the brain connection of all the common scientists. Our options are melting  squint ox and we are slipping to all world paths. Men and women are coming down slowly from your separate mountains. Sorry, really sorry for everything I mean. We are remembering the good news in each of our states, the mountains and in all.
