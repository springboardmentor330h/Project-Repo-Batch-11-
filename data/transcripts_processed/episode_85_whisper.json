System 3 branch watches at the bird's suit count fish, fig wrap fish, the Ego chases them, steals the fish. Awesome. It's Howard. At least, that is the argument that Benjamin Franklin was out in the letter. It did. January 26, 1784. It would be far better. The symbol of the new United States America were a turkey. Right, right? Well, Turkey isn't comparison in much more respectable bird, with all a true original native of America. Eagles have been found in all countries. Turkey was mature at ours. He is besides, though it would obtain and silly, a bird, a courage. And would not hesitate to attack Grenadier and British guards, who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on. Modern American reads this and thinks, ...rude a courage. Well, yey! , the wild turkey of the 18th century was very different from the butterball turkey of the Soviet Union. That's right here, it's one of our contributing editors here at the American Life. He's written about the Benjamin Franklin papers and he's got his story by all of the people who are doing something else. He wants to create his national magazines and they have to explain this turkey mystery. He looks at the label of the wild turkey bottle. He's probably closer to the manufacturer's turkey than the one in the grocery store. It's all leg. It's fast, it's speedy, it's an athletic bird. It has almost no rest whatsoever. And if you've ever hunted them, they're incredibly quick and smart. Whereas over the centuries, the turkey was eventually bred into this enormous, walking piece of breast meat. The turkey itself is so... front heavy I think in some cases even have trouble walking towards the end you're saying that we as a nation have altered the turkey oh a smart fast cunning animal into a stupid heavy what we've done really just hybridized to the point where it's just basically a living dinner waiting to get on the table there's really nothing about the turkey from its birth to death but is it about anything except And  that's the thing about culture. There probably more than any other animal. We have turned birds, chicken, turkey, and what we want them to be. Which means the chickens and turkeys, more than other animals, are a mirror of ourselves, of our desires, of our needs. When we tell stories about poultry, we're telling stories better and give them this and give them the history of the turkey and America. Maybe Benjamin Franklin was right, maybe it should be. The symbol of our nation. In a way, it begs the metaphor. I mean, he's saying that this should be the symbol of our country. And I wonder if he could show it. Do you think what you think of the United States for America? You're saying that if we had chosen a 200 years ago, it would have neatly tracked our sort of our national growth. Are you saying that now we're more  the contemporary Turkey than we were when Franklin's Turkey? I guess I am saying that we're fat and out of shape and lazy, somewhat retarding. I mean I admit it's a little post-beat, nom, syndrome. I mean it's a guest, a single unfashionable post-beat, nom, syndrome. But... Welcome to WB EZ Chicago and Public Radio International. This American light, pirate glass, and we, all of us, we stand at this moment. Poised between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but you're in the weeks during the year when Americans consume more poultry than at any other time Which means it's time this American life's annual poultry slam stories by chickens turkeys ducks fall of our kind and the mysterious hold over us That jacket although you're happily and had a bidding Discussing a Ben Franklin and turkeys that is not the reason why you're here with this No, near for another cool thing. Let me just ask you to just give us a little hint just drop a phrase or two. Two words are chicken. Chicken, little. Adults all over America are turning off the reels. You think chicken, little is that much of a draw? Let me try that again. Two words are. Even Super Numbers. Well, I have one of our programs today, Chicken Diva, in which we hear the story of Yes, Aby and Supermemories. Back to Headless Chicken in Topless Bar. Actually there is a topless bar in it. I was just saying this sound about it. But there is a headless chicken and a question. What does the headless chicken say about us? Back to Headless Chicken in Topless Bar. My glue is to explain the natural way to hunt duck. and his family's way. At four, trying to respect the chicken, story of one woman's quest, to give chickens the honor and dignity they are rarely accorded. Even though the chickens resist her efforts, say what else. At one, chicken diva. Chicken's are what we make them, for for their own sake. We have this story, so much to be here. or check it. It wasn't Susan Chickens. It was Kennedy. It was about a work backstage of the movie The Secondary Why in New York. The town's was filled with chicken cups, chicken bags, or some chickens. He got the whole staff on the chickens, including Susan. But at the time there in the 80s, poultry related jokes and references, he came the fast way to get the laugh of the wine. I guess most of us are in Tennessee, nothing more than the easy company chickens. But Susan for teaching, so also. their potential greatness, their hidden beauty, their grandchildren. One day she glued together some finger puppets for a ten minute rendition of the chicken with the story for her nephew. That was 14 years ago.

It's still performed finger puppets, but now it has a complete score written by a person. In a quick, but it dreamtles. This is... hit on Godwin musical called Sajj.

It's a good sight of the dead raised goats, pigs, about a hundred chickens. They would slaughter the birds by chopping off their kids for an axe. We're gonna get it. a little bit of a little bit of a twist of your soap. It's a little nerve-wracking because as soon as you cut the head off a second or two while I'm having the chicken kind of explodes, it starts to spazz out. And sometimes they'll just lie on the ground kind of jerking and moving. But other times they'll actually run and hop. And it's quite a sight because they're headless. Well, that is coming out of the top of their neck. I mean if you have ... 30 of these to do, they're going to sort of disperse over a pretty large area. And I can remember chasing them, and frequently they would do a facet maneuvers when you would try to reach out and grab them, they would jump to one side, and it's seen almost as if they could tell that you were there. Which they couldn't, they didn't have a head. We tried all the different techniques to deal with this kind of messy situation. And I can remember one time we would throw them, we cut the head off, we'd throw them into a 55-pound tromb. But that was kind of a mess, it was really noise because they bang around and you can only put so many in there in the bloods, they're so black and so that was really that didn't Remember one time my uncle, Lewis, he was helping us do this and he had heard that if you break the chicken's neck as opposed to cutting it off, that somehow circumvents the reaction and they don't spas out. So he felt that the way to do that would be to grab the chicken by the head. swinging around his head and he picked one up and swung it around his head a few times and sure not, he almost did and he didn't go to this reaction. And so he stepped back and my father took him and did the same thing and as he swinging around, he looked over it, close and I noticed that there was this line of chicken that was going across his glasses because the bird had gone to the bathroom while I was swinging around and so we didn't really try that anymore and we went back to the fence method. If you spend enough time around chickens and you are a halfway empathetic or observant person, I think it's inevitable that it's certain times in certain ways, the boundary between the human world and the chicken world. Okay, what? That happened to me. Chicken's there. Very high, R. And the higher chickens, well the chickens want to get to the highest part of the roost and so there'd be constant fighting to get to the top kind of chickens standing to each other, pecking each other. There always be one or two chickens that had very few feathers and because they were always being picked on, hand packed. They were the bottom of the pecking marker. And these chickens, I felt, I thought it would make sure I felt it. sorry for them because it looked very uncomfortable and I didn't  to see them suffer. But I also felt the kind of, they have evoked a bit of anger because they were always kind of hanging out in the corner or underfoot and they didn't go out in the yard usually. They were just kind of hanging out inside the house and, and frequently, I think they just brought out the sort of bully. in the 10 year old boy. I had some anger that I would kind of, I remember she and I went with these hem tech animals, would bring it out in me and I would check them away and say we're underfootens, stuff  that. It was a mixture of feeling sorry for them and killing the rich. One way to look at the work is this, there's a light continuum. On one side, at the extreme act, you have plants and insects and stuff that most of us feel no remorse about killing or mistreating. On the other side of the continuum at the other extreme, you have dogs and cats and baby seals and human beings. Because we do not feel free to just care or either be cruel. And the question is, where are chickens working on this continuum? A different point during our conversation, where we put chickens at different places on the continuum. Sometimes he said that he felt their pain, he empathised with their pain. Sometimes he went on his own, high rates, and then asked stupid chickens on. The thing about chickens is saying  eating eggs, but they don't know that the things they're laying are eggs. You get the occasion of chicken that will be eggs from the egg. areas where they  them, but by and by that's not that common. But if you take an egg, throw it on the floor, all the chickens will run over and eat it. And that's hard for it! , I'm feeling, I am feeling some anguish about how I treated some of these chickens.

One family's mortal reckoning loopbirds and brown socks. We have a lot to add to that. Every other year, a surgery, Christmas vacation, I stuck myself into a camouflage suit of goose down and rub, strike out with my father and a few of his friends with swamps of Southwest Louisiana. For nearly 20 years now, I have followed into the darkness as blindly as Isaac followed Abraham. Stop waterfowl with gunk, trick or bushes, saw grass, prick mud, snakes, mosquitoes, wild dogs, and even the odd î swhat, direction, eze him. Everything that will lead to a swamp seems slightly unpeased and unpredictable. Seems almost natural, man. For example, the common cow, charge and harm, man, is fiercely used the rabbit charge to be Carter. Forcing the chew, with the humiliated death. And the dignity of shooting a cow, self-defense. But of all the right from the swamp, yeah? his pipe so transformed by the price as the otherwise intelligent demon did. I'm so sure of the elusive word of power. I suppose I should say that I see nothing in moral. So I often have sensed mild disapproval of people who do not have people who did. As they sliced deeply into the flesh what was once an adorable little man and then carried greedily with their back teeth. These people will say something , I can even kill a cute little duck. The honest answer is, SAF. that I doubt. Looking back on it now, I believe we began two decades ago with the ambition of one day becoming tourists. The hunting tourists, they able to make themselves clean and feel  a duck or a goose. The enters this swamp it five in the morning with ten shockers shells, and returns three hours later with his legal limit of pre-ducks. Sam D's. He can. In car of wooden ducts, so similar to live ducts, they need to ducts down notice the difference. And make noises with his mouth sounds so much  a female duct on the make. That male ducts flock,  sailors to a broth. I confessed there was a time when this scene important to us. In some of my earliest memories are of my father sitting on our back porch, emanating for hours. Hey for 40. Dr. Mating Coast. But over the years it became clear that no matter how long we practiced this in our species for a patient, we would never score. As this truth dawn, you'd began visually to fill the gap between our ambitions and our parents, with the latest and hunting technology. Unable to speak with the birds, we communicated instead with each other. We carried walky-talky so that we might fan her in the swamp and we'll treat each other very sparkly. We carried flas at the better sea each other in the dark, and then they were the more adventurous techniques. In the late 1970s it was widely believed, for example, that to a goose flying high in the sky, a balled up newspaper resembled a sitting goose. For several years we spread the Wall Street Journal across Louisiana wetlands, fully believing that a goose would spot the stockpills, or perhaps an offer worth, and dive down for a closer look. And for a while when we are nothing to show for this but a saggy mass, we move going from newspaper to life size plastic replicas of geeks. When these also fail, another period soon made the rounds. Geese  size perception. A goose the size of the world trades have looked to a goose,  just another goose. And so for the next several years our plastic replicas are the geeks. Well, three or four times the size of a lot gives. The added size did not help as far as I could say. And we now do understand how many beliefs about these would lead us inevitably to embrace the Trojan Goose. The Trojan Goose was advertised by one of the many companies, specializing supplying the binoculars? The cultural training at the first round, onto a radio station. A radio station of 506 million electron ion infrared automated ions, motion presenting sensors taking over WhatsApp wiring or mundane testing connections. The glass cool down was a slightly dull possibility that the bodies would be It was, as it sounds, hollowed out replica of a goose, complete with eyeballs and margin of two-hundreds to stand comfortably inside of it. It was meant to be a record in middle of a goose feeding ground, one winged the sky to kind of door. The idea was that once the geese gathered around in a dark-dance-leaf cup, hunters might throw up in the trap door, storm out into their unsuspecting nest, and visit a spot near In sparked by worry and an 180 hrs. the person's approach to use. However, something here, I'm not sure why. Perhaps some combination of self-revolge and self-examination. At heart, we realized, we were not technologists, we were spiritualists. The spiritualists is a hunter who has learned to shift the emphasis of the hunting away from the killer.

We have come very far these two years. A few weeks ago my father set off one morning run put through the swamp.
