There are close-ups of body parts. To say, as you just  through these things, this is the grizzly sledge over the scene, it's  every side is some, and there's another story, yes, everything, times is a story of a child. is a novel. And it opens up the never-direction. The illustrator tells me this story. When he worked for the Wayne County Carners Office back in Detroit, he was a young woman. He's straight by the way, might not be suitable for many children. Anyway, there's a young woman who apparently killed herself by taking her boyfriend's gun, putting it on her mouth, and firing. Please, the other medical exam, and every little bit of suicide. Something  the case father doctor's physician woman didn't have a history of depression There was no milk my colleagues Jesus being paranoid seeing things where they were not I Did the examination and did the examination the all cavity and in this particular case They're done True hold This is our strange undergrad which explain because usually You can discuss a little explicit usually when people shoot themselves in the mouth You kind of point it done upward for the brain The tongue does not get injured at all It's here the tongue must have been all bunched up pushing hard against the muscle of the guy Now who do this world trying to end life? Will Click a visual ink I'm shoving Arms in the glass I was in another place. In my assessment of this, this was a harvison. So, I told the tech kids that that was my fine. They went back to the board. They said, we know the future. Sick. Well I didn't. Yes, we know the doctor told us. He said, what the? She said, doctor, the did the audits. Said, what audits? I call the coroner's office two weeks ago and they told me they never did audits. Good. Why call the coroner's office to ask that question? If you're not planning on telling me about me. He did not take very long to please. to get a confession on the sky. As I could practice which says, every crime scene is novel. Today in our radio program, crime scene, and the stories behind them, the BB-Ezish cargo, and public radio international, American life, my request. At one of our shows today, how do we know forensic criminologists explains exactly what it is that we can learn from evidence at a crime scene. Back to, Grimes scene. And see you up there with quotes on how watching the movie, hope fiction. Let one man to arrive coming in after the police and the investigators are done. I agree. I'm saying after our show I have to say everything gets a little less brisly. Actory, a criminal returns to the scene of the crime. The story of a thief who returns to the neighborhood where he robbed and con people. Coach Littleie. That poor, what police cannot do. We have this completely beautiful haunting story. Any tender, better go to boy who can find. any lost object and still enough. Many crimes and statements. At one, how do we know? Well, we thought we would start the server with a quick primer on some of the kinds of evidence that investigators find at crime scenes and what it tells them. And Rika Tugnary is a former forensic criminologist in Nevada. He says there's a lot of information contained in something similar as the shape of bloodstained. It's about high velocity, but it's things, low velocity, but it's things. Well, the blood, bloods pattern, when you have a mobile office, I'm  an arterial cut, where somebody is cutting the artery, it's actually spurting out of the body. It's fairly large thing. These things are, if you're a predator blood, cool now, if you're a predator mobile loss, a higher loss, if I simply be using it with a baseball bat, the deer drop shape, the lower the angle, the more the deer drop. It's straight on as we can. and then if you have high velocity which is gunshot, you almost get a mist because of the impact of the gunshot causing an exposure blood to your very fine mist. And then it's in the shape of the fabric that you can tell where the person is seeing. Yeah, it's basic trigonometry that you need to take the width of the blood stain and the length of the blood stain and you find the angle and from the angle you can actually strain it. she's going to string back, away from the wall, then we determined it to impact it at. And if you do this from several little droplets, you eventually come to a point where they bunch up. And that would be with a blood impact actually originally. Those are the case where an individual had said that he had to a 5-way roomate and as there's standing up and he hit the guy in the back behind his left dead. We did the gallery room to start the bloods back by streaming. We just showed it all came from a fairly low place in the, on the floor, from a few inches up from the floor. And we just showed it mostly in the back side from the individual body down. So they're particularly related to self-defense. And then we see this kicking in my body as I said on ground, that's correct. I didn't see the list people, all the things you can learn from all the presents that are there at on a scene. I'm not sure, , the certain new team things you would look for and let's see you get into a scene where you're still so on a crew on the table. You want to see if it's still war. You want to see what the food is. You want to see where the placing of the utensil can be. That might give you a clue whether it's a right hand or a left hand or a person that was last there. You want to see it. actually observe everything that's there as far as you see any blood and hair and find it. It's a police officer who was there, Prime Minister, Dr. If If Ister, even one of the witnesses you got there first. If you can get them to the scribes and we need smells, the smell could be important, no, but the cigar's low. You never know. If you can remember, can you think of a case where an utterly ordinary object enter a plane that is a looser, that Well, the fact was a burger with a piece of cheese. They had a two-market and we were able to mass the white mark to be the individual that we've been booked for. Why? Just the piece of cheese left in the refrigerator. The individual decided to help himself so food. And he took a bite out of a piece of cheese. And he had you need to mass the white mark that we were able to identify. When the police are down with the quarantine, who actually cleans up the quarantine? Usually the person who owns the property, we would market as a possible biohatter, and then the individual would hire, we would over the art, and from now. Other drivers stare at Neil Smithers' truck and sometimes take pictures. On the sides and back of it, in big red letters, is the company made. Prime scene cleaners, specializing in homicide. sides, suicides, and accidental deaths. But this is Nancy Updike, and she's active to her show, at two grinds and... Nancy wanted to San Francisco Bay Area to see Neil Smither, who comes up grinds and is further away. Quick warning, some of this might not be suitable for young prisoners, the screen-ish and will soon. After spending two days with Neil Smither, I was this close to signing up to open this Los Angeles franchise. I'm not joking. Neil spends all day every day speeding around in a huge white pickup truck with a cell phone group to a beer making sure his company gets to dispose of every drop of blood within driving distance of a rindic California and his franchises in Utah, Kansas, Texas, Las Vegas, and Alabama. Mostly he doesn't need the truck. He's had this one for about a year and it's got 90,000 miles on it. Neil is absolutely blunt about his job. The point of crassness. I did a job one time. Old guy dropped men. Do you compose on this kitchen floor? So when we got there, we had a 10 by 5, but square pool of just the ore. No power in the house. It's dark, very quiet. I'm in there with a respirator because it was just, , and it's snow. Here in the snow, as , I shouldn't be here to know it. It's no power in the house. Nothing. I get a flashlight. And there's a pumpkin. The always, man. Is that? So you're closer to go with my light. It's just going all sides Think of maggots and everything around in the blood and the gore and sounds  when you need hamburger The maggots were making a sound. They'd be so many of them just so many of them Ripping around this board a gore that got you The only time you speak gently about what he does on sales costs Either this is really not good Yes, sir Yes sir. All right, that's all you need to tell me. Let me kind of watch. Your hell we work. We have a crew to eat within the alley. They'd write you up a free estimate. You'd  the estimate. They'd rock and roll and send you on the right. So this is the first time. By the way, you noticed Neil Southern accent made it up. We borrowed it from his Arkansas grandparents so he could play steel magnolia during business negotiations. We grew up in Santa Cruz. has no problems admitting the accent is cultivated. Some of our southern voice just kind of opens up a trusting vein, ? Which is correct, I mean that's what I want. Neil has that tightly wound energy  Jim Perry. He's 5-5, the short-brown pair under a baseball cap, and sunglasses. He smokes pools, does not stop for lunch, and drives way too fast. Directness. the pressness is all deliberate. It's his marketing strategy. Gorsales are going to trump where we're pretty upfront. I hope I don't offend too many people. I just try to try to be honest with them. I mean we're dealing with death. How do you sugarcoat death? , you can. Neil describes for me the outline left on a feather couch by a body that is decomposed into it over the course of 60 days. And I want to stop here and acknowledge that this is... gross. It is. It's gross. But it's interesting. And to me, it's much more interesting than it is gross. I mean, think of it, a melted person. Four years ago, Neil had never seen a dead body. He's a laid off mortgage book, not saying. Then he saw a pulp fiction. Remember that scene where John provoked the blows the guys head off back in the car by me. and they have to call in Mr. Wolf to fix everything. Hey, you two folks, do a stick to us being close. The lady has started to come. And it's going to backseat. Scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Meal is possibly the only person in America who saw that scene and thought, wow, I want that job. And it turns out, it is revealed job. If someone dies in your house, it's up to you to get a clean. But doing it yourself, even if you wanted to. raises all sorts of problems. Are you complying with the state and federal laws governing the disposal of bodies and bodily fluids? Do you have the proper permits and my ability coverage? No, you don't. So you call Neil. Here's how his job breaks down. Murders are released of his business. Most of the cleanups are either decops. Bodies that have sat for a while and started to decompose. I did a deco on the very ununit upstairs, there are no better. How long have you been going? on the server with on what are these all-homong negative words to will become. Or suicide. Suicide and attempted suicide are surprisingly big particles job. The rest of meals business consists of meth labs and kitty houses. Kitty houses are those places usually for old newspapers and other garbage that have dozens of cats everywhere, eating and pee at the craft. Meth labs will usually hotel accounts. Plony houses too practice. change and contract. Hotel rooms get used all the time to put Math and Fettamy Neil says, he does a lot of business in hotels. He claims, paper ballerically, that there's no hotel in the country that hasn't had a murder or suicide in one of its rooms. The second day I spend with Neil, he gets called out to a jail to clean up actor or woman who tried to fill herself in the bathroom off the prisoners waiting room. I'm not allowed to record anything. Let's get back. just wash. I held open the bathroom door with my foot while Neil sits up his stop. Next to the sink are several thick dark red drops of blood and there are a few streaks of blood on the wall. Inside the sink is more blood. It is no lot, maybe a third of a cup overall, but clearly she did some damage. Then while Neil is getting into his protective suit, a woman in the waiting room behind us, a weaker and here can fire to move later, meeting a math user. Reads the bed. back of Niels shirt out loud. I'm seen cleaner as she says. You clean my mother's house. Niels turns around. Yeah? Which one was that? Without any emotion, woman says her mother and cousin were murdered by her mother's boyfriend Yelko. You guys cleaned the house, she would be. Oh yeah, I remember that one. That was on the news, Niels sense. and nods and doesn't say it. So Neil goes back to cleaning. He whips through it in about 10 minutes,  it's spilled milk. In fact, it's exactly  cleaning up a nest home, except with industrial strength cleansers on equipment. The snaps on some rubber gloves, sprays the whole area with a special enzyme to neutralize the blood and kill any bacteria or viruses. Scrubs any tough spots with a little brush, and then wipes everything clean with heavy due to paper towels. It's hard, just depressing. The bottom line on the business man, I'm an entrepreneur. I want you to make money, build my company. Will you  this as a kid? Well, I was the kid in school who would buy buss and blow-pops and bring the school in Selenett lunch. , I... I was a kid at school who ran a lunch ticket scam. , well, this is the lunch ticket scam. I had a girlfriend in the office, , the head off some high school and she'd kicked me down with lunch tickets for a discount of price. And I had to sell them for the police price, but it was still lower than what the, , the Mexican kids who ever could buy them for the school. So it's fair I'd be at school by 20 cents a ticket. I think, well, high school career, I'm blow-possing lunch tickets. Beautiful. I always had money and I didn't break any lofts, didn't slow them to go. I got that ****, got my own car and I banked all the wood blow-pops and mushy. Meals plan is to retire in seven years, afford and be rich. But in the meantime, the job is changing him. Seeing so many crime scenes, seeing the way so many people die. He's also seen. how they live in houses filled with cold newspapers, dirty dishes, and too many cats. Never clean the bathroom. I think more than anything now, most people are just dirty motherf***. We live  animals, man. You have no idea. I'm a clean freak. My place is spotless. , so I was, when I got into this, I was shocked by the way, people live. It's amazing. I went into a bathroom yesterday at a car wash, right? I entered. doing a business and I walk into the thing. The guy thrown his garbage on the floor, didn't flush the toilet, just common, no common courtesy at all. And he was in a tie and a clean guy nice look, you guys. Did you want to teach you anything? , you four-year-old dirt bag. Are you just a dirt bag? That's dirt bag. Straight up. That is a dirt bag. Did you think people were... this big dirt bag before this job. No idea. I had no idea. I thought, , everyone was normal. , believe me, the normal is the dirt bag in this. But now you seem more dirt baggy everywhere. I was 80, 20 dirt bags. You bet. I swear to God. Now the home. to take a hot shower. , convert to bathtub, read my book, not thinking about your bags. With my girl get home. Wait for that. You can have for my girl 11-bone. Neil thought a lot about his own death in the last few years. Not surprisingly. He says he wants to die slowly so he can say goodbye to everyone. He doesn't want to be found by a company  his and cleaned up with his family off somewhere wondering what happened. He doesn't even care if it's a painful death. He says, as long as it's slow, cancer will be fine. He says, he take cancer. When was the last time you heard someone say that? And see how big is producer for our program. We heard about Neil Smith from the book, GIG, which is an unofficial sequel slash tribute to Steadstirkel's classic book about Americans and their jobs. Working. On metal, I still think violins read America's resume on the What the hell are you doing? I'm getting it! I'm getting up no more grip. Christmas promise. And what's the name when you get at a prison? Kick your drug habit, return to the scene of your crimes and little kids make fun of you? Hidden Garden Khan. In a minute. Probabrigating or conventional when our program. Disnerking life from our class. You treat the question to something when you're a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme that is program. Crime scenes and stories they tell. We've arrived at a three of our show at three returned to the scene of crime. There's a truce in an detective fiction that a criminal always returns to the scene of crime. But it turns out we've really actually not very common. It may be among arsonists. Arsonists  to see the fires they set, apparently. And some of them are caught when police look at pictures taking into the crowd for various fires. And then, maybe it's very rare, maybe not, nobody really tries to speak anything. There are the people who circle back to the similar crimes to undo, to erase something, but we still don't have to happen. Hey Davis, discovered that one of Ron Neighbors from Washington, DC and all friends, trying to be just all. Bobby comes up in the street when I think he walks. I haven't seen him for months and he's kind of blinding the long, smoking the wall. That's the way he's heard himself since six days in my first mettle, one of the bad boys from Mobile and Tell me. Bobby tells me he's going to coach a little lead to this immediate case. Bobby, I said, come up on my porch. Inside and think he's using to. This rail, thin, sweating, it looks  it's been used in only. Bobby Flitz is burning cigarette into the student watches him, waiting for more reaction. This is the same Bobby I loved and tried to save for a whole year. Bobby who stole $60 from my house to buy heroin and swore to God, swore to his own dead daughter, and my dog purried into the money. And this is his latest home to the country, coaching a bunch of 10 or 11 and 12-year-olds, and I'm gonna buy the DC department. in the recreation, all I can say is, let's see. A week later, Bobby's gone. This time on my machine. You have two messages. That's it. One. Hey, I don't know how to say hi. And I want you all to probably work very, very good, but run up to the key to say hi to you. And you can see this now. This time. I got her, I believe, but what I'm trying to do is that she's there, and I'm gonna go up the level of things, I don't think I can hear her acting as, , do it's teamwork with the questions, ? My machine cuts him off. But now I know Bobby's came. Because if you were still using her own, nothing could function as detached to you. You sound in the way you can write. Bobby has spoke two and a half years in Morton Prison, I was Salt and Possession charges. Maddoe by Bunch of Kids at the first place. first thing crazy. We went to Harrison playground and 2013-14 on V Street and that's rough rough neighborhood. And as soon as we got on the field my kids started to act up right away, right away and I think they were afraid. I was in a little afraid. Okay, he was  tickling. Ooh, it would blow me. I thought it would ever. But then up. everybody just yelling and saying no. I don't get them to chill over the night. You play ball, focus on the game. They started cursing me. I've fewer than cursing me and cursing me. Curse me. You tell the one kids did at me. And he got mad and said, practice is over. And I curse you and I thought about it. They didn't get impressed me. before they were born I was in penitentiary. so if they're trying to act  they're bad they're not impressed. And right when I did that I felt my gut that I could screw them. I felt right there and  what you just laid all of your cars on the table. You don't have a whole car anymore. Now they know you. The Shannon said maybe you got coffee in the foot. But last night. And that way, by the way, was Latin. One kid says, well, while you were in prison, where you're getting home, then I knew I asked you that. I said, no, that didn't happen. Now, that's all because you were the hope for it, right? Three days later, they hold second practice. This time, it had been a field in our movie. But I was back for more South Washington, little. So fast, let the shit out! What's your strategy? Or do you maybe you're forming later? I'm formulating it, but my strategy... Sorter is to... My strategy is to... to remember on the adult. Hey! Good stick, go, go, go, go! We're running out of my foe, my practice act! Alright, good stick, good hop! Hey, every practice is always good. This second practice is good. the only tantras being flown nobody kids. Bob is stands by the backstop in our heart pushing away a low-piss sapon, and it's flown up to the fence. There are no bases and only a warp piece of rubber for the pit is now. That's how it goes around here. Anyone with any money drives their kids to the wealthy or the hoods to play, leaving this machete and field for Bob's team. Come on, man. I'm not going to tell you where it's going, but I want to be free at home when it comes to you. Wake up! Wake up! That's what I'm saying, see? You got any game? The battle's not gonna tell you where the ball is going to go, guys. Tell it level. Tell me, bad news things. They're horrible. This ball is talent. I think the one thing is, I'm not gonna do that one. But guys, man, they can't throw a ball. They can't catch ball, they can't hit a ball. And they never lose it. What's that? Right home. Oh, okay. You got good stars to throw. That's the way to play. They're going to play. They're all playing. Let's start with your work. Yes? The third practice starts around five o'clock on a humid April afternoon. Kids are scattered around the room, squatting down, pulling their gloves. Joey is throwing mocks at his breath. Joey is always in the box. Benjamin thinks he should be pitching. Bobby tells him to stay right where he isn't. He's not. That's what I'm talking about right there. Come on, Ben. Come on, now. Get that ball. . Oh you didn't know. I do know you need girls. And on that fall. Burn hole. After half hour it seems start to spin out of control. Benjamin the most volatile of the kids throws a rocket choke. Bobby tells him to run a lap. He must be tripping since Benjamin. I might be tripping that you need to be lap and says Bob. You don't make me want to lap. And I need to know that. And I need everything. Benjamin, he's my favorite because I just see me. I just see me. more so than any other child on that team. I don't know what his home life is , but from what I can see, he's emotional and when he feels seated or done wrong, he reacts exactly  I always react violently verbal with crowds. and he just goes on pure management. Well, it must be that it was me and in ways it still is when I get my feelings hurt. I don't always say, you really hurt my feelings. You say, you mother and  what I do. What I've done for a lot of years is I would hurt myself because someone hurt me. Well, it means it does that, it's practice. I�� YOC – Don't I? Ma' sister! Thank you, you take it right all the time. You go! You always keep that or all bring in the tent, just you are no more, just up. I'm not for all that man. Bobby Pau's is Benjamin Minnick. and throws the ball up and pracks it to the out to. Bring your whole fellow, bring your whole. A few minutes later, the engine finally does a lap. What do you want? Walk the whole! You still got him, good throw now, mom. When he was these kids ages, Bobby ran wild at night, taking money, stealing bikes. Most kids were afraid of him, but he never messed with meaning my brothers. I even remember Bobby and his sister eating his couple times. because his mom never made dinner. When Bobby was 13 his mother caught him stealing chained out of her purse and kicked him out of the house. The only place Bobby knew to go was right here to this field, if he now coaches his mom. He used to be in a band and lot, full of old cars and refrigerators. Here in the left out here, the joys pacing and muttering because Bobby told him to put looking for a fight. Right here, he used to be a white swift and uhhh. Little sifter. That's where Bobby went on his mother soon now. That's great painting all the windows black. So no one could proceed. And I would shop live, move from the corner store, the Matty's. That would be testing neighborhood, stuff  me and the sausages and bottle of wine that go to sleep with the night and sorry, that was dead. Bobby says that alcohol helps me feel less afraid late at night in that old fort. Soon he found part. PCP. In his 20s he started shooting now. He's so beautiful. He's so beautiful. He's so beautiful. Trash is talk at every practice. And Bobby is sees the wants. But wearing pay less shoes, which a kid would never be perfect. Brandon the 80 or almost Bobby powdered donor because his wife. He likes the land in the Bobby and whisper. Bobby laughs. Other times though, especially when the kids start in on each other, you can get them. Bell it. Bell it. Bell it. I can't talk if you talk. I'm not ready to put your gloves in the bag and go home. Give me this stuff, let me go. Oh, hey, no man. I'm sure it will shut up. Everybody shut up, please. Bobby picks up the bat bag and slams it against the brick wall. See you. OK. See you. I can't talk with y'all, huh? What's up fellas, what's happening? Somewhere around the third or fourth practice, about announcing it in the way. Voice start calling body coats. Coach, can you fix this glove? Coach, which batch you're at use? What's the life in this whole coat? , I had no... It didn't really hit me at first. , I took them to a picnic a couple of weeks ago. We can still get recovering off of all of the national transfer and to hear people there, hey Bob, you look Bobbi, there's been the hear of these kids that I came with. Hey coach, take coach, that's what has sort of hit me there, hey man,  that's what you are. And in these people now see me as coach. not just Bobby, he's recovering. But don't feed, , and he's coached. So that makes me feel good to have these kids come and coached. So I don't know now. Now I have this  little small part in shaping what they're, what they're days from the life of . I don't know. I don't know. after you just never want them to keep you  so close your mouth and then get over it. But I learned understand how do you understand it? You don't want to trouble me this one as a listen. But you want me to do it. I'll get it. and you are wrong. Here's the people who stop their invocation. I just roll it and roll. I thought they were more patient. And I think that's what happened. The Department of Recreation gives Bobby an ID box, which he wears around his neck way comes down to the neighborhood. a sign. And no longer don't seem I'm doing something to you. Most people might keep it in the past. Bobby wears it right on his chest. So that's exactly it. So you're the one. So your fan justocar Papa little dirty with Nancy right now. to walk around with my head high and feel them proud. It was the most part very proud of what I'm doing. Disceptics are everywhere though. Neighbors who gave him new dances for King Jocelyn and the Duke. People who stole bank cards from people he actually stood on. What's that  to you to walk around and enable it and you might even walk by somebody that you too many to work hard money out. It's a roller coaster, , there's times. And right when I'm feeling  the world is wonderful, everything going my way. See someone did I, it kind out of a few hundred bucks. And the... voice in my head will immediately say, see there? You're listening to my bag. Remember what? Look, that's where you really are. What do you think when you see the office? It depends. It depends on how I feel. And there's times when I might be feeling real is steering off, put that much of thing up and put cotton thing up. And hope they say something wrong and you can go south with the people. So... I mean there's a part of me that still wants to be stuck, ? This a part of me still very capable of being stuck, ? I just wouldn't be able to be a real good talk with my hands, and I'm older, I have to get a weapon, ? I wear no guns. It's earlyening, and I'm... to the new forms of local recommendations. This is the first new thing they've seen all season. Bats and gloves are splintered and old, but the uniforms are bright, blue and gray, Texas Ranger uniforms, red caps. Bobby is tan and relax, dancing around, bacon jabs, counting the kids to see if he can feel the team. Never shorts him. Today, they're exactly learn boards. The day they're first seen, then they're ready to see the team. They're ready to see the team. They're ready to see the team. They're ready to see the team. They're ready to see the team. another team. The recreation buses now are late to take a team to begin. So some of us go on a taxi. Six kids and I all squish the button. Bobbie and the others are healing tab when bus finally shows up. We all pile out at what is supposedly the best little leafy of the city. The grass is shin high, there's a pile of dirt in the outfield. No fans, no fears, just Bobbie and the team. That means they have a feel on the snow. It was on it. Six, five, six. There you go. You did it. Hold it. Hold it. I'm a safe little thing. The other team never shows. So Bobby's team wins by default. Some other kids are in the same boat, so there's an impromptu sprint. And the official or not, this is the first baseball game that most of these kids have ever played. This is a good small man. We would set it up. Okay, we'll set it up. Okay, we'll set it up. The other team is small but very fast. And they have three coaches who tell them when to steal bowls. So a line drag becomes a run. Then another run. And another in the Spies Zero. We've got all of our y'all. We've got two sign-on. So I will see what we need to work on today. Instead of looking good in our uniform. Come on, let's get out, we got four to set. The season lurch is forward with DC recreation canceling games for no reason. Never we schedule new games. The unicorns are not lost for three weeks, and one day no one shows up to what the boys industry that are doing so they're happy. By June Bobbis team is only played one new old game, one day new formats. In the same consist of a little Bobbis someone that kids can count on. Never miss. I mean, in his penis, most days to hit the ball to ball. And while it might seem  body speaking with kids and mind, he'll tell you that's what they're doing for him. I don't want to have to avoid my neighbor, I don't want to have to avoid my community's playground because I let these kids down because I'm a drunken, dope, dumb, which is what I've become. If I go up here right now, tomorrow I'm a bomb, because all the good feelings are gone. I don't want to feel ashamed which I felt from relapses. And let's speak our shame. Be ashamed. I won't be able to look these kids in their eyes in their faces. I hope that they'll be done. I'm 42 years old and I would have come to my own neighborhood and done children because I'm ashamed. I don't want to. Don't ask smoke, don't ask smoke, don't ask smoke. Yeah. You're mad out there, you're mad. By June Bobby's team gets it's first one. This is great pitching from Donald. And it's half a mile apart on the third inning. That looks more  a football industry. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yeah, oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't make it, I'm not. I want to wait for the bus to take them back home. The boys start tussling each other rolling around on a grassy hill. Hey, you're in jail. This is celebrating their win. Yeah, I said, wait, no, we're wrestling. I'm about to mess up. This is easily the sweetest moment of the season. Not only because of a win, but because it's amazing to see the boys so happy. And this is what Bob and William and when Justin and Ricardo get in a real fire and we'll be up right now. later when he asked his husband Benjamin not once but twice when Joey threatens to feel a petite from the movie team. Always that delicate now it's fragile and surprised. Oh, I thought I was going to be an loser forever. And first of all, being clean makes me feel  okay, God changed me when it was because is simply impossible and some of them. It's, . . This is something I never thought. And if that I be able to do. It's , Yeah, how is walk after a practice  a week or two ago? I swear to God, I walk across the ground. It's just a way in our starting line. I start crying because I'm so happy. , so happy. That man's probably going to work out. I'm probably going to be able to pull this off. I'm the end of the season the kids have a record of two games and no losses. Playoffs never get scheduled, so there's no reason to practice. No one knows where Benjamin is these dudes, and just this week I saw Joey's doing the soda from the corner store, and I made him take it back. Bobby still comes around though, and hangs out in the pot, talks with the boys. Sometimes she's one on one with him. And he says stick this me. I'm gonna have tryouts for 12 and under basketball team. I'm gonna still be coming around to you Hey, Davis and Washington, DC At poor what police cannot do The clues at a crime scene are not always conclusive, of course. Let's crimes of forever and soul die touched why, stuck to the years and never found again, but we wanted to do. We had our program today with this crime scene story, and right at any bender, red dress by Matt McCoy. Once there was an orphan who had a knack from finding lost things, both as parents had been killed when they'd years old. They were swimming in the ocean when it turned wild with waves and each and tried to save the other from drowning. And boy woke up from a nap on the sand, alone. After the tragedy, the community adopted and raised him a few years after the death of his parents. It began to have a sense of objects even when they weren't visible. The stability continued growing in power through his team, in my eyes, 20, who was able to actually sniff out lost sunglasses, keys, contact line-views and swunners. The neighbors discovered his palinance panel. He was over again, he showed us how swan even picking it up. day when Jenny's mother mispressed her hairbrushes walking around and playing about this. The young man's nose twitched and returned slightly towards the kitchen, pointed to the drawer where the spoons and knives were kept. His date burst into laughter. Now that would be quite a civil-faced to put the brush she said, among all that silver. And she opened the drawer to make her corn, to waved with a knife or a brush her hair with the spoon, but when she did, boom, there was the hairbrush. with great girls sitting on top of the floor. Jenny's mother kissed the young man on the cheek, but Jenny herself looked at him suspiciously all night long. He planned all that into, she said, over dinner. He would try to impress my mother, but you didn't impress me, she said. He tried to explain himself, but she would hear none of it, and when he drove his car up to her house, she fled before it even finished staying at a nice time, which was a lie. He went home to his tiny room and thought about the word lonely and how it sounded and looked so long. And those two elves in it, each standing tall by itself. As news spread around the neighborhood about the young man's skills, people reacted in two ways. They were the deeply appreciative and the skeptics. The appreciative ones called up the young man Regume, need stop-by and his way to school find your keys and give them home with nothing. The skeptics called them over too, and watched him  a hawk. He'd still find the lost items, and they'd insist it was in elaborate scams, and was doing it all in get attention. Maybe, there'd one woman, they'd learn to exfangirl in the air, maybe, she said. He steals the things, so he think it's lost. And moves the item, and then comes over to save him. How do we know it was really lost in the first place? What is going on? viel know himself, all he knows is feeling in tug and light but in system. a child, the sea. In that tug would turn in the right direction and show him where he looked. Each object had its own way of inhabiting space in therefore messaging and location . The young man could sense, could smell, not his presence. He did not need the sea, the sea over, could its gravity now. As would be expected. items that turned out to be miles away to much harder concentration in the ones that were too steeped in the lap. When Mrs. Allen's little board didn't come home one after that was the most difficult ball. Leonard Allen was eight years old and usually arrived home from school with 305. An allergy needed a pill before we went back out to play. That day, by speed. 45 alone Mrs. Allen was a wreck. Her boy railing got lost, only once that that happened in the supermarket, but even found quite easily under the code of St. Louis. Cline. The walk home from school was a straight line, and Leonard was not the one from Cline. Mrs. Allen was just a regular neighbor, except for one spurdener in fact. Fulden in Heridence, she was the owner of a gun-manchewing ambulance and called the rain star. It sat, glass-cased in a kitchen where everyone can see it from the shun and sister that it is seen. Sometimes, as a party trip, she'd even cut steak with its devil-edge. On this day, she took the green star out of its case and stuck her palms on. Where is my boy, she cried. The green star was cold and flat. She ran weeping to her neighbor who calming walked her back home, together the gave the house and set her up. and the neighbor of the neighbor, recommended call on the one home. Although Mrs. Allen's a skeptic, she thought anything was worthwhile idea, and when Paul answered, she said, in a trum once. You must find my book, the young man who can just about to go play basketball in his friends. He'd locate a basketball on the bathtub. You lost him? So do he. Mrs. Allen, the Andrew explain, and the phone clicked. One moment, Mrs. Allen. said, and the other men held on. When a voice returned, it was shaking the rage. He's been kidnapped, she said. They want the green star. The other man realized then, his missing balance was talking for him or not. Oh, he said, I see. Everyone in the towns familiar with his balance green star. I'll be right over, missing. The woman voice was too rounded, fears to his arm. His basketball shorts and shirt. the young man jarged over him's avalanche House. Who was amazed at how the green stars all in the sound of the small, shaded green. He had a desire to look at him. By then Mrs. Allen was in hysterics. They didn't tell me what to do, she sobbed. Where do I bring my ammo? How do I get my boy back? The young man tried to feel the scent of the boy. He asked for a photograph and stared at. a brown-heared kid at his convenience house in graduation. But the young man had only found objects before and lost objects at that. He never found anything, and anybody stole him. He wasn't a policeman. This is Alan Calbucleus, and then officer showed up in the door. Oh, it's the finding guy, , so say. The young man did his head modestly. He turned to his right. He's left. No one. He got a glimmer of a feeling towards the north and walked up the back door through the backyard. Night approached, and the sky seemed to grow and deepen in darkness. What's his name again? He called back and this is down. Leonard, she said. He heard the police mingle out of the pan and began to ask basic questions. He couldn't quite feel him. He felt the air. tug inside the green star, and object displaced from the original home, and the region. He felt the tug of a tree in the front yard which had been uploaded from Virginia to the green, and in the rear. He felt the tug of his own watch for some of his own common. And in attempt to be fond of his own golden sister who take it, and they go through the gestures false. Maybe the door was too far away, I know. He heard the police minass. What? What is he wearing? This is Alan described to Blue shirt and young man focused in on the movement. He turned off his distractions and Blue shirt came calm in one class and got distant radio station. The young man went walking and walking and about 14 houses down he felt Blue shirt shrieking at him. And he walked right into the back yard right with the back yard and he sure enough there were four people watching the game. including the tear-stained boy with the funny nose eating candy bar. The young man scooped up the boy while the others watched so surprised and did nothing. And one even murdered. Saw him yet. For 14 houses back, the young man held Leonard and Zoms and cried. Leonard stops kneeling. looked up at the stars and the young man smelled under tear, rich with memories being apart. He hoped Leonard would ask him a question, any questions, but Leonard was quiet. The young man answered him and said, son, he's eaten himself, and the word rolled around and Markle on a marble floor. Son, you wanted to sing. When he reached Mrs. Allen's door which was wide open, he walked in with quiet manner and Mrs. Allen, comfortable burst into tears and increased him slunked after door. She thanked the young man thousand times, even offered in the green star between the trees. Leonard turned on the TV and drove up on the sofa. The young man. walked over and asked him about the program as much as he learned stuff as diamonds mouth and didn't respond. Feel better, he said something. Talking the basketball beneath his arm and then walked home, shoulders low. In his tiny room he undressed and laying dead. Had it been a naked child with nothing on, no shoes, no neck and snowed hair but no wash. You cannot have found me. He lay in bed that night with the trees from other prices, rustling, and the feel and their confusion. , snow here. It's not lovely. Her and my own. It is wrong with this dirt. Crossing his hands and front of him, he held onto his shoulders. Come some shade hard and you cannot. Where are you? And we can't blank and quiet. We couldn't see him at her. He squeezed his eyes shut and left the question bubble up. Where did you go? Come sign me, I'm over here, come find me. If he listened hard enough, he's gone. we could hear the waves singing.
