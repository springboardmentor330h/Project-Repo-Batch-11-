I want to wear it tomorrow. You're going to go watch in the shirt And it's not that with me You That's delicious thinks that's the wish he is. She's , , he's a boy. , , first of all, he can't cook him for himself. He's a boy. What he can do is because he's a boy. The woman's mom always has this little saying that really, I know she goes sometimes when the house is dirty, she says, oh, it looks  there's never been women in the house. Making a sound , , women are sick. Clean up,  what? They're asking, , , there's no one, , he's supposed to mean a garage, fixing the car or something. It's a typical American story in this country. In the time she was little, Sylvia spoke English better than her parents. She was one of the family who'd called the phone company or the utilities. She translated teacher conferences. The family was going somewhere in needed directions, Sylvia was the one who'd walk up to a stranger and ask for them. And now, nearly grown up, she wants to be an American girl in a way that her parents don't completely understand. She goes through a big integrated public school. Few years ago, she started listening. into the cranberries in your vana and the tala from. About the kind of stuff of parents' name, growing up in small towns in rural Mexico. My mom wants me to be a typical Mexican girl. When I was younger, before I had my could tell, I used to  start, I used to start , , alternative music in my mom and my mom. It means  the coming out party. It's a team, yeah. It's a turn 15. Yeah, a huge party, they make , they just, , get your own beautiful dress. His palms give him a break, long and spectacular, memorable music for our world. And , these, I used to start liking alternate music around the age of 14 around the time to start liking my talent and my remember my cousins used to say that, oh, as soon as you hit your kid, , , you can start liking Mexican music and working to start taking your out because in my family, as soon as you hit 15, you're allowed to go to Mexican dances, but usually go with your older cousins and that's my mom wanted me to be  a,  my cousins, they own. to Mexican dancers, they have Mexican boys friends. I mean she wanted me to dress them, she didn't want me to dress kind of alternate. And now I tell my mom, she's sometimes began to fight in my team alone, I'm , I'm not  my cousins. I'm  my cousins are really  1918 and they're already pregnant. Amari, I'm , is that what you want me to do as my wife? This weekend, this is a particularly urgent question in the Sylvia's life. This weekend, January 31st, 1998, Sylvia turns 18. She's legally recognized as an adult, capable of deciding for herself what she's doing in life. And she and her mom have been talking about what she's going to do. Sylvia wants to go to a four-year college, wait to get married, wait to have kids. And her mom's trying to understand. Sometimes she's kind of , , yeah, I do what you're more, , do what you're actually doing. and there's just times where , why do you want to do that? Why do you want to do that? Why do you think you're better than me? But why do you think you're special? I'm , man, I don't think I'm special. I just want to do something with my feet. When I'm a young, back at Tomabikas, my mom went to go to school. She was a very good school nearby, but a grandfather told her now. She said the only reason to grow as good school is to get boyfriends. So she stopped on and it's great. And that's just been most of her time at home, raising some of these brothers and sisters taking care of the house, rarely we've eaten the house. My mom has lived in a box all alone, and I feel  the love of Rick's people here. And , 11 of the box, you raise your shirt and you box. And sometimes I'll just , , try to climb up. She's  pushing me in or trying to poke a hole in the box and she keeps it right back off. I assume it's got three freaking tiny toys, and they're so mysterious here. He's skating the bucks you were going into. From WB EZ Chicago, in public area international, it's this American life from our glass. Each of the course which is a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program in 3X,  one, American Girl turns 18, back to, 33 million dollar box, true story of a successful Cincinnati businessman, who escaped his old life and created a new one in one single day by robbing bank. Factory, the feeling... wanting to be feeling you get, you have an excerpt from David Chaos Funny and thrilling story of a middle-aged woman who escapes the box of brown-wonged students. Heck one, American Girl Turns 18. So, so if you're living at home, see your in high school, engaged in an ongoing discussion between mom about what she should be after graduation in four months. And why the sugar of a life  her mom is? She's just scared to get out of the box. She even told me she just scared. I mean if she has to go to my grandmother's house, I just didn't do a stick one bus if you look all straight. And she just , yes, I'll have a certain stop and walk a lot, walk a lot to it. And my mom, let's get her to her mother. She's back herself. Let's get her to hell out of her, be in my herself. It's just really scary. And I'm always about this. And I'm always doing a fix and band us up in the most. I think something she admire is me that I'm not scared, but at the same time she just stood in me. Looks  she admire me that I'm not scared by the time she hates me because she's not scared. Subscribe to the box of cheese. I want guests, it's just  the typical Mexican family where you're married and have children and you die together in the childhood. What's the while back to your homeland and you have your Mexican music and laughs and laughter and drinking and party and all the cousins come together and all the gay and sons come together. that sounds  a bitch. Yeah, I can be nice but I mean when you're... only hang around with that kind of people and that's where people and they're, , just might, they're kind of also, , , , they get something, but they're also really, kind of  the way she thinks. Everybody thinks the same way and everybody thinks the same. And they're not too crazy, but people think different. Yeah, it's kind of , I'm the outcast of the family, I'm  the black sheep. And that's why I really never did tune it up. I really never had a moon I wanted them. And also, , I never really asked for anything. , I never really wanted anything really from them. And now that I'm just going to turn 18, they notice I really don't ask me from them. I remember one, totally specific. It happened. Master, just pop them to my head. I remember that my grandparents come in some, and all that uncles and me and come to the house. My grandparents had their own stuff  that. And I was working and when I came home one of my aunts came and she's kind of  really, she's  the oldest, the second oldest of them I find really bitter. , she's my aunt and I love them stuff  that, but she's really bitter. And she had told my mom, really got me. This woman, who? I talked to maybe once or twice a year because my mom was raised by this aunt almost that's  she sees her as a mother figure too. She has a lot of respect for her. She told my mom that the day that I grew up I'm gonna be ashamed of my parents especially of her because she has no education and because she's an immigrant of this country. And that's the number of how dare she's saying that? I think I'll vomit. Does she want me to become  her kids? Her oldest daughter got pregnant 16. And her youngest son is kind of , , a director. He really doesn't know what he does. And I'm , this woman has the idea that I'm going to be of seeing the my mom because I'm going to have an education and because I'm going to have a career. I suggest to Sylvia that a parent's met in the STEM situation that it makes which is, after all, they themselves escape the box that you own and revives, how pretty to themselves enroll in a Mexican or a city Chicago to a country where they need to speak the language. Sylvia doesn't buy it. But as we talk, one of the most striking things is how they're still a part of her, the biggest part of her. They want to parents to see the understanding. And that's it. she sees her in line. She still wants to be put in the pen. That's  this. Sometimes you use the cement mine. It's my mom and my god,  they're talking. This stuff I get into, go for an hour. You see, , you see another sister in all. She's a mother. She's , usually I see my little sister in my own. So my dad, talking, saying, ah, sometimes you see my mom. more sister. No,  this  that and I'm usually no in another room to be my long friend usually. I usually never do anything  that. And you feel  that's missing your chance and that's  you may. Sometimes I do because a lot of things that they want me to do, I don't want to do and it really hurts me. That's no, that they're not really supportive. So I guess I just tried to, , boom my stuff away from me so they will put me in this box. But they don't understand that. They think I'm too strong to be hurt. I'm not right. No. You're getting out of the boxes in the swimming room. And they're planning to be still more in the run. That's real good. in a box and get out and change all the time. Let us listen. Yes. Here people, here we happy in the box, you have a box. How you feel, , right here? Do you have a sense of what kind of thing you can do? I have an idea, I want this job because I want to do digital, not special, digital, fact-send. the movie's in the studio. Yeah,  Jurassic Park and then it's , it's the right time. I think it's so cool. And I just want , what do you want to do? I just , I just , I think it's  sitting there. I'm not  an office to myself, but usually I can open space, but a lot of different equipment everywhere and having  a, , sitting in front of the computer and doing all these things on the computer and the making and getting really frustrated because it takes me  six months to do  a five-second little scene and it's just  doing my own thing and I have to get dressed up, go casual, have a look and I have a ring or something on, have my hair or whatever color I want, have a little cool part of us, , it's just a dream. Have you seen as the sponsors in today with the show I could be? and I make these special facts and you see the people and what they look  to do all that work. Yeah, I see them making a lot of drastic part. I can't say 10, , the space cheer. And that's what I want to do. I'll just use my imagination to make this thing blow up or something. Which would be the spear and trying to get a bit. That's my biggest fear is failing. that because I don't  so many things I don't so realization that doesn't mean clubs, they're artists, classes and all these grades and it's just gonna go to waste, that's what big the spirit that's gonna go to waste it. Whatever I did, it's gonna mark you knock me. And if you found what would the bubble of the tea, what would the bubble of the tea, what would the bubble of the... What would be my favorite? What would happen to you? Yeah. I'll become  working the $11 on the job. Let us know. 25 with the ready two chairs and a husband and just doing that day by day doing the same thing over and over I'm what could make it more Oh, or something   my ambitions can tie out It's  , it's kind of   you rebel against everybody because thinking of what you're doing You think you want to  you want to achieve more more and do more But every time you do you take another step it just  hits you right in the face  how how how you can't do it go back into your mind And it's  it not tired after why you just get really tired of  the cause and of the doors and telling you no you can't do this for you. You  a maybe need to arm right. You just get one day I'll just get tired and I'll just say you went. And if you don't get out by the time you're 22 or 28 and you're getting great it's probably that's a lot of time. I just knew you didn't understand. Yeah unless I change or something else, I'll send something happen to my personal support of that. I don't get it. I just want you to go on  I'm actually, , , want her on the house or something, , then I feel  , I'm happy  I'm actually happy to be whole.

Don't marry some kind of Tory. So if you turn 18 this weekend, happy birthday. Good luck. When you move through the sky, hold your hand above me. And the door. of the dark. At the end of the dark, there is a cold hot rain. Have a sweet and ganzen Seattle snow sit. I will not let go of my hands Walk on through the winds Walk on through the waves I will not let go of my hands And... And... And... And... And... Back to... , it's been a hard week for it. It's been a hard week for... And in fact, you could reasonably argue. It didn't history of interns. This past week or two. In the January 1998. They have been the boat point. In intern, here at WB EZ Chicago, And home of this American line. How many of this was waiting for the Ultra in the suite? Did she stand there in this guy's strax at the conversation? And they're talking about this in that. And he says for it some point. So what do you do? And she doesn't look, she's an intern. This is a really. As if she just told him, My job? On the slide. That's my job. Our senior editor Paul Top was once an intern. I started in public radio as an intern. The National Public Radio in Washington 19 years ago. In fact, I would not have escaped the box that I grew up in. If not in that internship. I would not be in radio at all. We had this American , are he staff? A former intern's, producers of least speaking, Nancy Update, Julie Snyder, all former interns. And so, just  a small book, for the dignity of interns everywhere. In this dire dire. hour. Around this American life and capable and serious minded Rachel Day will introduce our next actor in the program welcome to the show Rachel. Thanks, Lara. Okay, ready to do this. I think so. All right. Here's a piece of the radio show. Try safe. Bring it back on me one piece. I think we're ready to go back to $33 million box. Very Miller didn't have the kind of light to think he wanted to skip. He owned a clothing store and since now they were. was worth 30 $ million. He could buy whatever he wanted. Took $15,000 vacation to this family. But he was unhappy. And one day he permanently escaped his own life and introduced anyone with one simple and an orthodox app. He robbed the bank. Alex Bloomberg taught me that the hockey correction of the city and now symbol. If you asked very much what was wrong with me from lots of money, I'll tell you this. He used to go to Rome at least twice a year. Thank you never subject. He never went to the Vatican. If his business was open the morning, he'd find a flight back and after me. He was driven. His relationship with his family suffered. In Dallas once I listened to what my older son, my little child, and I, there we spent a lot of time with him. I would try to get a softer game, so those kinds of things, but I never really needed on time. I was , no, I got there if he's asked for it. We were out, we were driving around and here I am with my son and I have so very little to talk to them. So little that I can relate with him about we started talking about cars and so I thought, well it was interesting cars, let's go buy a car. So I went to buy a car, we bought a car, didn't we? I can't afford to buy a car, we went to buy a car. Looking back, he says he was shallow and vain. He says he was worshiping post-cards. At the time though, he only felt a big nagging that something wasn't right. But he says gradually that blueam became more insistent and to extreme reforms. For instance, he says, he started blacking out, losing hours in the day. I was in the middle of convism, and I lost enough to me. I didn't really know where I was when I was doing. I ended up finding myself sitting in a lounge in a building that I recalled on the engine because I had some business to do there but it was three hours later. I don't know what I did but it was three hours later. Sometimes you actually make a real decision to change your life and you set about to me. But just this often you find yourself sort of edging toward the new life, half consciously. But we occupy people's doors and neighbours, taking us everywhere, way to can figure it out culturally when people are working with us. And Sam's family reports that I'm safe in the area around just something  a little thing I've just shared about the things that I learned in my life. Well another part, secretly pots and ambush. Very Miller's case is as extreme as you can get. When he describes what happened, it's  he's describing a person in a trans. The day before the beg robbery, I drove by a client at this, and I stopped, and I didn't do a part. And I have two cars. One I used, and one my wife, and I read it at the phone. I really don't know what. I went to the car, but I went to the car and I continued on my way home and they were called that the Ratafax paper and I drive by the Sam's which is where we used to get our facts paper from. Sam's is on the right side of the road on the left side of the road is a keymark. So I'm headed towards Sam's to get the patch paper and I turn into the keymark buttons over to Sam's. and I bought a steamer and this is September so they're not really out for sale. And I had steamers at home. I bought a steamer and I bought a steamer because at some point in time I come to see the car and here I have a package with a steamer and see. a number of cars you put I know I bought it. Next day I get up and put into my briefcase of gun and basketball. We've rested bit. I got this gun on June 16th. I've made you find that with a bit of 15 months before. I used it. I bought the gun because I was from Commitsoosa. I had taken the gun. We had about cleaning on this condo. I took the gun one night and I shot it into the woods. I had never shot it gun in my life. I'm going to know how it felt because I figured the footage might hit a lot of nowhere to put it. 15 months later I get the gun. put it in my briefcase, I leave. And from there, I don't really remember exactly what happened. I don't know how I got to the bank. I don't know how I picked that bank or that mutation. I don't recall specific instances. Once right, I declare I am not an alien. I promising thiscking is myself to be an alien. And I gave up on this... this first and second curse, she said if the trial that I said something did we all of the money or a typical what you see in movies. I don't really remember she said give money. She hadn't given me all of the money and I said all of it or something  that. what I remember is anything that she said in the trial. When he robbed the bank he was earning well into six figures in here. He's taking the library. It doesn't know. It's a lack of swallow, rub a bang, then claim not to remember it, especially when we put a steam mask and rented a car made before. And it's possible that we need the story about not moving, when we want to try it. We put innocent by reason and sanity, which I didn't buy it. I talked to Steve Tolbert, the prosecutor in the most criminal trial. He says it's possible that no one was in a kind of a hazem. Robin Bank. He'd certainly never heard that defense before. But for Tolbert, it was a material. Either way, Milley was good to have the pot. But even Tolbert questions why I made her who could have gotten the substantial loan from any bank in the city would actually need to hold one up in money. And more importantly, why would he have fungled the job so badly? When Milley lays out the facts, it's hard to believe this work to work on how it's super achiever. was really trying to get away with. Again, if this was a robbery to really get some money, I got to think I was selected in place that wasn't on a busy street, a busy corner where the police station took lots of money, but in any event my most vivid memories are after the bank robbery. We're here on your hand, walking down the street that's relatively busy to parking much of the bank where I parked my car is in the back and we haven't even parked in front. I had a walk a quarter of a block to get some car. And I'm walking with a gun in my hand and the master of my face, but every time I was in the morning, that was in Halloween. The police came relatively quickly. The bag that had the money in it, the dry thing exploded, and I was a big cop with a gun in the yelling. that week, I'll get down on the ground, , get down on the ground and I really didn't totally comprehend all of what he was saying, but I eventually didn't. And I got there every morning, I did hand up and put me into this bar and took me away. I know longer a rich man. I'm no longer a society person, I know longer. Without Eveningaces, he's a the person that I was before I killed at Pursy. I can create this person that I want to be. I can create the person who has more compassion and person who wants a different life, and every wants to live a different way. I live in the team that I live in, and I live in the world. I live in the world. I live in the world. position, how many for my surgery been in a bathroom? There's not do what I did. You don't go in the bathroom. So therefore I have now been a cast out for my film. That which they made it from me, I guess I can't give to them. That which I was supposed to be on now in Paris, which is rather remarkable because frankly I now am happy I'll be with myself as a consumer. was doing well with that team. This is maybe the hardest thing of all to swallow. Talking to Miller, I got up in the middle of the evening. He sounded  a new convert to a religion or a junkie who's gone clean. someone desperate to believe what he is saying is true. And who can blame him? When Barry Miller gets out of jail in four years, he's going to have to rebuild the light from scratch. We'll family, no job, 68 years old. Despite my doubts, I want to be able to do it. That's Blumberg is a writer and she's hard out. So Rachel, one takes to the ad-lib right? Yeah, coming up. Listen, it's our service and all of our great international. That's a minute and I'm gonna be doing this. Now Bennett. It's this American life. I'm Rachel Day. The intern here at this American life. Each week of course we choose a theme invited a variety of writers and performers to take a walk at that theme. Today's show is escaping the box of your own life. We've arrived at Act 3. If you need one and if you need it. Rachel, that was such a good job. Good. You are a credit to income revenue. I am so glad in this third office now. Well, in this Act we have a stroke and David Cal. that premiered here at the Goodman Theatre here in Chicago. In this show David Kelkins out on stage in Black James and Porto Rysherd. Without dressing as a woman or changing as a person in white, he simply becomes his middle age, good humored, greenish woman named Lily. The story he tells us of how Lily escapes the life she's in, she launches herself out of her old life in this kind of half-trans,  the bank library we heard from earlier, but not quite Lily and takes steps to destroy her own life, possibly some of you can. have conscious that that's exactly what it is that she's trying to do. And the incident that gets her out of her all blood turns out to be so small and awkward and a bit disappointing, but it does the job. Before we begin this story, a quick warning that there's some sexual content in this story. No nasty words and there's nothing as graphic as the network news this week. So, but some mild sexual content that may not be appropriate for some interesting. The thought of someone else inside you is something. I never can do tons of things. Keith had said to me before he went out north of that job. I could get over something he said. Or can't we? But if someone else went inside, I don't think I could ever touch you again. Don't be dramatic, guys. Maybe he's going anywhere with me. Then almost a minute to do our shot. Keith was hardly this precious bulb. It would be just in my pocket. 15 years by a student, with a look on his face, the country is shivering up in the bottom of the ocean. Why have that dirty look of your face, Jimmy, for when I said, and stop trying to put your fingers in my mouth. I'm a married woman. It was  my husband just flew out of the room that was. Jimmy was really hot in mind for love before I said yes. to kill you. He was the kind of person I always want, but I was his age. He never seen interested in me. He wasn't generally a journalist. Jimmy's then generally tight notice of women  me. He seemed to talk to me. Jimmy was , wow. Rough-fronted ages, he was a bit of a death. Didn't give things a lot of thought, why he did. He was fun. Okay, that's it. I think that she's a human. Actually, she was only a person I knew, but didn't find me if I knew anything. I can't believe that little chick is sick. Oh, I really appreciate her, but... And to be a spouse, find me again. It was really the idea of a Jimmy coming along the kid, completely being over to the case. I've been holding out, so I thought to the Jimmy follow-up. So when the aim of desire came on so strong that day, something in me was saying it would not be a good idea to turn to me. It'll be a little sling. We have to work out this cheap thing. Lillian, it's between you and yourself. Jimmy New Keith is happy to be watching the precious bulb of civilster, a friend. See you in the next video. which we have to see his existence. These are the same. Yes. This is the same. Have to see the rest. Much. He tried his car  he just rubbed the bank. We ran red light. How long did he see the lion off the wall? His car didn't have saved the bones. I cut them off. They were uncomfortable. I cut them off. because he's going to start the engine as soon as I'm a stacked-in. Jimmy's house was lined with tiny aquariums. He got all the time, he told him what their existence was, what their came from. He was  your son, right? Outside the store, he looked much. He looked a little nice, what do we do? When the baby is new from here, fools happen, look at the dead. even the lizard scuttled behind their plastic rocks. I needed it, I felt  I had been thrown into a wrestling ring. As we were rolling around on his legged blanket, I must have been storks. Am I really doing this? It was so rough and young, there was no warming up with Jimmy. That much mass of prize, it was dreadful. It's funny, I've been as I got used to kids, man. Jimmy had a small man. I think he's tongue was right at him. He was not insensitive about Jesus tongue. He just sort of ficturated my mouth. But the tongue is one of those lizards of his. What ever was wrong with Keith? The sexual part of my heart. I might be able to write it, leave us consent. In sexually speaking, I'd say Keith was  a really good bunch. in a pretty good restaurant. Very good service without a little disappointing. Jimmy seems to approach the whole thing I give some form of truth. Well it's time for something needed to be over friend but really I was just looking. He was nervous. I tried to risant sling, LinkedInists, and my supposed to sense him. Then he breathed into my ear and I f**ked you. But the thoughts that I was going to sign were to do to him. I'm not really going to be able to be the final straw. I'm not a sadist. If you are. What follows is a brief scene that's too graphic to play for you in the radio, let's say, thanks take a while to make a precise French shot really into its opening. There's a thinking about it as me, staring into it. Can I have a little piece of this list? Can you really have any business? Just  above the heads and all. It is starting to feel a little bit  a bit of a dentist smaller sexual hell. Then Jimmy makes a noise  he's been shot in the leg. I realize thank God. He rolls there if you have a side of the blanket. That was sexy. Yes, I was wrong. But they jimmed some big sweltering enemies. He ran a bath, put something blue, golden, showed me his muscles. Ooh, that's it. Electained those. He's quiet, he's not drunk. And he was a boy with it. I have expect to please help me. He was behind, he did not do something wrong. No, of course not. For my grandson, Bob, was my home, right? He said, Bob, he was behind, he did my back. Through all dreams of my shoulders and his strength. It's a giraffe. No, it's a crying. He looks even younger, he's looking at his head. And I'm thinking of Keith in his Volvo, the talent's working on with his radio and the stocking on. Who would that be? Actually I'm just looking to sponsor the image of his father. And I'm thinking of his father. He's looking at his head. And it's not that little stress would go away. That breath will not. And it's not that soft. It's not that soft. It's not that soft. Now let's get ahead five years. Really in this out of an orange. What in the book is this? So it says to go away to Brighton. Now let's get ahead five years. Really in this out of an orange. What in the book is this? So it says to go away to Brighton. But I was walking along the front, past the shalais on the bridge when I saw the Codinai then. I turned around and said, this young man, the kid. He was a young man. He presumably must be accustomed to this dog. It's me, said man, the kid, it's Jimmy. Don't you remember? Jimmy had cried. You look slightly different, I'm gonna walk by. has to, besides that it's much seen. But it's probably my imagination, I think. What are you doing here, I have, I live here. Since when since now four years ago, not gonna be different. I don't fight anymore, this. I do touch. Just love, don't mess with anymore, and I can't beat you. Yeah my wife says it gives me a third. What? Can you believe it is? I got it. It's my design. You shouldn't give me some problem. I'm blind. I'm not a man. He asked me if I'd  to grab a bag. So, to say, I was a man who'd come up with this. What do you think I should do now? I don't drink coffee myself. Only her tea. I'm watching my health. But I have a chamomile tea in top of the stove. I'm very strict. I'm too serious. I should be having a glass of wine. I'm going to have a tea. I'm the cigarette. And that order helped me. Enough. Good night, God's didn't use it too. One of the most good night glasses I've ever seen. That beautiful girl, that's the most beautiful. He looks to power and to say, the bargain with himself. That's the most beautiful. But he had a lot of attitude. That's what I've seen. He wanted me to be his wife, thought the tubers would get a lot. She reminds me of you, she's been older, very successful in business, has her own company. She claims executives had a speaking public now to alter their image so they became more effective tool in the marketing box. The whole edge of our sad post, three. I asked him what his role in all this was in city video 10 executive speed and the Donna with identity of the week, they were helped to rectify. How old are you now as shipping the subject? 26, how old are you? I thought you were all down I said. Let's put it this way. When I write down my date first, now I'm the word circummixed. Many asked if I thought he seemed more mature apparently don't know what's working on having a project a more mature version of this song. Have you noticed I'm speaking slow, he asked don't have to do more. She made me watch a video myself and I know I do it too soon. I didn't even listen. But I didn't even have the likes and just didn't click there to speak. You're slowly increasing the social activity. I was gaining the impression he married Eva Bro one. She did not want any cameras at me, I thought. Just to some horrendous love, I felt something wrong with God, that's what it was wrong. He asked me how it works. He didn't keep us in our orbit. I'm seen Keith, nearly two years last time I tried to keep. He said he still was an expert. was in person, the time that slides himself and says, I have to solve, it did irritate. I mean, there was a reason to keep my study for six years, and it was a complete waste of time. Let's just, something went into it. It basically was happening. Why you talked about it in the story itself? It's sad, it's gone, you're  little girl. You all thought that anyone who's a pleasure is who. Jesus referred to the thing with Jim and his name is Samuel. You haven't been the same person since then and this one. Jesus, I'm really thinking about it. I imagine there is exuding sex with him, collecting a certain talismate relationship with love We pray for haste to arguing with the existence bop tastes what he Straßenchem and him with love but But I went along. Because I'm raised in Jimmy with so eager for his to meet. He called her up, warned the way run out of work. But I excuse myself for an emergency one-on-one, with me myself on Mason Bar for a new reason. I hope it's the light. Either that might be, or it's time to make a miracle. That's... Don, was on my business company. with her back to us. Well she was nothing at all my time to sleep. Donner was a big girl. I mean literal she must have been at least six feet too and I have to say and this was not all from the onion or some of my power. And this, that is first in the two biotections. She's probably given birth to something I've seen. When she turned around, I thought, oh I'm much better looking than you! I was sort of surprised to myself how juvenile I was behaving. But I have to say, I did suddenly put a mood to be a little bit ugly. Finally she gets some fun, boops is open, just in hand. I'm sorry she's the American suggests, I've got all the time look with. There were the man who said, I think it's been too much there. When she hears she's not there, then she will be there, he says. Hello, she is. She is. She is. She is. She may have been there, he thinks. One thing he was, was a gen. We directly are attention towards me. One. I'm not lying to you in the little eunuchs. Oops, I'm sorry. Do I sound  you? Oh, I'm not saying she's not. No, she's not. I'm just saying she's not. What a pretty shit you're wearing. I know you can't. I was only there for that. I didn't know she was a pregnant woman. Don't hesitate to meet him too. Oh! Ayay! I'm quiet! Oh, you're hilarious, she said. So are you all the time, ? She said she was an engineer when she was a little kid in China. Every time she mentioned James, I had to think about who she was talking about. You too can get real quiet, and she's... Don't be weird. and do. It was set, and she was throwing them. Jimmy, what did we give him to earth to sadt him? To the bottom of the door, to the bottom of the door, to the bottom of the door. We were driving him down. What happened to you all, charalaman and that's it? Don't ever mind we get rid of these. I  that charalatist with Synti. She approves of you. She thought you were going to. She's from a potential space that's nothing wrong with her. She said she thinks your kind of work she can imagine me being with much more than that. While she means I have her eyes. I don't know. Sometimes I think she's tired, married. I'm a fourth husband. and then we just grow for people that are saying, I can't decide what the service is . Now I remember how much I liked it, and the person just said, I can't. While Jimmy was crying, happy that this incident is still, we don't know, we don't know, should we? We split and consent. I remember, we should remember, a cast of wind, blue. through the car. My hair went everywhere. Care and all its renovative seats all matter. I don't know if it's the seat for music. Do many cappuccines or jeeping blinds don't seem  a suff-wave vintage. Yes. He must have thought my mind just fluttered out the car with me. Right now I explain. I feel  I'm blind. the world. Driving around the coast can get a huge amount of air. Do anyone get off the road? They're still going. I don't know, take me to the minister. As we were going in, he stopped these traps. I always get excited to be seen. I said, I feel the same way. I'm really not as what it was. See, it could be remade with you, not with us. The big plant was a ride that would go extremely high and then be not able to. Now I am told here of Hans. There is no way you'll forgive me after that thing I said. You guys who want to ask the hearth to sing. Our Lillian, your side of everything is set. How dare you ask it? I'm not! Come on, he said. Fear of certain point, just becomes another bad habit. Chaturved in something big up and down. The only way I think I'm big to learn, just by doing it through a top psychological stress. In which I rationalize the life of your hands, actually represent your mind. And going on big time, 6 streaming, what they could make to this house. besides of 10-year-old children, right? I'm sure they always prescribe to take the plant, giant crying, to remind me of it. Is the ride young, everyone full with it? We can. First of all, it's painful, but I see the bush through the field. I'm just saying, oh, it's not. Don't know what it is, can? Jimmy held my hands with racing, just so. I never been helps. those rides before, but ended up loving it. When on three more turn it was, it had become a big easy to use. Bit by bit the day a strange notion because my mind, I didn't mind your mercy, you thought it was a good mind. I right after me, I really asked, I really was a little you were actually. I stood at distance to see the spine, to see the spine. I want to do my second movement. This 26 is not a live single, I want to do my second movement. Then I have to do on the very school. It is a good and cheap thing. What are you doing now? I want to recuse you. That's going to be very smooth. drop the jolt into a halt, force the bass on the level. Why are you waiting to move? Jim came out and said, I think I'm blue, please. If somebody told you your life would end, you say, a year, do you think we start to really live? Would you think you'd slip back under the covers, might we, to be old? I think you'd get me when I'm tired. Just that move, just a tune. Let's be a pass. and now I can't find her. I don't have any pictures of you. I'll say come on and it's a group of existence. We will tell you about it tomorrow. You just do it. When you find you did it much for me. She wasn't found in pairs when I saw her. What should we be back about this? We will find two. We will take the love with each other. It's your game, William Jimmel. Happy. You've next to nothing of positions. Everything belonged to Darnet. One of the few things that was actually his, was this little tent that it took everywhere. It doesn't really care if I've helped the urge to sleep outside. One set, which was the best driving for the country. Sure, little package, I'm on. No sooner or after that than Jimmy said, let's forget about going home. I want to sleep under the sky. I decide the idea of different people. So we bought some sandwiches and supplies. What was the most we found this spot, which is that we should be working with. I would start the sky was my name. He set up a little tune, put out sleeping bag at the very wrong. But the time we did was night. Jimmy went straight to sleep. I don't have any other languages  you. The grand was uneven to put it mild. I think we were pumped into a mild community. Last time was one thing, what the hell was going on? And it was damned. Okay, I can't hear it. You said, come on, that girl. You could almost hear that moves, it's changed. So, I don't know. If you , still I don't have to throw your instincts, wigg it. I have a scope, I'm still wide wide thinking. I'm 41, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, and I'm laying in a field. And the whole thing seems so absurd, I just started laughing. what, I thought, good things are going to happen. I'm ready to the nail. I wasn't before. I have nail. Yes, I'll go and very low my...
