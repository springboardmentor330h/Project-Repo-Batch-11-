Some day he grows up, he would become a pro football player. And he would find men for shot spob. It's really good deal. When I looked at that kid that 15-year-old kid making her palm sits. That kid. But it's such a, it's such a particular vision of what a pro football player is, as a kid you're trying to conjure it notion of something who's very But also, pure somehow. Yes. I remember even then some friends saying, now Mark, , Coca-Cola is kind of a lost goal. , maybe high school football. I thought, you're just later when I reflect it back. I thought, yeah, it's the kids, kids, the edges, the skill. I disabuse them of some visions got. The next dad was Barron, in Fresno, California, two men came into the bar, played a game of four-quarter-two beers, and they came into the back room and shot him. They didn't take any money, he was gang-wanned, Southhead. And there was talk that Mark's father must be caught up with organized crime. So a 15, Mark started calling around, and it was mother-made of stop. 17 years later, he moved back for us now, by this time he was a reporter for the LA Times. And he wanted to write a book, best getting the dad's mother. Usosed Erissted. He and his wife got their home under assumed names. Did not tell people where they lived. It's hard to make sense for all that. There was a great deal of paranormal. I didn't want family to really know what I was doing. I thought it was some way to someone that knew it was about questions I was asking. I wanted to make a difficult for them to find me. And I never changed my seat patterns. So I thought I was awake all to the night. It's gotten house in it. and had an attempt to see the attempt. In a way I became very childlike. I really had to come see some things to get out of this thing. But how do you mean? Well, I think it wasn't terribly dull to try to come back and home town. Would that happen? in the evening. Don't. Somebody close to us dies, part of this can remain suspended there at the moment it happened. And we stayed there, part of a stays there, turning the whole thing over and over in our hands. Mark spent three years talking to the informants by the Smobbish Murder. He went through police files and elicophone records. Then the Ant-Pomp-Credible evidence that his father was murdered just as he was about to go out of the whistle on a drone, One with local police on its side, right? He wrote his book about it. It's called, in my father's name, and still that was that enough. He's still not. And I have been liberated by some of those ideas in his book. So I don't know. The relation is a lot of different. But why? What would it take? I think there's a part of me that wants to sit across from men who set this open up and I don't know. talking about. You went them to admit it, to your head. Yeah, that's fine. So I want to think. I have played over that in town, so there's so many times, and one of the things that I've been telling them going in is, it goes no, no, no further than you and me. Zip, just want my walk to ask you one question. Did you respond to me? And so actually, you actually imagined this over and over. I'm not a legend, I'm a time. Welcome to the B.E.E.E.E Chicago in Public Radio International. It's a American life, I'm a regalist. Today in our program, people trying to make sense at things for which they'll never get answers. For real, please. Hope stories in our program today are about people facing the idea of death and telling themselves one thing better than another and is there anything you can be said? Is there anything that can comfort us in that situation? Back one. One of our programs that's experienced trying to comprehend what it means when people were there alive in your life one day and the next gone. Tech 2. Look for the union label. The part of this story sounds on the surface I have to say  the script of the worst sitcom ever made. I've bothered daughters to down together for no reason just a game really. To write his a bituary, not really thinking about what it means. And then at some point someone starts to think about. what it means. Act 3. Take my wife, please. Can dwelling morbidly on future disaster Stacking your own family can that actually be healthy? One brave man depends the idea. Stay with us. Music Act 1. One of the best remarkable books that I've read in a while is by woman named Chenvi. Jirgensen, her batter husband go round and she lost their two daughters, at least until the, at the age, four and seven. The book is a series of letters that she wrote to her friend 12 years after their deaths. And one of the things that's remarkable about it is how she still struggles. She doesn't want to keep suffering over their deaths. But suffering of them is the last way that she has grubba. She's also keenly aware that she wants them to seem in these letters, to be more than just me. , when you tell a story about somebody, it's sometimes hard for them to see more just a character in the story and she keeps trying over and over to find ways to make a real, that in fact they were alive, they are more than can be expressed. You never knew I thought it's night of the genome as I was in the past. I don't have to tell you everything. And one really tells someone about very long children. I will not even show you photographs of them. All they show are two little girls, they are the distinguishable from each other. Just  all the little blind children, which people primary school classes and the beaches along the Atlantic coast in the summer. On the 29th of April 1980, their official photographer for the school was my daughter to turn their came to take some classroom rooms. They were both dead the next day. Indeed, we did not receive these photographs into several weeks after the news of her son. Matilda's class is in uniform, so it is picture of a little girl made in blue in her room. Steking her giggles into her best friends. At least who is still in nursery class is wearing a dress with a sailor calling her mother King. She is sitting in her first row with me solemnly in that room. I think that in this picture she is really very nice. In Matilda's satchel and she has a school overall. and she has written dates which will be ten to ten and ten to ten to ten to ten to ten, meaning say, thirdly to date home to me. What else can I tell? I would  you to have heard me talking to them just once even going out of telepathy. I feel powerless in time to make you accept this evidence. here I was in the mountain. I went to pick them up at school, we stopped at the supermarket to buy two cheap waxed coats one in red on the blue and I dropped them off with my mother not before playing a practical joke on her. I bundled my daughters up in the coats with hoods up, poor tight earl and nose is entirely under their chance. They rang the bell and I hit and my mother and then I went home because I was a speech therapist at the time. had patience waiting. My sister and law came as intended to pretend to open the knees up to take them to their other grandmother, but they never arrived because they died toward them after me, about ten meters from each other on the side of the mother. I'm hesitating about what to write next. There is no common ground between the foreign actor, or at least what they have in common strikes me just as... painful to excavate as most deeply very relics of the four. Yes, I'm hasty. I'm afraid of failing. I'm afraid that we will believe more readily in their death than in their lives. A few years ago I still used to drive out in the countryside and bellow at the top of my lungs, my tilt. I was really calm. Of course she did not come. At least I had spoken many times. I need ... little girl who has the same name as her and I speak it, I say, and I'm a little tim, to find the smile. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. On the eve of that Mayday holiday we were not expecting anyone to call and the ringing the telecom awakens now feelings in us. We left it. they received of the papuriasity. As late rustling on the line indicated that the call was being made from outside Paris. My sister? No, my new she was on the way to Paris. And I'm familiar man's voice checked that we burned deep the people he was looking for and he told us to walk the money. The next voice was that of her brother and my Christian who had left with his wife, their baby and our tuberals. We asked him how he wants. He said that he was not good at all. and have very serious car accident. He said, yes, and he told us how to look after him. We thought he was paying joke on us and then thought no one would play a joke in such a court taste. But, he felt he was losing his tongue, his children. I asked her news of the others, everyone was fine. Where did we have to go to the hospital at Pellon? I did not know what was. Please don't give us a few directions, mom. I immediately felt how impossible it was to raise myself to the scale of this vent. The terror amounted in me out of all precautions and dimensions. I could not contain all. I was still this little woman in your little apartment, so next to her little man in the scene. The terror target was exclusively with her own brain. It's only destination, turnous. It was a giant dream. Once. The wrong to convey the wrists and asking me not to scream, he said, to think we're going to have to get over this. A big part of us is Steve, big part of us is Steve, big part of us. I will tell you what happened next. Everything you want to know about what happened next. But at the moment you can't. Just as then, I am looking for the link between my daughters and that news. We arrived at the door of the hospital, Jean-Bremard asked where we had to go and quarter-reply him surgery. Then I thought my daughters had been operating on before they died and everything expanded into infinity. And corridors were difficult to walk. My sister-in-law at the end of the corridor, I'm circling around her, her room. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law are stranger. They asked us if we would  to see them if we wanted to see our moms. We would have to drag me down and track them. They asked us if we would  to bring anyone to let them know. I then understand that this horror does not stop us. That we have to tell them nothing. No, it's the evening. She's not expecting any news this morning. Let her sleep on the time. I was right. They knew the family record book. When they asked for it and I replied. Yes, we've brought it with us as a proud moment. We are good parents. We are living here. A lean and pretty strong, I'm going to spend the moment in the house of the baby old. All three are kept under observation. We are taken back, intact, we came to nothing. Right from the first instance that is this muffin. Mrs. Elsa just that we stayed in our house. I agree readily. She lost a son long. go at the else house we eat what we are given food and sleeping. It is not so much in words that I am lacking to tell you all that is getting courage. When I realized that I forgot something and I have to retrace my steps I say to myself, is it really worth it? Before taking the sleeping can all be thought that. over and hey, their grandparents were waiting for all God, loved ones, and others. Have I told you that they were attending the carnation in the day to the hall? Have I told you that on the 30th day of the day of the 19th, this young woman was rising to the throne, and that ever since this day has been celebrated there, the joyful and verse 3 of my bent, whose secondary factors the death of the girls. That my father-in-law pension basser and my mother-in-law were attending the best. And all the embassy staff were busy, so we had found no one to go and fetch the girls to the airport. That resigned only at the very last minute I cancelled the place to receive the minimum year plans flight. Have I told you that at my mother's house before they were picked up by their aunt, they had watched the coronation ceremony on television, as I had done a corner of my eye at home. Have I told you that seeing my father-in-law's very characteristic form, date, I told to ask for them. Spotted me. And I can still hear them back on until it forms full of discipline. No, I didn't see. , you even had passed. My mother told me that at the time a laser was turned away from the television, and observed in her drawing. But that had not stopped her from affirming energetically. But I did, I saw him. Since then I have not called until it forms. Where if I have a... out my elder starter was without the compression required. It was the field of vibration in my narrowing so those syllables chosen most 25 and 0. The arrangement of clear vowels and black consonants which were to mean the first of my children. To accompany all her own, to practice for passport, announced for arrival. To be said with on the hint of shine is in finally, in the mouth of the one who to betray all their emotions of this girl and one day listen. She alone would arouse in one young girl, a young man who would never know her. Two lives and two does not need to walk. After the funeral I went over to my mother to see my aunt and uncle who would soon be returned to What's on the wall. The concierge came out of her large, seen me as I wanted to build me. I told her I used to go to play with the daughter. She said, you will see you can get used to him. It is certainly most simple, true, brutal, and perceptive in anyone's sentiment. You could interpret it either as a message of hope or a question contempt in each. It is very strange this double rhythm that I have in the, I write to you, forcing myself to clarify a period of my life. on everything I can't understand, but which has always been out of my grants. It is said that reality outstrips fiction, that this is something else. The reality remains inaccessible. Since the death of the girls, twelve years in 16 days time, I have honestly and constantly tried to unveil this reality with her success. Perhaps I've already told you, sometimes I've eaten them alive. My doubt, my doubt, my words, these words which are so light and that's a burden some cut through me. And sometimes I believe in you death. I'm yet to know who ten or so meters from the chan. There are legs and dungries, there arms and heads on the side of the mountain. There's never a link between you. The other rhythm constitutes things I do in my current life, there's a must in the inner hand. Conversations. laughter, mutual friends, a double rhythm  W. You do not know whether they struggle against each other or in each exchange. Have I already mentioned Yasur Arab at you? This is what made me think of him. When Elise was born, I found myself battling with a huge home-revaving. The few odd ounces of milk that I was able to slime just in four hours,  the victim doesn't know where she squeamed constantly. with Matilda's cranked on the telephone because she thought, I was about me, I quickly lost my patience. I found myself brutally grasping these as crayon, which is on castors, and puriously pushing the way from head bed so that it was in danger of banging the car wall, for seven assignments, and then the crimes of the painting. On the third day my mother came to see me. She sat at the end of the bed and chatted. We were cheerful. A medium Endal Sports talking to each other but I was looking at my daughter's back in me. Drone by her gaze I leaned over her and rubbed my nose on her. She said, ah, ah. I stared at my little bit, she reassured myself and I had no dream. It'd be quite not the breath out. I did the same thing again and I was replied, I'd be a third attempt or a strange. And that was it. She was my child. My treasure, my stupid fraction. Then shezieck. ia relation. Yeah, her image is still unique. The cool reasons it was my mother who came with Matilda to pick me up from the hospital. I went down one big staircase. At the end of one of the ground floor corridors I saw Matilda and her little green load and coat. She was watching Simon and motionless, her nose pointing up another staircase. My mother pointed me out to her and Matilda started to walk onto me so. I handed a leaves to my mother so that I could lift Matilda into the right place in my arms. I can soak it in the nearest ounce of pressure on my legs. had my face. She did not say anything but she slowly and silent and felt my face in her hands long ago. During this rediscovery, this tender and cautious room, my mother was smiling with the spring-sweet memories. She had known here, Alice in the huge ice ring with black call and to confront the October weather. She was wearing wool and hat and she was a bit big water which skewed sideways over here. She could be Yasur-era Patts taught her, and I'm not sure. The other day, the radio announced that Yasur-era Patts claimed he disappeared in the sandstorm with his desert. A few hours later, although members of the Amterash were killed in Egypt, he himself was found alive in the Great. Every time the Atragic event affects him with spares in, the murder of an advisor all sorts of attempts on his life while an airplane crash. I think that's how it is. When I think about my feelings and liking them, when I think of the life expectancy they each had on that October day when my mother teasing that one daughter. To think that she is dead. I've been careful. I've never watched the home movies in which my two daughters before. , I have a listen to their voices on the answering machine tapes that my mother can. The message is to grant your help, successful, but I do nothing about it. How many catastrophes have their bins inside the man's classroom and to put you, football stadiums, collapse, young motorbiker's kill each other at the 24 hour raising the moms? And here I am, the children's milk. And I target my net which is from so deep in one. Last. week as spent a long time looking at car exactly  one usual dogmas that's seen from which they throw in which leaving their parents to go to their grandparents, they left parents and went to I was there looking at the back seat, the seat belts that you're not done on, the right hand building which they've been both maintained. The letters on the number plate confirmed that this removed five was when the seniors must have walked this long. and wrote this book. No, no, no. Left, I don't know, I'm going to get you to ask questions on them. Someone want to keep watching. After the impact on my sister in law managed to bring her car to a park, she and her husband turned to be a little smile to children. On their babies there, sitting here and will see the stupid lives and fragments of glass from the community. They already told you then. I took a chance. self-sufficient. When I was near that, I'm not five the other day. I wanted to lie down on your seat and wait for the end of time. In short, that's a staple. I have some work to hand in, a lot, but nothing will get done until I've written. At first it was the other way around. Everything came for lessons. I used to tell myself, why is suffering? That's the point of this artificial boundary, this long lawsuit. I'll said something happened to you. Now even as I get up, I'm carried by the things I want to write. I should have gone to see in that room the hospital when they commit all this. I knew as soon as they suggested it to me, I knew that by refusing out of some precedent for a future weakness because I'm not worthy of. I did not go to see them dead. They were there and mummied in the house. They were on one two rooms away, they were named mummied in the house. Mummied did not cross the doorway. And nothing of their faces is there. They had the strength to die and I did not manage their skin. Nothing of their last great achievement. We were every day went, they went alone. Together were our part, and I'm inclined to believe it was a part, ignorant of their own heroism. They went into places dictated by an environmental trajectory from what the 100 kilometers per hour in the city. I stayed on my chair  a lump. And since then people have not stopped congratulating me for more courage as I'm to such an extent that money. friends including you hesitated before talking to us about the difficulties and hardships they were facing. They did not see worthy from Paris. We were on tonight sat in the throne of pedestal, poised it thereby in annihilation and art in the cross. But we so knew it really  the words, the weather map of the past, change the skies and we needed people to tell us, because the air was clean about us, and we were so happy to see it. The only stance that I battle against is to threaten Sue. side. To keep those around you on 10 to hocks because you're going to die, watch out and then kill myself. Now goodness, they're living you can make a fuss with their moods and they're rather have running all over the place trying to stop them. You're going to kill myself, watch out, watch out. I don't know, that is not how it is. I will explain to these maniacs until and we as many as you can. If I can, that is because they didn't open themselves. And when the adults came to their senses and began to realize they were no longer in the car, not even under the front seats where they looked once they lived in the rear seat presenting. When they had to resign themselves to getting out of the car to look from them, they had to be found wherever they might be. When it was done and they had been found, dozens of meters from the car and dozens of meters apart, they had actually already gone. We found a word, two places. moment in sea. All of the springs we back to that moment, wait we saw my chair when, even though two children my two children, two very young children, had known how to die, and were waiting to be presented to me one last time in truth and is. I had not even gone these few meters long for it or had set me in the tent for me. They had known how to die, I know how to die. There has been nothing glorious about the earth, not . I love them living in all of them I ask them, I love the dead for their tomorrow. There is nothing new to me. Our children now, Elvira and Gautier, have asked us a hundred times whether they would have been born and their sisters have not died. hopes of what I just cannot. Girls death allowed me pregnant to manage a mother to have their children. Even so, at the square with the children I was not  other mothers, sitting up and trying to send the sand. I would watch my own working life pies, I would both to a suck at this. Another woman wanted to talk to me. I had on two options. A bright massage, devastating. Yes, mine's already three and a half. which is still bright in the sky. You can't believe you will strap the secret up the top of the line. Or a truth that will socialize the world. These are my known tips. The open space dies. I would always be on the place. Working class, immigrants, self-taught cramps, the handicapped, unemployed, and grieving parents are more ... We have it. is one thing you have to make her kill me and have this to hold the normal for now. These want to be something that your scene is on your belt behind on the ladder. I'll be here as we see the postcard from the friend now some depth of last night. I was hoping to see as in my browser state I could get voice to my co-op realtor and talk about the spectrum of sleep. You can do that until a good day I enter. You can see this moment is coming soon. Go to your desk not once you're about anything to do with that. So when you're told you can get as few things and hardly grow confidence And fear was left alone, because she had just learned from one person, holiday cards that she never did in that school. And it's my honor to be turned into bird nothing, killing sure that I'll hear you respond to something I've been seeing. She joined me on the bed, buried herself against me, sighed, crying. She had been telling me about this one's illness, and she was scared. I knew that Ryan came to school, and she was crying. changed because that her mother who was always cheerful, came to pick her up from school to younger children, asking her when she could get out and move in the locker as she moved to the child, still has 10 to 15. That was it. Well, it's not too cold. Elder who told me about that too, but now as she cried, she realized she had never imagined that Lauren would actually come. And this death, this ends to everything. This ends to everything. which meant the child could not be told to the meeting. Locker did not begin next at Dem決定. This was so harsh and so invincible that Elvira had only tears to mean the two realities that of a lie yesterday, which was completed in the state of Colour. And Dem, which was a turn on in the first room. Now, even as she struggled with the sharp peeing, she already knew that she, very soon. this being softened. And despite her softs, her shadow broke down with her face, she was already missing purity because we're both in part of Eden and cut it. And she used to accept the softened the softened waters should go away죠. I'll be here tomorrow This idea of redouble your anger. Parfum hoping to suck less, she never wanted the questions that needed to do. This was the only step in response to a dispute every part of her confusedness. As I listened to her, I loved her, but I'm not really interested at everything. And I thought it was less than just so many years later, I Attorney to discover exact hypnotism comes off. Hi. My guest. Viele dirhalag I'm Walgreens Esco, Good evening. Pero I'm grateful, Coming up, that takes a holiday and while it's gone, can you feel better about tragedy by talking about its indance? And if not, what's talking for anyway? A minute upgrading to National. I'm discovery. This is American Life from our class. Each week on our program of course which is theme, we've variety of different stories on that theme, this program. Tell stories in the face of death. In each of our next day, somebody come. by its the dad of some of your shoes close to him. And then surround that idea of that dad with words, and stories, even though there's some great in that situation, words and stories cannot be a good book. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. We've arrived at Act 2 of our program, Act 2, looked at the union label. In this Act 2 people, Father and daughter, and the start of the post story about dad, before anyone else permitted. It's hard. Well, simply began by sitting in the kitchen of my home, reading the Boston Globe, and to look down at the beautiful fall day looking at the map of the train front of my eye and suddenly the curtain leaves at the right of my obituary, or began working on no special reason. It must have been probably over the... Christmas holidays probably last year and you were visiting your visit. So my parents, , around that time and I was looking at what I was on to tell a foreigner was just for a pet of papers right down. And I just noticed on a pet of a yellow leaf had my father who started writing his obituary. But it wasn't labeled obituary. No. It just, , it said born in 1917 to, . out when he and it just was incredibly straightforward and standard in it. And I just can't believe it. I didn't actually have an emotional response to the obituary part of it all of it. I guess I was confused in the way because he is such an interesting person. The book, , the writing was just a must-based details about his family. And it didn't really say anything about him. Now there's he's a much more interesting person than writing. So, right, and I don't know, and I didn't really process the thought I just went straight to and I said dad, my god, this is so boring. I said, I lived for much more interest in life than this, and these dwells, and help me write it your writer, help me write all he knew was what the headlines should be. That was sort of the one very clear thing, . And then what should the headlines be? They have lunch, the, , Zna, I'm named Afro. Say, Adrian. Look, I'm kind of a product of the working class. That was what he saw. That's what makes me that very important. When I say the working class, I'm talking about work, ? Yeah. So what my history from the first factory job, first learning what a union was, and then began a committee man and the president of local youth, , where I work. And from that. on a  gravitate will become your contact field representative. I tend to take positions I do this  everyday in my life and I think that the obituary was  saying there are still union guys around following yeah that was pretty much  saying look  eight two years later from sixteen to twenty there is still guys  making the pitch And so we sit down, , I'm pretty sure that first day was said, down I my portable computer, , and I said okay, so how do we do this? What do we do? And I just need you to tell me about your life. I've actually tried to do this my dad before not in the context of the obituary, but those moments where I felt going to work about my family history. So I said, down, wait if you are deaf.. watching the documentaries or whatever is reading.. If I could say sorry, I would never write but in my book Fine... I really do know that because I was from studying the best of the best night as from very responsive. He'd be very vague. But for some reason when he was thinking of his life in terms of pitch-wary, a lot of details came out that I don't feel I could have why I did. I wasn't able to get my was trying to just have the straight conversations about his biarch, , dart, or to file. That's what I mean, if it was an enjoyable process, talking to you, go to it. Yes. Yes. She's got a... I find her to be a search and a prober with good instincts and caring. So I don't know, was just interesting, it came very easily. I learned so much about her. Since it was in a bitch. where you did the utility talk that is yet. No. That's something that I think is, I don't know, it's funny, , in preparing for this, , several of my friends were asking me about it and it just sort of shocked me a little bit. They were thinking about it in that way and of course it really is. It is no bitch wearing. It's good. Yeah. Just answer to the questions. I think he must and I think over the years he's known how anxious my brother and I've been about dying. So I think he often tries in his way to help us cope with it. He doesn't seem nervous, right? So I don't know. When I go to visit, I find leading my parents sometimes quite difficult because they are over. older and I'm very busy and I don't get back as often as I'd  to. And I think he knows how hard it is for you to say, you buy and he'll say, , you'll say, I'm always with you. , , always with you. That's something. I don't need to solve classes. Go anywhere. Baby. It's cute. He's doing this often. Right, I believe it's very possible. It's very possible. Probably why he was a good union organizer. Because I'm feeling  I'm helping him. Do something. Now he was good at what he did. It's one of the reasons that you agreed to talk to your daughter about the obituary and worker. any of it is very is is to help her prepare for the thought that you might die. So it could be I've had I haven't stayed with that thought but could very well be I right maybe you're flowing in. I think that thought is trust my mind but I haven't stayed with. I am saying that you could be partially right. No, is there a way to ever have not tried with wanted to be easier, but I wonder if it's possible? The possible is no, that's  you're saying that better how you try to be better. That's the first person. The really is nothing we can do, we think better. Yeah, I get it. I mean, I mean, it's obviously I've been working on it up the way I'm really thinking. At all, about my father dying. , nothing that it's about death. Just thinking that it's about talking my father. Then I have all the time speaking to myself. I don't know. It's part of, , it's part of my relationship. And it will be what happens when it's over, when it's just gone. And my brother-in-law passed away, who was quite sick before he died. And he was, , coma, right up to the moment. He actually did die. There was such a vast difference between him. Even though he was available as the person he knew, his physical life was so in-maps. And when it was gone, was the loss of it was just huge. , it was huge. in it, it happened in just a minute and I just was so shocked by that because I was so ready for him to die. I knew that he was going to die. He wasn't really with us anymore and it was for some reason. And I was glad that I was able to at least understand how little I actually knew about it. So how far did you go on the other day? No. Now, I haven't actually, I can't figure out how to write it except in the past tense. Just seems. We can start to speak of him that way. So I understand she hasn't finished writing her. No, we haven't completed it. Because she's taking too long, getting this done. Do you  things she's taking too long? Yeah, no, we're starting to figure it out. Yes. It's no great rush. The dynamite. Well, wait, you have a feeling it should be a time date. No, are you rushing the process? No, I have no intention to rush the process. I'm not going in, but I'm still bowling. I'm still bowling. I'm still going in. I'm still bowling. I'm still bowling. I'm still bowling. I'm still bowling. Adrian LePlanck and started. Awesome. It's a great song. Stop where! Over the rainbow! Lover the spot! They're flying high! Over the rainbow! I wonder why I love a pooch come here some way Ooooh, look arrange more Whaaaare Yaaaay Ooh, eh I'm so happy. Actually, take my wife. These, some of us have tragedy, crushed harness. Some of us creep up tentatively to the edge of thinking about our worst fears. And only allow ourselves to put moments to contemplate them. We're bearing all thought of tragedy deep in back-sparmines again. And then, some of us choose to think about the worst that can happen all the time. And, is that good? One of the producers of this American life. She was snider, has this story about her brother? A little over a year ago, I was in the car with my older brother Tom, coming back from a weekend trip to our dad's house. And just as we were entering Chicago, he began to tell me about how whenever he says goodbye to someone, or hangs up at phone, he ended up in a conversation. What goes through his head is that might be the last time when we were talking to them. And that's just the beginning. And then I think about what would happen, what would I do, and what would be their accident? They could have heard some signs for him. It's good to know. Who would take your funeral plans? Who would call the cops? I guess, we'd be initially to attach the body. They call the cops first. It's a simple play involved. The way I was part of it. My wife was on the same track. I'd  to investigate to see if anyone's going around or not. Would I be able to freak out or be able to handle see the side of  my particular wife loved one, though? That had to be mutilated. It's at this point, Thomas. What, what do you  that? It's just great. I didn't know  a cops involved. Well, yeah, good personal use. That was on the scene. I mean, I mean, there's no sense in talking about the funeral and in your life thereafter, if you can deal with  what happens right away. How does really specific points for what I'll do with almost every member of family gods? But is most detailed scenarios for this one? Please, what am I going to do? to get to the initial day. What's going to have to curb body? Is it going to go to the quarters office? We'll be in autopsy probably. And what happens when I come home, who all what will my words be for her parents? We'll have to explain them all with the she's that. How many was I on? Of course, we have where I was sleeping. I call them sleep at night. How am I going to eat? OK, am I going to go to work? We'll be able in the morning period first week. just carve out a couple hours and then you can just take a time off. I have a lot of lost school that still but then again of course my wife's life is a shirt, shirt, job so I'd have that extra money. What I continue to live in the house or that day, I think , now just pregnant of course, so well to be a shirt. Do you think Andy Hall is going to be doing this for? , it's got my 32s, so probably, , 10 years probably. Yeah, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. People who are supposed to be dying. There's nobody here. I'm sure they would think this way. But maybe that's why,  this way. Because  it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm just waiting for the happen. But every time I come home, , let's see if message on the answer machine. Particularly at night. At night. I'm thinking, , because it's going to be the call. That's bad news. I just need to stop right here and say that my brother is much more normal than all of this makes him see. He's really smart and funny and sweet. He's a successful attorney, married and has the first baby. It's just that he worries a lot. , I think it's more of a, I mean, by definition, more of it. I'm thinking about people's morbidity, but mortality. I think it's practical too. I mean, it makes me appreciate the first so much more than that. You play the Anthem machine, it's just a telemarketer. , , my mom must not be dead. Because of course, that happened, I would get a phone call. And we go, I'm cheating, I just have one here, go. My mom, who I love is alive. So I think that, , I don't see any detriment to the way I think about things that are not. You should not present with people dying because of them. , yeah. I think this kind of emotion was a person very quickly. Yeah, I certainly do. I would add it out. Well, to my family and to my friends. The only motion that I've revealed, I'm thinking this way, is kind of, I know your desire is , kind of a satisfaction and knowing that I care so much, and that so much, , if this person was to go, how much this person meant to go. I mean how much state that we're helping in my life, to make my life better. It just gives me a sense that you're not that, and I've thought often past about the built delivering newalities that people's super funerals. In my mother's, my grandparents. So I thought about all the good things I would say. My dad's been well too, I think they would say, , celebrate their lives. They know what's happening. I asked if you had a newogy for me. He says it's pretty much the same speech I gave him already. I don't think I wouldn't care to raise a name for the brush or she'd thrill so much. Just something that  is gonna happen, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're not gonna be around, probably see all that happened, but I hope that then I have I don't know, I was just thinking there's nothing wrong with me this way and I think it's a tough. I know my wife disagreed with me and I know she thinks that if I were to tell anybody that she's now I am, I think this way I'm going to be the first suspect if she never murdered and no one knows who did it. I know who the contact in terms of our life insurance and I already have everything planned out. I'm going to scare peers where I'm going to lose. Settara. Bye. I don't think that that's bad. I really don't. I'm sure not of it. None of my plans will come up. Happened. But you're still thinking about it, I think. Huh? And then I'll be able to do it. To think about it happening and then have it not happen to be glad that it didn't happen. I think better takes away the fear of it happening a little bit more for this feeling just in my old mind, thinking of dealing with it. Okay, that person could die. If I get a little many fear that the person is not there as I'm climbing up the stairs, I don't think my wife is that in fact, but she's not in course I can blow many rushes. I also get to feel  it helps calm and  well look, I couldn't doubt with it had that good case, which I think I would really push. Do you have any plans for Blue you're not planning to? There's been friends of mine who, yes, no, I do. There's been friends of mine, male friends. I have picture dying. And I think about what type of relationship I would maintain their wives' kids. Would I step in and try and do a lot in terms of what, , I don't know what taking this kids of all games obviously, never, in the place of their father, what would I just, , pay my respects, let the wives come in. I think it's helped. I do think, , now that my friends, they had died. I thought I had pictured their dying, because he had had a heart attack, prior to the heart attack, killed him. And I thought, , that my friend would be a lot of sports, a lot of attention. But I ended up, not doing  a few phone calls, it's very strange, a few phone calls, I made two initially to talk about it and then we would continue talking, I make a point of call every week that I never wanted to talk about, kind of as that of just that, I did not want to talk about that with them, I wanted to ignore it, just get behind it and he would bring it up a few times and bring up some of your story stuff, I think I remember thinking myself as a squirreable I should, I should be able to talk to him about the bad time, but whatever reason, just to get up, yeah. I mean, I kind of once countered my free-flowing pro-processes when people don't want to do this and ask me to think, what's he's talking about it? I think I would not just expect myself to be even a little bit more shit. And you're kind of thinking about these plans sort of , , it's true to the real one move, another job that can set, do you then also? about , through all the way to the end and then plan for  the moment that I think everybody goes for a certain moment and you kind of  have to let go that person do you everything for that? no no no no I don't I don't think that is a scary thought to me honestly thinking about  letting some go yeah I will catch you for my life right so okay I'm not gonna go on, I'm not gonna think about you, Lisa, Tina and Martin, my mom anymore, because , more and more, you're gonna just get us to join and tell her, be. So, no, I would hope I would never happen to you.
