  "text": "From the BB-Easy Chicago, the Public Radio International, it's a American life from our class. Father's Day soon. I was about 9 or 10, and my parents were splitting up, and we lived in a very small rural town in North Dakota. And my dad, he left, and he left the house, and he got in the apartment in the city. And he's a farmer. To go and see him somewhere, where there was no lawn or pets. for a few of our trees and just flatten us out the strange plus the back of the tree. First time we had an intersystem brother so other dads, apart from them, after the parents separated, they were uncomfortable. The whole separation made them uncomfortable. They had to see him in weeks. And then there was the apartment itself. We went up the stairs and it was a three-flat behind the grocery store across from the library. we had that apartment smell. cabbage and all. and then we went in and it was  a living room and then a kitchen and then a bathroom. And I remember I was , wait, where's the paper? And he's , that's the great part. , this is the cool part. See those doors? Open the doors. And I went over to open the doors and there's just metal, straight. And that's the bed. And it's called a Murphy Bed. I'd never seen one before. Inside the pool of town and pert. down and pull it down and make this really awful noise ,  it was, , need to be oiled. And I hated seeing it. It was  a lumpy mattress and  there was thin blanket on it and it just didn't look it was very good quality or comfortable. And we would sit on it sometimes to watch TV and remember just thinking this is so weird to sit on a bed and watch TV. It's in the olipathetic and lonely and it's lonely and depressing anyway because  your parent just putting up a tendency where your dad is living and it's not nice. Oh, and it was so incongruous with who I knew him to be. I mean, he's someone who belongs outside, working outside animals, pets, agriculture, all that, and here he is in this heart. And he even hated the word apartments for a while. I remember seeing it in books or animals reading. I think it's somewhere in the newspaper. It's a part of it. It was really part of it. Was that the first time you saw him say, well, yeah, I mean he'd always been, my horse used to get out, the scape and the climb up road for  miles. I would meet him. And my dad would just conflict with him, or drive, find him in the beanfield and lead him back. I mean, he was my, who else could do that. ? But here in this apartment, and it seemed kind of cowed by it. They would do all's clothes did up. So I saw him just being kind of helpless. As the years went on, we could resume this whole song. So we could stay more  the future at home in that apartment. No. That image was kind of shout it could never regave. He never regained the statue. Never regained the statue that he had before them. Before that, he was that year to be with them. Leo is nine. She has a repair and it's hadn't split up. She probably would have had two or three more years. She would have kept her dad on that pedestal. Four adolescents would have had any would have come down to size in that. No, father did not. And that would have happened. And they'd come to work from that. It was more charming to have. Do you regret that you lost those years of idealizing the more do you think? I think it matters. I think that it really, it was so painful. And you're so young. And just , you don't need that. You need to make a difference. You need it for more years. You need to have it cut to you on your own terms. I don't think that it's good when it happens in a way that you don't control. And the way that it came about, when it was natural, it was very shocked. It was  one day, it was there, and two and a slater that you knew was not there. What's the difference between the two? What's the difference between the two? What's the difference between the two? What's the difference between the two? Here's the story of everyone and their dad. Once, that is on a pedestal. Then we got older. came off at a school. And with some dads that happens more or less gracefully, with others, it is a quick painful crash from which none of the participants ever would have used for them. And how a father manages that descent from power, that transition being human sized with his children, and that, that, that, that, that, that really has been a lot of really decent guys for our current. Today on our radio program, we bring you three stories about who's handling their calls up and store it's best they can. at one of our show driving the horse maveo but I haven't seen your dad go some hero to link around in a corvette and walking at girls in one month back to and if that diamond ring don't shine the in brown explains the lines of normal dad go through to try to do right by his daughter on her birthday and how this innocent wish let him in his life to the most corrupt and most questionable birthday stunt they or any of their friends had ever heard of A degree, Legend of a Bank Rapper's son. What if your dad was never on a pedestal of a start with? And if you find yourself still somehow imitating him? Answers, see what is. At one, driving the divorce material. Kids whose parents divorce,  Lille, are often forced to see the parents as human-sized, all of a sudden, way before. they want. And if there is a separate culture in this country of diverse kids, this story is at the heart of the tradition. This story is swapped  trading cards. This story of parents and how they acted in those first few months after they split up. Those first few months when they were perfectly flawed from the things. And to start our show today, we've collected the fathers, right after we get to this. Our dad, take my brother and I out on Sundays, give him Sunday. And... This one time took us out. Anyone tell us where we were going. Till we pulled up to this shopping mall that had this fair going on. And so I just remember, I had a small surprise. You're the music player. We were so excited. We went to the ticket booth and bought a big one of tickets. Just a great day. And first ride went on. Because this airplane ride, we could go around the circle and there. and go up and down, you had to go in prior to the gunning. And I remember  every time circular that was washing us, that's where we sort of go around and every time we go around, people, the stickships, so we would rise up. This is as we pass our dad, we can show up on him. And my dad would wave to us as we go by. It's really nice moment. And then in prior to the three or four times. We noticed the third talking to this guy, the side of him. And we were  one in second. That's all. And then  the next time around, they were  closer together. We were  one in the first. It's going on. And then the next time around, the next time  it, this guy's got my dad, kind of  a headlocker. Just got my dad's shirt pulled up over his back. wrestling him, trying to punch him, the brother-in-law in shock. And up. So we kept going around and  instead of pulling those thick ships  we were just closing them, we were constantly in the air, surfing around and by now we'll crowd it gathered and  kind of egging everyone on  head of head of head of I guess the one image that stays in my mind is some see my dad's exposed halo light back because his shirt was up around his shoulders. And finally when the ride had ended, we jumped out of the plain and ran over to my dad. But then I think , the crowded separated, the two of them, I remember this lady coming up with my dad's father, she should have punched them, she should have hit them in the face. And my dad was , oh, you kids want to go on some rides, , you took us over to the side of the ride. So if you're taking tickets in my groups of all, I want to go home now. Just connect them, damper off the day. So what my dad was talking about is , I was trying to get a little bit off of it. Once we got back in the car, the fighting was not the answer. I think , I was talking to 10. But I thought it was time you get to 8. You sure it's already off your back, would you? When I think of my father, I think of a very kind, dry, retiring, very British, kind of man. Everything he did was very measured, very calm. , he was talking about a guy who made music, his personal soundtrack, found his radio station, and the play music all day, kind of wandered around humming. So I'd hear him running around the house. But once said, My parents got divorced, he joined the Y, started working happily just late. And , suddenly he was saying incredibly bizarre things , , I'm going to the gym and I'm going to weigh a lot in my packs. When he was first divorced, he didn't really have a place to live. It's kind of a hasty divorce. So he was having us live in his office. We just visited him on the weekends. And his office consists of... of this sort of psychedelic blue couch and of course the shaggy rug and unfortunately no bathroom. So he would actually get me to go to the bathroom with him on the roof into a cook bottle and somehow he made this fun to go out into the roof and  practice my name and it was actually became  a fun thing to do that actually with the flowers here during the day. and have a really good competitor. , he's always insisting on showing me this non-existent muscle group  me, sitting watching TV and I can hear him thundering down the stairs, generally! Sure enough, I go out there at the bottom of the stairs, and make it flexing  this, divorce, say, pumping iron iron with sweats and egg, swam in the ground is vice of to see how they're growing. It's just absolutely grow. I knew David with him. I was about 10 years old. I wasn't used to certain habits that there were. One of them was where he would sit in a living room with a hairdryer on his head. I'm completely naked. And it's surreal enough to see your father under a hairdryer. I mean, I'm talking  the old one. And I remember bringing over this friend of mine. And we walked. I'm not in in my desk completely naked and  we're we're then we decided to just leave and as we're leaving My dad says well you guys gonna go out and boardy tonight and  he's still in this kind of single He sort of thought I was a single guy too And of course you started dating He told me about these women He always insisted and calling them madame Whereas ma down part of the bomb hardwood You Wilson, you never met any of these women, so they're  these fancy dogs that I presume existed but it was difficult because you're embarrassed of your father, any of you, you're embarrassed, it's your dad. And then here he is, cutting the core of that light, you're a progressive girl. And there you are, ten years old, you're now in this popsicle colored tree for that, this rusted has fallen for us. We talked to a half dozen dads about on this, and we discovered that the most part they did not have some memories. The moments when they realized kids were singing a little bit. Maybe the kids noticed because for a child, any kind of change in what they used to is huge. Maybe, it just said the dads, understandably, more importantly, that they were not diminished in their children's eyes. And didn't let themselves notice. change. Fortunately, that post story about this one. I call the boys every day and talk about what I'm talking about in the days. And one day I was on the phone with my eight-year-old Alex. So we were having a conversation and there was a law in the conversation and I decided to say that. And then he just asked me, Mom. And I almost started to cry, I was so taking the back by his perception. And I was honest, I said, no, I'm just kidding. Even in this case, this dad didn't really think that this kid saw him that different, sensitive horse. Since seeing him so far, since seeing him cry, one time we did notice the change in his hands. Ryan Masters, which at all. Since he and his wife split up eight months ago, his young son started looking out for him. They didn't care of him. The way he never had the boy with him. Probably the first thing that he started doing was helping him grab on the swiffer and on doing the hardwood floors and sleeping porch. Going around and opening up windows to kind of fresh him and playing cell phone. , just sort of some. the kinds of things that you don't think of a kid even having on their radar. What else would he do to try to be their sponsor one or in the house? He runs through this sort of checklist on our way out the door. Do you have yourself on? Did you come up with your other? Is it back door locked? , little litany of things that he knows I'm going to be worried about later. He's nine? , ten. He's ten, yeah. Well, that is... it, right? Didn't it? Oh, I know. I would love it if that only made him happy. The fact is it also makes him think the same. Because, well, because no position, position, can't get the place. As much as I tried to pick you up, not in the specific, but especially in the early go on, martial with them. you're a teacher, you'll be doing this homework. I'm being reading magazine. They look across the country. She's working. But she's a good girl. I love how the second satin's after she's really pretty is she's a good girl. Yeah she's probably. I bet she's a good girl. Did you get to learn new things to cook after entry as you ? I had to remember to click, which was the hardest part in the darkest days. It was just remembering that kids need to be fed just down their every day for things to go well. And occasionally, you would, about 7.38 o'clock at night. Very chatually say, hey,  what it'd be me, did I? She went, is that up in the? that is, , it's really hard for the child, for the parent to be prematurely taken from them as a superperson. But hard is that for the dad? Oh, it's a terrible experience. I mean, talk about it, talk about a failure. And it was important to me to be able to, you know, the gentlemanly reclimit him some of that ground, not just to appear to, but to actually did you, did you consciously try to reclaim? Absolutely, sure. , those weren't proud moments in my life to realize that my kid had begun to look out for him, that my kid had begun to come aware of the changes in my own. Video in the Spanish thing? Well, I won't be doing anything with marshers and there is no one to date with. But I get to stand with him. Unless we make some fun with this session. to do so when we end we haven't just yet so I would suspect that Sunday will be will be a little important. Okay, this is Kishabhi Al-Ahm. They're interesting to see if a Marshal could use a satin steps in. I'm hopeful that he will and on another level I'm trying to hope for that the whole thing slides past him that it isn't concerned for him. That would be strange if he's comforting to me. Why, explain that, why that would be a sign for it, maybe, healthier. , it would be, if that were to happen, it would be an indication that he's less aware of my loneliness and less aware of my frail to in a little less, , concerned about it. Yeah. Let me a great problem, yeah, no? Be a great agent. Thanks for the kids and down. me. I did. Back to. And if that time, you ringed on shine. There are moments when a dad is tested, and on this father's day, what is the examine one of them? The daughter's birthday. Ian Brown is a writer and a radio host for the Canadian broadcasting corporation. He has this story about what it means to be a dad who is merely human-sized. He recorded this at a American life show that we didn't find a fly-voltaiances in Boston. He's a father. No one arrives, fashionably, late, for the seven girls birthday party. That offense will one of parental life, never waste free babysitting. But all seven guests at my daughter Hayley's seventh birthday party were dropped off by their parents, mysteriously, seven minutes, early. That sort of behavior is just plain rude. It was  being swarmed by a gang from planet time. They dropped their coats in the hall, and immediately scattered to the farthest corners of the house some new, realistically contagious, form biological weapon. I staggered upstairs with a small mount of coats in my arms. She's not... have choreized some of myself performing back when I was young and longing to be grown up. Even when I was 11, I wanted to be married because married people I knew had sex every night of their lives. That's not a story. I was lugging coats. Back downstairs, Trish, the mother of K.T. Hey, the best friend, too best. friends ago, Trish shot me a knowingler, magician night, having to tell us, fiber optic wants by the force. That was the first hint. My wife and I might have gone slightly over the top first day of the race. That we might have stepped over the strict moral boundary that separates caring, thoughtful parents, who believe in personal attention. I'm going to tell you, Trish shot me a knowingler, having to tell us, fiber optic wants by the force. That we might have gone over the strict moral boundary that separates caring, thoughtful and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful, and thoughtful Call the daytime from cheeseballs  us Who tried to apply their way into their children's heart? It's easy to commit that social gap these days my wife and I both work The harder we work the guilt you feel they more we want daily birthday parties to be Well, this is both a matter of space would be gratifying We've been planning daily seventh birthday, or to be slightly more accurate, my wife Johanna had been planning as an Ivy with nothing. For weeks, what there was was cake, iced, five professionals. In the shape of a magician's top hat, rich cost 30 bucks. a tropical aged brokerage peanut-free party favors. As $15 a bag. And of course the magician himself at $150 to 2 hours. He called himself the amazing Robert. I don't think he meant that I run a thing. I  to do- of Special Aunt Hayley's birthday. Still, don't you think I said to my wife the sheep frantic, tried to find a magician who wasn't booked three months in advance? Don't you think you might be over empty? But honey, if we don't go slightly crazy, Johannes said quite logically, some other parent will. Then what's he going to think? And anyway, do you have a better idea? And I did not have a better idea. contributions of the magician party had been to suggest that we include a woopy cushion in every loop bed or at least it was my idea to blow them up and put them in the loop bags pre-inflated. In the old days when Daily with small people, we kept to grip they simple. I learned that lesson when I lived in Los Angeles and your Beverly Hills. In Beverly Hills parents  their children's birthday parties have a theme and a fairly significant theme that that manifests destiny, say, or a NASA moon shot. In LA, I never went to a birthday party to teach you anything less than home units. One mother actually gave our Gucci t-shirts in the loop bags. It was hard to compete with that. In an active appliance, a friend of ours is struggling right, staged her daughter's birthday, apart from the promises. Kids have been at times regretting around, swan on swings, play tag, generally revoked in a whole two hours when they weren't under the watchful eye of a man or armed response security. The grab bags contained what grab bags are supposed to be taken, and rather the Rolex watches. Afterwards, the Beverly Hills parents flocked, a little bit of them flocked round on the fence. Fabulous idea they said, Nature who would have thought can I steal a theme? But our friend Catherine is the queen of the less is more easier on mum and birthday. She says children want strong experiences on youth, which is why last weekend for her daughter Mary seventh book, Catherine invited civilization, the six girls over to string gummy bears onto extra long bamboo satay skewers. That was the theme of the party. Steering candies on stick. There were some risk of eye injury and the entire gimmick seemed to have Freudian undertones. The little girls kept saying, I'm gonna stick this skewer of gummy's tiny butt. And Giggling hysterically. But all at all, it was a winner. Only one girl part. The entire party cost 15 bucks. Canadian. It is true that Catherine had a pinata. The Nioca is her excellent, because they entail hitting an object. Violent, you're the stick. The Dose were the old pre-backen alien for the days. By the time Hayley turned five, the year of our most corrupt and their foremost successful. We've gone as low as it. We've got, we've hired human body. For $300, human Barbie dressed up in full-sized versions, Barbie doll outfits, came to your house. Human Barbie arrived in a Dodge Dragon. and Karavan with human nature assist. Two giant mobile racks party dressed for the girls, the T-Setting case, two chess make. Dressed kids discuss the possibility of multiple careers. And said them came. All our friends were deeply formed. I might as well have said, oh, this. year, Haley is having a crack party. We're having a cake made of crack too. My Canadian friends put this crass in the stow to the fact that Johanna, my wife, is American. But successful. Well, it was as if the Dalai Lama had made a stop at our house. The girls were hypnotized with all. They spent most of the afternoon standing in a circle, brushing, human, bodies. I had the feeling that secretly, quite a few mums wouldn't have mind at giving it to cry for so, as it turned out, I needed to worry about the amazing robber for magician, either. He was a handsome guy. with sideburns, a grime, if someone designed. Man, the new one he's doing though, he started cracking jokes and hits right away. He must be Hayley said to one of boys, as he walked with a door, no Peter said, I'm a boy, clap to his hands. Hey, the magician said, no clapping. So all the kids clap. I said, no clapping. By the time he started going eggs out of there, no, he's really gone. And I chose that moment, he ran upstairs. I find I need to. of all glow-ups, regular inter-based cities, kitty, birthday, vashes, also at the dolphins. Pack a juice of all glow-red love now. But when I open the door to my bed, what do I find? Line, line on my bed, surrounded by entire Mount Ranges, miniature winter coats, two of my adult guests, holding me. There's spouses in downstairs. I must say they played a cool, but headache, they weren't set. Robin here, temples, non-bred I asked. Yeah, I said these kids' parties, who, I tell you, I left class, they weren't laughs, so if we didn't know. downstairs the amazing Robert was making cards disappear, reappear, the trash, 80s, mum. She kept staring, just, I thought she disapproved it. tricks. The little shuri, I know,\" said, I knew I knew that magician is just come through a terrible divorce from a birthday come. Which pretty much says it all, does that? It's terrible getting old at this point. Let's, the no child believes that they want to get old, If you're seven, you can't wait to be nine. I mean, nine, that is gonna be the greatest. Because they think life just gets better, better, better. The older you get, we grow nubs. We know better. Oh, think we do. Or at least we need. But I didn't have much time such a long gone's rank on food. Because a new sound was walked again, but sound it is rank. It's a really good, fast-food content, better. Thanks for having the loot bags. Cras, shirt, cheesy, absolutely. Growing up, not at all. That's what I . The end round is the author of Man Medium Rare and Free Reeling and hosted video program called Talking Growth on the CBC. Coming up, more parental nudity, very very very very very harmless parental nudity. Which is frankly the only way I can take it. I don't know about you. That's in a minute. I'm not making God inventata This is American Life, America. American Life, America. Last, each weekend our program of course we choose some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, for Father's Day, stories about dads with the move from the pedestal of eternal grandeur that's where we're entirely from the style, we've arrived at a career of our show, that great legend of the Ben Grabber's song. The Clint's father deserted the family not long after the first film was made in the middle of the hall. Father was a check forger and a band grabber and for a brief period in the 70s, certain time for it. makes mother for it to bring up work for her bank and at one point if they split up saw the dad on a wanted poster, she brought home and showed his brother saying that you dad eventually under rather odd circumstances, Nick and his father met and started to get to know each other. I think I'd already heard about my father being prison and I knew the news that and off my heart, and I was probably dies or so , and I was actually pretty heavily then also in doing drugs. And I'm more than concerned about, she's sort of , , I think she was afraid that I was, , that I was just gonna be  him. And it probably very difficult for her to have me in the house, , she's , , made a choice to leave her relationship  that and now her I was sort of becoming that person. I remember we were sitting in the living of our house and she, . I'd probably come home one more night, , completely shattered. And I think I believe it was the next morning woke up and she was just , this isn't good. This isn't good. And so she sat me down and said, what I plan to do with my life, 15, I had no idea. And we didn't have a lot of money growing up. I mother worked with two of these jobs and we things were tight. And I told her I tend to go to crime. It seemed  a reason for me to think of doing. , , that's been waiting a lot of money fast. , that was rare pathways, you see. But when I told her that she'd get to crime, I could see tears while I memorized. I tried to sort of backpattern explained that I do sort of white collar, vicking this crime. And then she just left the room just  that. I'd seen him, , until I was 16, I think I'd seen him  this two or three times. I actually remembered looking for him, we were thinking I would see him places, because he had friends and situate in my hometown, but by that point my mother had a warrant on him for, , nine payment of child support. And then when I was 16, he's when. My mother first showed me a letter that he sent. And there's a lot of letters. I spent a couple weeks, a couple of years ago going through all the letters. He sent me pulling it together. And the first letter that I had was for 1976. And I just said, really, it's postmark June 25th, signed dad. And you get to work for getting a date of my birthday. And then one of the lines, and it was, tell me about tell me of yourself and this you both. Until... very soon and shall be known. that soon, very soon, I shall be known. One of the things about my father is that he identifies himself as a writer, as a poet. He has a sense of grandiosity about himself and what his achievements, his place in the world. The often what he would do is he would take a letter from someone else in the Xeroxet and then send it on to someone else. He has a correspondence with Ted Kennedy. He writes them all the time and being a senator, the senator, I think, just as someone who answers the letters form . It'll often be that often hope to just write something maybe it's maybe a couple words and then maybe a zero-ish letter from Ted Kennedy. I have one here, I mean I just got one, actually the most recent, I just got one a couple days ago. Letter from Ted Kennedy, the printed actions are falling apart and the construction is falling. Mr. Flynn, thank you for your recent correspondence and advising me as a further views and critical issues facing us in Congress. There's one they can be in variety. These are some lines from a letter that I received from my colleague in 1995. You must have one love, one great love in our life. We are a nation of crunchers. I fully intend to control Senator Kennedy's reelection. He shall win. And I should be named the head of the American Arts Council. The shall happen. I do hope you both are well in order to some solid pursuits of solid goals in life. In another letter from 1989, I shall be able to do for American now. What Mr. Solge needs to be done for Russia. I work so waiting and shall be soon. And this from 1987. Riders, especially poets, are particularly prone to madness. Whether you  it or not, you are me. the B now tells me you are into drugs. If so, good luck. Cool sage, good luck. I knew we were your heroes. out of federal prisons and I knew he was driving a cab and I think that taxi involved and I knew something about him but I hadn't seen him for 10, 12 years. And we finally did see each other. He had my phone number and at some point I did was in the 1970s he called me up and said he was getting a Vickit from the Greenhouse Museum. Now he's in Guadgame. more of her intake. , you knew I had to pick up trucks and hire and he wanted me to move all this stuff out of the house and out of his apartment. This might have been the first time I ever thought she could. , because when I was a kid, I don't think I talked to her on the men. I got these letters from which I had answered. Yeah, he was used pretty drunk and he called and he said that he was sitting behind this in the shot done, made him from not to turn. He was just gonna , , he wasn't gonna let him take his stuff and he was gonna leave him, but I should get over there. It's actually brought a couple of friends and just for witnesses. And so we got over there, we got there and he was sort of an amazing scene who was, I got to an octopus door and he said to come in, I went in and he was sitting, chin hub naked. He knew of his room, having a, back and drinking vodka out of a silver chalice. And I never seen it before and they just stood up naked in front of me and covered the water. I just stood up. It was shocking. It was shocking to me. I was shocked. It was shocking to me. My friend that I stayed with him for maybe half an hour and I ended up giving him some money, put his stuff in stores, he thought , hire trucking. the hot dinner storage unit did with $50. And then left, and then he moved the stuff out. And then the next time I saw him was maybe a couple months later, he was getting warm on the most sort of one day, maybe April or something. And I was riding my bike along the shelter, and he was seeking a bench, and the Esplanade by the Charles River. And I realized that he was , , at this point you saw him as well. At that point in 1987 I had been working with the homeless, the homeless shelter in Boston for three years. And I also had a sick feeling in my stomach that he would show up at the shelter where I after the seeing him on the event. probably we didn't a month he ended up in shelter one day and after moving walking to the shelter and he announced loudly to everyone that his son worked there and that he needed a bed and that  I'm demanding bed and then I came on to my ship made it up that day and the supervisor took me side and asked him and told him what happened and asked me said that someone had come looking for a bed today that they're changing my father and how is that a shock, it was a secret. I didn't want people to know this. I probably tell people that he'd been prisoned, that he was a writer, , that he was a failed writer. And all of those things seemed actually sort of, , distinct sort of a misty. It was something you could just relate at the good story. But then, , then when it comes almost, it certainly builds up to another level. And I got... I felt real which retold with shame that this man was my father, which was confusing point because I had worked with the homeless for three years and I had a lot of compassion for homeless people. But when it happened to someone in my family, it's happened to my father, I felt other shame that people would look at me in judge being a certain way, whether that I was going to end up  him, that I was crazy,  him, or that why couldn't I help him, why could I do something? Well, that... I was his family, why was I, I lived in space, why did he live in my place? But then , I did not want him to be, , I had to sense that he had, you know, he hadn't really given me much in my life and now he's going to come and take away job I, in some way that I would come to my job and just sort of, , I wish to go anywhere, but rather. You did not write for a while. He would actually, he got a job, he sort of a model, homeless person. He had a day job at a labor pool who would have a bed help for him. By someone else, I didn't have a lot of interaction with him. I remember him being in the lobby of the shelter and him coming in at night. I would have, , radar for when he came in. I would know when he was there, I would look up and see him go and get his bed ticket. Good night. Lead up! probably wouldn't say anything to them. And then I've just sort of see it. And I judge whether you seem drunk or not, whether you seem  it's just going to be a smooth transition from the day into the night. Or if it wasn't, there's going to be a scene. And there were a few times, I remember, , maybe if you're actually after work, I think it's a dawn who's on his way to the labor of this, he worked in the walkie room talking, actually,  outside the shelter. walking along, trying to figure out what was going on in him. And I went back to the shelter recently, this past winter for the first time. And I talked a lot of people who asked them, what they were thinking of this, what how we interact with, what I seemed , what they thought. And most people said that they were just only confused, that they had no idea what to, heart to me, heart to whom. And it seemed to them that I didn't want to talk about it, but it wasn't, , I wouldn't have given away into a conversation about this. See, I was just sort of, we'd two-free-thouard, and I couldn't, I didn't want to say. So I don't know what I was feeling. I think I was feeling awful, I was feeling confused, and it seemed  a nightmare to me. So I don't know what I was feeling. That's how when my father showed up in 1987 in the shelter. I was actively drinking and using drugs. And I, , from what I remember, my drug industry's probably drug intake, I imagine, increased. I had a total three vehicles, . all of them I think drinking drugs was driving. At one point I had a motorcycle accident, I was drunk and he said that he had a motorcycle. And ended up in the hospital in the last spring. But I was drinking and smoke marijuana and pretty much daily. I was sort of feeding a coke bottle of someone who was on the way to some kind of me. I looked at my father for 30 years old and he was identified himself as a writer, I identified myself as a writer. He didn't take it seriously, he didn't take his situation seriously and that maybe I didn't either at that point. How is he able to be perspective by looking at him and I'm not sure why I couldn't get him to start. if I look at it all the other homes, and then I'm drinking it, and then I'm just saying no was tidy. But somehow looking at him and feeling , okay, , I don't know this, him as a father, with some connection to this, and if I keep going  I'm going, I'm going to end up  him, and that's, , terrify. And after you've been there for two years, I ended up getting into therapy and getting sober. , I think it's the next. There's a lot to do with that. It's seen my father, and see what could happen to someone's life. I sort of had to see something that extreme I think, to realize what a potential fate could happen. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. We had it together enough to realize that when he turned 60, who's eligible for senior housing, when he turned 60, he actually got an apartment in subsidized housing, section of housing. And at the end, filming him, probably five years after that, I could move  little for 90s. Because I had learned that the 90s had been there, what would happen? Right now, the look  to lose what track did a shot of mulled life with a knees, and not even higher. I was going to seek out and interview the man that had done my mother, and the man that it, , I've been in my most life for five years or for about a month, and so the first time I really went to look for my father was with a video company, I interviewed him. Every time I go to him, I've been extircled for years, I've been a family, just the stories type on me. io NOEveryone's lead Mary and Illinois, which was built to replace Alcatraz. I mean, I was there. And I had the pleasure of speaking as a source in Asia. I mean, I wanted to look back and I was right about everything in Jesus. A source in East America, jump with everything in Jesus. As well as he and all the CFP called for the birthday of the President. Just a Russian prince. Yeah. Paul Allen, I do was to give me his three-step plan for how to run back. Which seemed to be his... version of bodily advice. We've never spoken before and this is the first real conversation had with him laying out his net that he's probably best. Three steps in the whole program. Step one. Open on a car. Open on a car. He's so equipped with getting steps also. He's involved. Getting someone to steal some checks from insurance company and then. to forge those checks, make a whole series of forge checks, and to open bank accounts, and bank accounts around the country. It was sort of elaborate, elaborate, and contributed, and ultimately, , I failed, I took my step one. I was given  $100 bills, right? But it did be due to a dribbling of the bank, by suitcase, right? The way it was my story. Always a few miles on the bus. Always all the young people. male. My guy is not a gentleman, or myself. When I first met up with him, he went to a soup kitchen where he ate, and I did it in there, and he introduced me to the other people who ate with the people in the soup kitchen. He had known him for years, and he closed the soup kitchen so a time to eat. He just said, this is my son, necklace. He wanted to have you here. Hello, so different. I don't get it. I thought you had somebody picked that by the way, making the documents. He, I can't believe I answered you, I can't believe I answered you. It was a mother. Mother was beautiful. He was so cried that, , this is my son, no one will be here to son and I said, yeah, I was son and and he told me, you can brag to people that I was working at Columbia University. Yeah, what's your name? He's named Walt. Walt, recently, he was a London University. My kid, may I say that? Right? Yeah, right He got right again. There's mother that brings On 35 right yeah, yeah, what's the last time I saw you? How'd you go to that NYU? Yeah, I don't see how long I talk come over How'd you go there? What did you make major writing? Yeah Oh, I was in the middle of the school. A lot of times I'm very frustrated when I go to the meeting, but it's just a simple thing. It tells the same story is over and over again. They seem very disconnected, but there's a few times where I have got some connection. It doesn't seem that he just let his guard down a little bit and let him sort of glimpse at his struggle in some way. And that is... What what  what connects us he actually wrote me letter right after He sent me a couple letters after one of the poems to my The first one Says just says your nick book is a classic love That that was a that's unique letter because Class is only been word that he's ever reserved for his own word Is so pretty to sort of apply that to my It's just sort of him turning even if just for a second, I'm sort of looking at me and saying something about what I've done. It has to be a reason that I've fell down to his letters for all these years. It has to be some sort of reason, something I've actually been waiting for on the before or hoping for. And yeah, something  this is sort of maybe as close as I'll get to it. I would  to have sort of. one of those looks sort of deep connecting moments with him but I'm not really sure if I have a machine that well and I'm not really sure yet I'm actually not even sure at this point I would hope for  maybe  maybe you always hope for you sort of deny that hope for you. I don't know if I can do this. It's all the enough just to  sort of to sit in front of them, go to his room and sit with him for an hour and to see where he is. and tell him, whatever, I'll tell him one thing about myself. If he hears it, that's why it doesn't hear it, that's fine. I don't expect him to give me anything to exploit it. It's always enough just to go and see it. Somehow, calm, it's enough or settled my soul and up, just to go and have some relationship at all. It's just sort of down to sort of real basic, but , strip down to  the most basic father that can be. He just, he just hears my father. He's not there. I can do about that, it's nothing. He can do about that. I go and sit and have a relationship with you personally. Nick Plans, book of poems, is called Summithir, is working on a book and just that.
