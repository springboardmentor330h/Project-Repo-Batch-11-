You've got one on the left and right, you've got the mirror crap, fixing the touchdown on the right. You've got one coming up right behind it about 15 seconds. Behind it, it's a fixed way on the left. It's rush hour here at 5. Plains on every 45 seconds are so good. Two hours, 130 jets, here at the Memphis Hub of Federal Express. It all express. 1.2 million pieces of cargo. Rung loaded, stood down ramps, conveyor belts, scanned, sorted, and re-routed, and re-stand. 8500 people fly to the mountain height. And three hours after this start, packages are packed on, to the destinations, and they are with powder-man's schools. It's great. Lima, somewhere, obviously, hundreds of thousands of Americans won big, big, furry. to get stuff through it's the one time in one day. Middle of the Memphis Airport, the night, we've got one very interesting issue. Everywhere around the Federal Express hub, there are television screens of two times on them. One is the current time. The others, the time, the sort will go down. That is, the time that they hope that they will stop taking in new packages of things then, at which they'll end. Everything goes perfectly. Good weather and amending problems. The sword goes down at 207. And for every minute to go over 207, cost 20 minute. Last hour it was over 100,000. That's in Puyikawa, set to deflates, to get packages where they need to go. Refunds, costumerers, whose packages were delayed. This is the sword point, wait. The final explain this to me, Ron Nichols, 31. And he sits in the hot seat. himself. He is the one. He determines when the sword goes. down. In 5,000 packages is going to be late. Should he hold the sword? How long? In 10 minutes. It's 31-year-old because federal office grass $1 million. He likes the pressure. It's an Irvana almost around $145 to get an ultimate enlightenment because you see everything you see the big picture exactly what's going on everywhere. And as the adrenaline kicks in and you have to make, especially if you're in the hot seat, you have to make that decision as to whether or not you. feel that you're going to make a 207. It is a rush. It's a rush because you year up against the wall, the clock is ticking. And if you make the wrong decision, it's going to cost. One thing that's interesting about the delivery business is that it isn't as people, , who are on the top of the whole operation  this guy who live on the pressure and hit this kind of euphoria. Even even at even at even at the very bottom, you meet people  this. Tabith take. For example, she stands in a row of it doesn't people who do what's called the secondary sword for belt too You can say when you wander around FedEx you're constantly Counseling talking you things  okay, here's the secondary sword and here's what the Here's where the matrix begins. There's the other matrix. , they're all the names of the good things So   the hub and the super hub and the mega hub and the ultra hub Anyway, so have it the teach stands there and she has memorized seven hundred FedEx destination codes I just stand by a pin of patches, did you grab one with a left hand, one with a right? And she barely glances at her, as she, , teaches them, the ten different destinations, so it's faster than you think it's even possible. So what do you think about what you're doing to us? How does this really think about anything? That's just, it's  a float, kind of , really. You don't say you already know where you're going. You don't have to think about it this now. And then I'm able to sort more of that 47 packages per meeting which were required to solve. How many per minute? 47. How many do you sort? 6. And it's sort of a mucher thing, you guys will , , who's faster and who's slower? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Sometimes we try to call people a little bit. Well, for the BB's, Chicago's the smart life my request. And then I program deliveries. For one, speed, a few words from somebody who is, cut you off in traffic and laugh. Back to, do you meet? Should it stray by Juno Dias about delivering cool tables? Back three, the work premier of New Radio drama by David Sidairas. Kind of a radio experiment we gave him a sound effects record and this challenge to create a radio play using only the effects on this one record. And using all the effects. on the record. We hear what he came up with. At four, check out package on that guy, investigation into whether UPS men actually do have sex with the customers on their route. At five, and then happy customer gets to call from the CEO of federal Express and still keeps personal boycott going at the company. Stay with us. on the street as it will be reworked, you must see a lot on your missed place and spend a lot of time basically in your own head and some people  pay good games on the job, they say little challenges themselves and just  there's a euphoria for the people who are under so much pressure at federal express in the middle of the night. There's this euphoria to moving through traffic and racing the clock to get your stuff where it's supposed to go. Tony Starbots delivered produce in San Francisco. At his job he used to wake up 2.30 every morning. It gets downed on the loading duct with the other drivers. Head out. Everybody had their own roots and there were sort of  expected times that you would finish your roots. And part of the reason is why we had so many accidents, especially me, was because I was obsessed with doing my roots faster than anybody else. And I would literally  shave , I think I got up and I first started to shave  how our awesome, . So I'm selling doing it in three hours. two hours. But along the way, , who's  that? People's cars, I wouldn't talk to clients on the draw-haw. Tatars, new trading gauge, new conversation and all, I think about this. You just get the hell out of here. Get on. The way I was shaped at times, I ran a lot of red lights. I would drive 65 miles an hour down of a city street. I got to the point, though, where I realized. that after whatever you're driving that I was getting into increments of life one minute 30 seconds. And literally I would   drive 100 miles in our end of the loading bay slam on the brakes and look at the plot. The number one day, Grime won 50 miles in our street! see it's a two lane one way straight. I'm just seeing the right handling about two blocks ahead. I mean, , just here, non-descript white rental car, this sort of going along and , can't say if they want to go right or left. And two blocks away from them, I go, , if I really wanted to, I could slow down right now because I know they're going to do something really stupid. But then there's this part of it said, help. I'm just I'm on my way back to what I asked you. Of course, as I got with Finland, plenty to do with them straight aside. turned left from the right lane, right in front of me, completely totaled her car. And my first reaction was to get out of the car and I wanted to get it. It wasn't , , you could have prevented this, she saw this coming, but it was , you have lost sleep. And screwed up my whole day. And really, if it wasn't for this group of key gene workers, electrical workers working on the street out there, who saw this and somehow decided that I was in life because I guess it was  this blue collar bond. He's a truck truck. There's no way these people. It's rent-accompanied. And be right, I think I would have wrote down an engine truck because I obviously is speed-managed. And then I sort of  walked through my whole job except the time I ran to the past. You're in this very surreal world. And nobody else is up. You're bombing down the streets. I think that's part of the problem when all Some people here on the streets you're , look, I've been on the streets already for three hours. Just get out of my way I remember one day You knew when the record was but you knew when the record was deep because You would be halfway through your route. Let's say you died at 45 minutes. You knew that you just gave a little You could get some day, but I remember one day  okay, Safway through my room, and there was this woman in front of me at this intersection and The light turned yellow and she liked slow dead and she really took us to the Lighthouse with the perfect and I  had all the lights time and She slowed down and I was sitting in my trunk and I lost it and I lost it to the point where Before the light turned green I  what? track, right,  put it in neutral, it's on a slightly more  this sort of pump. And then immediately, the minute I pump for, it's , , it's , this huge deal washed over me and I'm , okay. That was , that was flat. Okay, it's one thing to be screaming in the yelling near your truck listening to light. , motorhead. It's another thing to physically fire on. So then I realized, okay, I crossed, some line that, , okay. I guess you just shouldn't draw us. What basically happens in psychology, I think, in the beginning, for whatever is that. Good job is so... What? I mean, and it's stressful. There's no more stressful job in drawing. Especially in urban environments. And... So then it all gets reduced to the new shi That's reduced to the sky using this little car headie You can even  somehow become your arching And so it just creates an environment where you get very hostile and you just, , everybody is in the easy And all you want to do is get the point Then there is brother One part of the library job, which was always, , there you are, you're screaming, yelling, or you're just , keep going. Just , how does it go? And then, here's the beautiful secretary walking to work, short-scircuit. It would be  this,  all the noise would stop. You just have  this momentary, come, and then all of a sudden, she would disappear from the beginning and move the flashlight back to, , to crazy traffic. Try it, , where you're going. That would always save you. But thanks to the great pleasure of being here to visit Prince Chip, who wasundo from Ugly Woods. 隨thock, who we met. A haw's dear birds torched at. A storm came into search for ape lettuce. On our gorgeous land, on sunny days, on rainy days, our paper boy comes by. He never, never misses us, cause if he did I try. Now, why don't we all try it together? Ready? One, two, three, the paper boy comes by. Act two, be me. This is the end you plan your head when you work. And there are also the words that your job takes you into, as you go house. to pass the past times, to stop, having little encounters with people around the way as a delivery person. This short story is by Juno Diaz that guy is who do with the gold crowns and bristels and shelkeys and tapes. A winning before we start that some of the language in this story might not be suitable for the get-in the same way. The first time we try to deliver the gold crown the lights on in the house but no one lets us in, I bang on the front door and Wayne hits the back and I can hear our double drum shaking the wood. windows. Right then I have this feeling of someone's inside, laughing at us. This guy better have a good excuse when he says, this is bullf**k. You're telling me I say, or Wayne's the one who takes his job too seriously. He pounds some more on the door, his face jiggling. A couple of times he wraps on the windows, tries to get into the curtains. I take a more philosophical approach. I walk over the ditch of the connects to the road, draining. which pipe half filled with water and sit down. I smoke and watch a mama duck near three duckling scapets the grassy bank and then flow down stream around the same string. Beautiful, I say, but Wayne doesn't hear. He's banging on the door with the staple gun. At nine Wayne picks me up at the showroom. And by then I have a route planned in. The order form tells me everything I need to know about the customers will be dealing with that day. If someone is just getting a 52 inch hard table delivered, then  they aren't going to give you too much hassle, but they also aren't going to take. Those are your spots with cerebral and pre-thamboid to lift these. The full tables go north to the rich suburbs, Livingston, Ridgewood, Bedminton. You should see our customers. Doctors, diplomats, surgeons, presidents of universities, ladies. slacks and silk tops who sport thin watches and retreating for a car. Most of them prepare for us by laying down a path of yesterday's lost and post on the front door to the game room. I make them pick it all up. I say, got ah-ho, what if we slip? Do  what 200 pounds of slate do to a floor? Threat of property damage puts the chop chop in this step. Sometimes the customer has suggested a store for a cafe or a newspaper while we're in the middle of the job. I'm sure you'll be all right they say. They never sound too sure. Of course I say, to show us where the silver's at. The customers ha ha and we ha ha and then they agonize over leaving. Lingra bought a fund door trying to memorize everything they own as if they don't know where to find us, who we work for. Once they're gone, I don't have to worry about anyone bothering me. I put down the ratchet, crack my knuckles, and it's splur. Usually while Wayne is smoothing up the felt and doesn't need help. I take cookies from the kitchen, raises from the bathroom cabinets, some of these houses have 20 to 30 rooms. On the ride back, I try to figure out how much loot if it takes to fill up all that space. I've been called roaming around plenty of times, but you'd be surprised how quickly someone believes you're looking for the bathroom. If you don't jump when you discover. If you just say hi, after the paperwork's been signed, I have a decision to make. The customer has been good, and tip well, we call it even leave. The customer has been in ass, maybe the yelled, maybe the letter kids through golf balls out of us, asked for the bathroom. When will pretend that he hasn't seen this before? Excuse me, I'll say. I let them show me the way to the bathroom usually are already know, and once the door is shut in trouble, that's right. into my pockets and throw a fist-sized, wide, twirler paper and twirl it. I take the dump if I can and leave that for him. Most of the time, Wayne and I work well together, he's the driver in the money man and I do the lifting handle the ass. Tonight, I want to wait a long still and he wants to talk to me about Charlene, one of the showroom girls. I haven't wanted to talk about women. months, not since the girlfriend. I really want to pilot he tells me. Maybe I'm one of the maddisons. Man, I say, cutting my eyes towards him, don't you have a wife or something? He gets quiet. Twice this year, Wayne's cheated on his wife, and I've heard it all before and after. The last time his wife nearly tosses as out to the dogs. Neither of the women seemed worth it to me. One of them was even younger than Charlie. Wayne can be a movie guy. And this is one of those nights. These slouchers in the driver's seat, and swore it's from traffic, riding other people with bumpers  I've told him not to do. I don't need a collision for a four hour silent treatment. So I try to forget that I think his wife is good people, and asking the Charlene's given him any signals. This is the truck down. Signals  he wouldn't believe, he says. The second time we bring the gold crown, the heavy curtain next to the door swims up by the Spanish fan. A woman stares at me and wanes too busy knocking to see. Muñeca, I say. She's black and unsmiling, and then the curtain drops between us. A whisper on the glass. She had on a t-shirt that said no problem, and didn't look  she owned the place. She looked more  the hell. He couldn't have been older than 20, and from the thinness of a face I pictured the rest of her skin. We stared at each other for a second at the most, not enough for me to notice the shape of her ears, where her lips were chopped. I've fallen in love on less. Later in the truck, in the way back to the showroom, Wayne Mudders, this guy is dead. I'm mean. The girlfriend calls sometimes but not often. She was found herself in New Boydman, some son-in-oh who works at a record store. Dan is his name, and the way she says it, so painfully ghing go, makes the corner of my eyes narrow. The last time I saw her in person was in Hoboken. She was with Dan, and had me told me about him, and her really crossed the street and her high-pods to avoid me in my boys. A month before the song and all, I went to her house in front of the street. the friend and her parents asked me how business was as if I balanced the books or something. Business is outstanding, isn't it? That's really wonderful to hear, if I was said, you betcha. He asked me to help him mo his lawn, and while we were dribbling gas into the tank, he offered me a job. A real one that you can build on. Utilities he said is nothing to be ashamed of. The boss nearly kicked out asses over the gold crown. The customer and asked him to prove it called up crazy, said we were delinquent. That's how the boss quit it. Delinquent. We knew that's what the customer called us because the boss doesn't use words  them. Look, boss, I said, we not  crazy. I mean, we not  federal marches,  Paul Bunnan. The boss wasn't happy. He tore us for a good two minutes and then dismissed us. For most of the night I didn't think I had a job, so I hit the bars, fantasizing that I would bump into this cabron, how would that black woman while me and my boys cracked, but the next morning Wayne came by with the cold crown again. Both of us had hangovers. One more time to said, an extra delivery no overtime. We hammered on the door for ten minutes, but no one answered. I jimmed with the window in the back. door and I could have sworn I heard her behind the patio door. I knocked hard and heard footsteps. We called the boss and told him what was what and the boss called the house but no one answered. Okay the boss said, get those card tables done. That night was we lined up the next days paperwork, we got a call from crew it and he didn't use the word delinquent. Crew it said he was contrite and determined and asked us to come again. His maid was sure to let us in. We park in front of crew at the house of Bang and the door. I give Wayne a hard look when I see no calm and garage. Yes, I hear a voice inside say, where the delivery guy's out, . Both slides, a lock turns the door opens. She stands in our way, wearing black shorts and gloves and red on the lips, and I'm sweating. Yes, she stands back from the door holding it open. Sounds  Spanish when he says, No, I'm gonna say, switching over. Do you remember me? No, she says, I look over at Wayne. Can you believe this? I can believe anything kid. You heard us, didn't you? The other day, that was you. She shrugs and opens the door wider. You better tell her to prop that with a chair. Wayne heads back to unlock the truck. You hold that door, I say. She stays in the kitchen while we work. I can hear her humming. Wayne shaking his right hand  he's called it as fingertips. Yeah, she's fine. She has her back to me, her hands turn around and the first thing when I walk in. I try to sound conciliatory. You're from the city. I'm not. We're about. What? Washington Heights, Dominicana, I say, Kikayana, she knots, what street? I don't know the address she says. I have a written down, my mother and my brothers live there. I'm Dominican, I say. You don't look in. I get a glass of water for both staring out at the muddy lawn. She says, I didn't answer the door because I wanted to make him mad. Make who mad? I want to get out of here, she says. out of here, I'll pay you for a ride. I don't think so, I say. Aren't you from Nueva York? No. Then why did you ask to you dress? Why? Have family near them? Would it be that big of a problem? I say in English that she should have her boss bring her. But she stares at me blankly. I switch over. He's up in the day, well she says. Suddenly angry. I put down the glass. Move next to her to wash it. She's exactly my height and smells of liquid detergent and has tiny, beautiful mulls on her neck. Here she says, putting out her hand, but I finish it and go back to the den. Do  what she wants is to do I say to Wayne? Wayne is sinking the bolts into the slate with the micita. You can't do what he says. Why not? Kid, we have to finish it. this. I'll be back before  it. Quick trip in, out. Kid. He stands up slowly. He's nearly twice as old as me. I go to the window and look out. New Ginkpo standing rose beside the driveway. A thousand years ago when I was still in college, I learned something about them. Living fossils, unchanged his their inception, millions of years ago. The taxi I leaned in knew. Sure did. He answers. take the truck keys out of the toolbox. I'll be right back, I promise. We reached the Washington Bridge without saying a word. This is the best way she asked. The bridge doesn't seem to impress her. It's the shortest way. That's what he said when I arrived last year. I wanted to see the countryside. There was too much rain to see anything anyone wants? I want to ask her if she loves her boss, but I ask her instead, how do you the states? She swings her head across the billboards, I'm not surprised by any of it she says. As we cross over the bridge I drop my hand into her lap. I leave it there, palm up, fingers slightly curled. Sometimes you just have to try, even if  it won't work. She turns her head slowly, facing out beyond the bridge cables, out to my hand and in the hut. him. Everything he watched me heighted the vanicine. You can't fall blocked at our past and you can stay a bakery or you can stay a super McDonald or a hotel he's staying at. If I would have parked a truck and get out, nobody would take me for delivery now. I could be the guy who's on the corner selling the vanicine flag. I could be on my way home to my girl. When we reach her block, I ask if kid was a sack. the building. Any points out the stupids' paintings. She gets out of the truck and straightens the front of her sweatshirt before following the lines that his finger has cut across the street. We that they are saying. Wayne works on the boss and a week later on back on probation paining the warehouse. Wayne brings me a meatball sandwich is from Adam the Road. Skinny things with a seamer. cheese coming bread. Was it worth it he asked me? He's watching me close. I tell him it wasn't. Did you at least get some? Hell yeah I say. You sure? Why would I lie about something  that? Home girl was an animal. I still have the teeth marks. Damn he says. We're back on the road a week later. Buckingham's and Perials, Gold crowns, and does in the part tables. I keep a copy of Pooch's paperwork, and when the curiosity finally gets to me on call, the first time I get to machine, the next two times I'm in the bed minister area. Pooch picks up and says yes, but on the fourth time she answers, and the sink is running on her side of the phone, and she shuts it off when I don't say anything. What she there way nasty in the truck? Of course she was. He hands me the map and my fingers trace our deliveries, stitching city to city. Looks  we've gotten everything I say. Finally, Yons, what's first tomorrow? We won't really know until morning, but I've gotten the paperwork in order. But I take guesses anyway. One of our games, it passes the time, gives us something to look forward to. I close my eyes and put my hand down on the map. So many towns, so many cities, choose from. Some places are sure bets, but more than once I've gone for a long shot, been right. You can't imagine how many times I've been right. But this time nothing comes. No magic, no nothing. It could be anywhere. I open my eyes and see that Wayne is still waiting. Edison, I say, pressing my thumb down. Edison, New Jersey. Juno DS is story Edison New Jersey, this is what we're trying. Coming up, David Sidderis tries something, none of us has ever heard anybody try. The real power of the UPS uniform and more. It's in a minute. Good job, Ianization. This is American Life America's. We'll meet with our program of course, which is a theme in quite a wide variety of. the writers, the folders, and the formers to take a whack at that theme. Radio Monovogs, documentaries, short fiction and occasionally short radio drums. Our program today is called Deliveries, Battle of Riz, and we've arrived at Act 3. We're a premier. Hey, what's it, Riz? It's a 3-configuratory program, author of the new book of stories called Naked, Occasional Commentator and Enquirer's Mom Edition. And a few weeks ago we gave him this assignment. To write a radio play using only the sound effects from one sound effects record. and he addues every single word somewhere in the drama. He accepted the challenge. Which was as our sound effects record. This volume I hold in my hand. It is called ultimate sound effects. Over one hour because that is part of the time. Volume 5, CD 8093-2, controls the label. The effects on here so you can find the challenge that face the playwright. The water on the CDN way are, of course, during Carrage on Street, swamp noises. Time bomb through airport security. , you see that on a CD record, and you wonder, how much call is there for something this in our radio production world? Steam trains at T-T station, exterior airport, construction site, bowling out, jet takes off, native Americans dance. busy harbor animals, riverside, big cats, old clock, charms, car accident. five minute war baronyard sounds workshop eviary and the sound of a beating human part we asked the adults to keep play short possibly the hardest part of the assignment when we were done I read them  the list of effects of the phone and and he took his part of the assignment here site to do them exactly they ordered that they appear on the CD Here is the work for me on the video. I remember it was a late Sunday afternoon in Cliff and I were taking a handsome cab through the heart of good time square That's the charm of Empire City. You hold out your hand and hail a horse-grown carriage Just  in the days of glory. We  to drive in every weekend from half the group to taking the sun I  it for the father who crowds the smell of roasting any and I  it for the salt Salting those peaks, splash shows on the great white wing. We sure do love those shows. I remembered we just come from a bad name before it's a pulse that you'll use a call about the Medicare debate. So it was spectacular. The castoos and the dancing. The chorus line on their walkers with the IV stands. God, I love that show. We bought a few dozen scolding pretzels from the passing snack cart. Settled into the backseat while horse-drawn carriage. And they just started rehashing the show when that witch appeared. The wasn't a witch and they're shewes a t- A tattoo artist with a particularly offensive message extinture her forehead. The strange thing, the unusual thing was that she knocked on the door of our carriage and handed us a simple plastic tail containing a human heart. Now that was an eye. The girl said that it had been her mother's heart and that she desperately needed to have a dilemma to Clyde'sdale where her brother was a weightless transplant. And Clyde'sdale that was out of state, not far from house over. She'd intended to deliver herself. but then something came up. A date. She'd been invited to a beer blast by a man with a Caesar haircut. I  a Caesar. Me, I thought of a soft sort of scared. I've read about things  this in the papers. A couple comes to town to take a show and the next thing , someone's handing them an organ picking all the salt off their pretzels. It's the oldest story in the book. But then she didn't do a pop and pulled out two tickets for sublet and what could we say? That's the hottest show in town. Nobody can stick his to that. So we... said, sure we'll do the video of Mars hot to your sick brother and plot sale. Because it seemed  the right thing to do. That made performance, Fart Rosees. So, all we went, our rascal was in the parking lot, ten locks away, but the track was an absolute tangle, and it would have taken hours to reach. I had the carriage driver, take us to the river, where we could have one of those medical waste barges, carriers to the other side. The view was remarkable. Sky, color for session. We were in heaven, absolutely heaven, until the barge driver let us off in. What do you call a place  that? Swah, they'd call it a swah. I lost my good husband's skin evening pumps in the cup, but what did I care? I just grabbed the heart, blackened out a passing car, and demanded a ride to the airport. Even there for the hungry on my feet. I'll give you an A. We arrived at the terminal where we booked a beautiful night to Clydesdale. Quick bag is salted on your skins and the captain's lounge and then wouldn't  it? A bomb, a bomb in the airport met a detector. All flights had to. So I mind was racing. But not as fast as mine. Taxi, I held it half to the nearest station. It wasn't that far behind, but wouldn't , it's son of a bitching G.D. train pulled out just as we were flying sack of salt and porcelain marks. You were flying porcelain marks. All right, but I got this for the boat. And paid with large field, big man. You just had to flash your money around didn't you? It's their job to make change. It's not my fault, guy couldn't break a system. He were trying to impress him as much we're trying to do. We were having this exact same argument when I noticed. I noticed the crew well. Construction workers building a Ferris wheel the far side of the station. He noticed them only because they noticed me I'm an absolute magnet for cat calls. That's the cause of being an attractive woman I approach the four-clifed operator a man named Carl and we had a little talk Monotamono. Oh, I  that Carl after explaining the business card He offered us the services of his brother who worked that far away in one of the neighboring mountains. So we get to this place where Carl's brother works and it turns out that the guy polishes balls. In a bowling house. Pins and needles of this call because there's a main thing, or an observation, a solid wall, and a sweater. I love it. the field place, frostbored. What was the set of brains that calls brother to be laid off just ten minutes before we arrived. He'd taken his car and headed west. Just  that. Well we in a binder what? The assistant manager of the snack bar offered us a lift as far as the neighboring airfield. Then I took her up on it because- A truck is what she was. Hey now. Not flush on her cheeks to cover her mood. And that business about the airfield, it wasn't an airfield but a- Military base, you saw them soldiers, prancing behind that pork grrr fence. Girl, drop the sock and throw the way laughing because that's what boys do. She was a prostitute. She was a trolla. All in what you will, couldn't really cover whatever your bethose is. Indies. That's what they were. They were really. Native Americans. Higher tribe of loneliness chances Arm st caps. Sermon army, supply them and shoot. very fast. Not far from the run. It was  seeing a bit splashy music. Except that there were no rushes. Followed in a little rich, they were scheduled for the board of one of those gambling, and then straight enough rivered to where else could collide. They all could have lived if we helped them pack up their Tom Tom, so we made a few quick trips back and forth to the casino port. Once the book got on the way, I brought myself a bucket of sausage cones and took a seat on the outside machine. It's still night, and I'll be sneaking, and see the eyes and the machines watching the things. You immediately danced into my hair, so I went down below dead where they keep. Well, that's where they... keep the big cast! Showcats! I stood up close to the bars where I could feel our slots breath against my face. It was hip-knocked, his wife was. Which lost arms, super befriended, this way? It's a big clock struck, and gambling raf pulled into court timber to stock up our poachings. Captain said he'd be docked for an hour and more, but as human heart, we just couldn't wait them. We jumped shipping rent in the car. Captain is unusually heavy for a Sunday night at 3am, so I let him do the driving. Was making decent time until a cola tanker swirled into the opposite length, everything. Dear God, what a mess! Those who weren't maimed or crippled, rushed from their cars with hands and cappacops is trying to scoop up as much free coke. The tanker driver opened fire on the crowd and a few people shot back. Next, no. All hell broke this. Why at police, the national guard, two or three dozen private policemen, they were all over the place. We left the rental car and fled to a passenger toward a neighboring bar. My idea because I  barons. I'm a barn person. I can't stand them things because I'm not a barn person. Straw makes me anxious and I was nervous. I'm not having a dodge on that gunfire. We were all pretty shaken up, Linda, myself, around this human heartbeat. I'm not ears, besides the pain left. Oh, no. I figured that after everything it had been through, the poor thing had suffered a lot of attack. There's a lot of it. Please. I tried frightening you to get the heartbeat up. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh. And that's the work. Once he stopped the street, I heard in distance sound. How it was, it was coming from a shed beside the farmhouse. Hello, we're here in the barn with a human eye. It was a farmer building in an aviary. That's a place with birds again. That is birds, it's warming. I'm really through the house. I sat back for a moment before I thought... Hmm... It's... It's not bad. Not bad. Oh, it was brilliant, is what it was. We tied the human heart to the foot of a carrier pigeon, take the address to a ski, and send it on its way. Lye away, little pigeon. Lye away to Clydesdale Memorial Hospital. Bye! Lye away to Clydesdale Memorial Hospital. Lye away to Clydesdale Memorial Hospital. I guess you found her way because today's later we received our tickets just as promised. Run from seats to the map-nap performance of something. The hottest show in town. Where do we tuck the play-dills into my person? Just  always, we hail the handsome pound. Ehh! Ehh! No, I hand some cam. No, I'm some cam. That's it. We settled into the back seat and dropped off our memories. Until that bearded coupe dog of door carrying a lot in a sauce. All right, a time square by David Sedaris, formed by Toby Warrie and Pneumty Boyer. All right, let's sing about the breadman together, shall we? Good. Here's a song about all friends, the breadman. O, he drives a safe white wagon where he comes, before he drives a safe white wagon where he comes, when he comes, when he comes, he's got bread and kitchen, cooked, he's got bread and kitchen, cooked, he's still breathing in the same stew, when he comes, he's got pulled. Accord. Check out packaging at home. A not terribly recent article at Wall Street Journal asserts that an inward knit number women have fantasies about their UPS delivering. 13 reference to that calendar's names  funds, UPS. It's part of UPS' marketing campaigns, UPS commercial that she's been swooning over to UPS guy. One reporter actually caught five therapists for her clients who fantasized about UPS. So, R UPS rooms, actually, rolling guns in the city. Do the drivers actually get to play out of this TLP TAL. See that's what we call it around there. That's what we call it around here. American life. This American life could be a currency update. When outside UPS funding. It turns out that asking UPS drivers whether they have sex on their route is pretty much  asking any other group of mostly straight men about sex. Very quickly you find yourself talking about an elevator, a mirror, or a nymphominiac. A girl in the company that was moving I obviously had the hats for this gentleman and confronted him in the elevator and told a mat on the chair. We'll see we'll get original! in front of her, but she would have a one of your doors right behind her. And you could see nothing but her real, I mean, every child that I know I'm going to not say names, but he had a building route and there was a, , an infomaniac in the building and she'd come down. And so I took to 15 men in two hours as they were leaving their UPS jobs at the end of the day. Some were funny, some were hot, some were stupid. The majority were in their late 20s or their 30s, mostly black. And I believe I now have the empirical evidence necessary to put everyone's mind at rest. here. UPSLIFRIGYES AS A GRoup ARE NOT HAPPING MORE SEX NEWER. Here's how I know. When you ask them what sexual experiences they have personally had while on the job. You instantly get into really boring territory. Before I got married, there was a situation where I had conversation with a woman and it just just clicked and very well. It always happened, I guess. The pipes were there, everything was right, but nothing happened. That thing happened. Let's try another guy. No, I had one closing counter, I'd do it with a package to place in Derbord Park here. And it was in the morning, 10 left the clock and girl came down. The woman was, I don't know, she looked at her 20s. She came down in a laundry room. She answered the door. She's in her. to launch your ring at the door. What happens? I kind of rolled my eyes to the pet as I have to go. Yeah, to go. How about this guy? What's the most outrageous proposition you ever had? Can I come back ask the word, , make love to? You ever do it? No. They don't do it. Not at work. A 15 guys, not one, but we really told me about a sexual encounter yet, I'm a child. And they were streaming themselves to the exact same boring reasons you do. It'll lose the job, airy. We usually don't have time to us, , as far as Echoes. Yes, I have time. So I'll pass. I'm in a rush. A few guys said they heard. Other guys having sex on their first. And weirdly, the setting for these events is always the same. He, , invited her own patrol. Yeah, in the traffic. In the back of the package, the traffic is exactly the worst. I'm out paying going on the sale. On the shelves. It springs me to a question. Who are all these people that other people know who  having sex in these places that sound so uncomfortable? I imagine a lot of women would  to see the inside of a bank at the car right now. I've heard drivers say let's just throw some envelopes down here on the floor and you can have. Happen always happens in the van. I've never heard people , oh no. Where the guy comes in. into the house. It's always the one going to be. I don't know. You're not when you go into a building. I do not  going into a building because you never know what situation you're going to run into. It could be a crazy old lady who says next thing, , something's missing from the apartment. There could be some frustrated woman who can walk in to her apartment and she says she could say you tried making advances in her. That sexual harassment here out of a job. You don't want to be in that situation. You just can have to anything for you to bake you up. , if it's a... I mean, climbing into a vehicle that's definitely essential. The bottom line about the whole UPS sex connection, what actually happens to real people, and this is going to blow your mind. Is it sometimes women ask their UPS men out on the date? Off-hours, let's have lunch, let's have dinner, regular kind of date. Just  you and me. Aside from that, very few exceptions, I believe it is all simply ice. Oh yeah, it comes with a little hot time. It's got a shower, had a gown, gown, all. And then it just opened up the oops. This is happening. Oh yeah. You might get that shower and you might, you might, you might. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. That has happened to you. Right. That's it. Time is my girl. I'm scared. Well, I had to be strong for my woman The girls, they love to see you It's just a love man, it's you and one I love man, it's you and one I love man, it's you and one I've got a guy, I've got a guy I love that man, it's you and one I love to meet you and one Well I promised to do today by at least be low myself. Good job anyway. Marguerock on Special thanks today to Christina Stevens John Conner's saturday, Chris Lee again and David Greenfield.
