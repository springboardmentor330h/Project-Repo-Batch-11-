Now, you better explain for our radio listeners in what context you actually sat in front of your radio mic. Well, it was... Around 1955 or 1956, when I graduated from Maryland, instead of getting an honest job, I worked radio. So if you're a user, here's a table where we send about back in 1956 on the radio. Please don't play. This is three years before I was born. And you're just, you're just a kid and it's put in your 23 years ago. The personal problem and worries happened down. Are you disturbed by business problems, now it's problems or emotional problems? See, this is... You need to identify this. This is very formally with you. It's really an answer. It's all your questions which are one dollar and you're much better. How could somebody that how could somebody who's charging a dollar for a reading even afford to buy a radio at? Well, look, she's been to the European education higher. This or what? They must have taught her something over there. So now at some point you gave up your career, your burgeoning career and radio really deployed to the top grand. That was because... It was nothing important, something called makeover. Great, it's an airy certified company. Now, for me, let me give a little explanation of Tertigrish show for this. Each week in our program, we document stories of life in the Internet of States using all the tools, radio storytelling, documentaries, monologues, towns, gates, anything we can think of. And today, the Father's Day, my own father, very glass certified company, now that is real That is real. kick. Say, well, this is a little father's day adventure together. You could have bought it at times. I've never heard of it before. Head of what? Why did you double it? Our program today will have four rounds. And one, Sandra Singh Lowe finds out, where all the seas are bothered. Very differently, in the way she sees him. Back to Dad's music. Straight. right here, Sherman, Lexi. Back three, the moment that left. Back four, reconciling. Story from the right. Oh, oh, hi. So that takes us to act one, wait for us? Act one, how the world sees you, or fun? So that our first story today is from Los Angeles. Sandra Singler, I was just saying, getting a show in Billboard. When she was growing up, her father was not a fun dad. He himself had been working in Shanghai in 2012. He was raised in the company. Because of that, it's just, as many countries as need to have surprised me. They didn't celebrate Christmas, never took his children to Disneyland. No, it was less than an hour away from their home. No real vacations. Sandra tells the story, once she bought a book of Charlie Brown comics. for a dollar in her pair, and her father grew the cross-loom, yourias at the ship, waste money. He was a star. But a Sandra found out recently. Not everyone in the world sees her father the way she does. There's a kind of news that you're never prepared for. And here last week was mine. A friend told me that, incredibly, a local grunge band had composed a rock anthem about my dad and his performing it, the great response in Malibu area. at clubs. The group in question was called Boy Hits' car and the saw, a wailing rock creed occur powered by a full jam- riffs, was in fact called Mr. Low. The actual cover of the Boy Hits' car demo tape was a granally zeroct photo of a tiny was in 70-saterial Chinese man grinning on a malibu beach in Tattard swim trucks, which was indeed my father. I have to admit, however, that the Mr. Low in the song was not what I was familiar As seen through the eyes of lifeguard's last singer Craig Wondell, Mr. Low is a mystical dreamy figure who swims naked among the dolphins. In the duality the characterizes certain types of rock poetry. I reminded of the doors. The natural dance Mr. Low does on the beach brings the listener comfort while at the same time posts of profound spiritual challenge. the same. My first instinct was to have to be a sick Freudian joke one of my siblings was playing on me. As in, what is the most wildly unlikely most brought with amazing priorities? Was wacky, 60s, Peter Sellershell, then you can imagine good hair. to our family. But no. My father was these Malibu surfers eggman. He was their walrus. I decided to meet them. Craig Lundell, based player Scott Menville, guitarist Louis Lundard were all too happy to come into a studio and explain how they're sawing. It was one day to be... I mean there's about five of us just sitting in the sand and talking. Mr. Lowe can totally walk me up and... I'm just standing there for just in three seconds. and say anything. Then said, , victims of modern technology. , my start to think has, I'm just thinking, then start to talk to us, saying, you have a conversation with such singing. So that's where the song, the Krebs from. And then said, , when the people say to me, you have a conversation. You remember when you first saw my father? I remember these guys probably have really many of them. But it was in 1978. I couldn't be fired in. Our house burned down and we moved to my west. And I remember seeing Mr. Load stretching naked. And then taking shower. outside naked and at the beach at the beach. And I thought it was kind of ,  not in the bathroom, I thought it was interesting. That was my personal book. Okay. I too had similar memories. Ever since I've been at that beach malice since I was five, six, seven years old, I was down there and I noticed some of you were in summer's office, I heard you were in head to home, well, so we're naked as well. So we're talking to these guys. It suddenly occurred to me. who my dad really is. how every neighborhood has its eccentric for cat lady, parent man, guy with the umbrella hat, recycling cart who yells, well, in my southern California hometown, Malibu West, my dad is that person. So, unsettling thing to realize about one of your parents. And behind rehearsal of that, , is the naked instinct. I'm sorry. For years, I didn't even know what's hey, I just thought you'd be making a mistake. It's a song, what do you mean? It's a song, what do you mean? No. Wait, there's a naked handstand. Yes, of course, there's a naked handstand man's song. Unbelievably, Mr. Lovesot made the court was only the latest in a decking block aesthetic exploration of my father and the part of boy gets carbases the Scott Mench. I was walking down beach one day. I invited my father to join me in the band at the studio. He just really see all the fast that he's naked. For them for you, stamp, and stamp for you, the rest of which I will ditch. In a maze, swimming pool, everybody. Because that's most hygienic, most clean, food to do. But if some young people want to see his naked, this is symbol of something more important, well, I thought it's happy to be a service. The way I discovered his naked was this. One day, maybe a couple months ago, I reached out. And a couple, yeah, man. this is Mr. Low, we hear that kid about you in a sun. Oh I see those raspberries they didn't have the money and it's nice I'm very happy I've been on it probably if they don't write in a sunbomb me probably nobody will ever write about me so this is my life yes that's not true because I've made my career writing about you now so I see you on the writing so I appreciate that too. But you're  something different, that's that very precious for me. Of course, we don't do respect to the members of Boy Kids Park. In my opinion, my father's least likely candidate comes symbol of individual freedom, a spiritual introspection, of the healing powers nature . After all, this is man who believed all three of his children should get PhDs in engineering, or else they would start in the street. Then again, all these things may be a mess. a personal interpretation. So you see my father's nakedness is kind of a rebellion of some sort or no, not actually, I guess so. Yeah, just you see that the ability to go beyond the general stereotype that a man can hold in that regard and it's free. Contact with nature. That's very important. Not in the society, you're so silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, savage time. You're going to talk to yourself or to the village. Nature, but did you all incur unnecessary memories of your memories? If you encourage us to do that. Oh yeah. Okay, when we do many things, we always go along the zoomar beach to the garbage can. To collect those aluminum cans, and we can't peek away the pandemates fan. , I have to go instead. Not to put too fine at point on it, but a competition to collect cans for spare change. It's not the sort of... meaning with nature, say, while Whitman and Ralph Waldo emers an ex-tall, which brings me to another point. I have to say, there is something sort of pointy and developed sitting in a room full of young people who are hanging onto my father's every word. He's  an odd little guru, they his apostles. God knows he never got that my sister'd brother on me. At one point, for reasons too complicated to explain here, my father's saying the boys in the van, the Chinese folks that he had translated. French. Ah, maybe it won't change. Yeah, I know. Whee! Were you crying? I must say that tears were coming. Why? Why? Why? I was beautiful. I was just... I'm gonna do a true expression of something. I just felt my story. Just came here too. Where's the end of the room? Why not? Sing another one. If this makes... my father happy? Well then I guess I'll try to be happy for him. Okay, why do you keep the back of it? Sandra Singlow is a writer, former, composer and columns, Buzz Magazine and Los Angeles. She's the author of the book, that takes a holiday, essays from lesser Los Angeles. She tells stories about her father and one woman show called, Aliens and Amaric. It opens June 26th, second stage New York City. Yeah, I am so glad to be here. Hey, Doug,  one of the things you often find through that about stories, , a couple of videos that is after too long, how are we doing so far? How long was that story? , the total story is that it will got 11 minutes. That's a pretty long piece. Too long, do you think? Yeah, I think the students did your interest in flag? No, my interest in slow down, however, if fiber listening to the show at home. with other distractions ... ...  all. Okay. That is time to open a back to. Back to father's music. If for this act, they ask you to bring in an example of the kinds of music. that you, my father, play around the house when I was kid. Because you had me as a guy, whenever you were home, weekends. Absolutely. So what did you bring in? Well, I brought three pranks and other CDs right on. Kim, can you just choose a song? And let's pop that on? Sure. What have you got? Probably my favorite pranks and other song, ladies and trim. Why is this your favorite? I don't know, I just  rhythm,  pranks. crazy. Oh dad this really swings. She gets to hungry. She likes the dinner and never come play. Are you remember the 60th birthday party? Yes it's a play. Right where we had data when people see vaccinate regenerate,�ation wave. This is he's saying he's sitting there. They're pretty good job. Doesn't  crap games with parents or... Won't go to Harlem. Wait, thank you. It's a great song. This next story that we're going through is right in the Sherman-O-Laxi. Those haven't West Coast. And among other things, it's about his father and his father's name, and that they're not. It's not, it's how there's a, I guess, of the gun. So it's not ladies to try. No, this story is called, because my father always said, he was the only Indian. He's our Jimmy Hendrix play, the star-spangled banner at Woodstock. During the 60s, my father was the perfect hippies, and something he'd be returning to be Indians in the Indian. But because of that. My father was always asking me. How does anybody recognize when an Indian's trying to meet the social state? Just proof or evidence? Back during the Vietnam War, my father was at one of those demonstrations against him. Yeah, there's a photograph of my father demonstrating his spoke hand during that Vietnam War. The photograph made it under the wire service and frequented newspapers throughout the country, it even made it under the upper eye magazine. And in the photograph, my father is wearing the herbald. flowered shirt, he's got red t-symbol splash-tonies cheeks  warp-aid and he's looking  a hip or an indie. And in his hands he's holding the same 16 rifle and he's photographed captures him in that moment just before he proceeds to beat the crap that of a national guard to drive his line. Oh, and the speed. To fellow demonstrator holds a sign that is just barely visible over my father's left shoulder. It red, make love, not war. That photographer won the Pulitzer Prize and editors across the country. We had a lot of fun creating caption in the headlines. I read a lot of them collected in my father's scrapbook, but my favorite was run into Seattle times. The caption under the photograph read, Demonstrator goes to war for peace. Anyways, my father was arrested. But he got lucky. At first, they charged him with a tempted murder, but they played bargain that down. They were sought with a deadly weapon. And then they played bargain that down to being Indian. On the other hand, we got two years spent in law. all of a state pen and pinched. ? My father made it through those two years of prison. You never got into any serious. So somehow I voted rape and got at a prison just in time to hit chocolate woodstock to watch Jimmy Hendrix by the star-spangled banner. After how the f***ed I've been through my father's set. I take your Jimmy. Must've known I was there in the crowd. I said, I'm  that. Twenty years later, my father played his Jimmy Hendrix tape and told it, wore down. Nobler and over the house still that the rock was red glare and the bombs bursting in there. He'd sit by the stereo with a cooler of beer beside a cry, laugh, call me over and hold me tiny in his arms, his bad breath and body odor covering me  you. Jimmy Hendrix and my father became drinking buddies. Jimmy Hendrix waited for my father to come home after a long night of drinking and here's at the ceremony work. I would lie awake all night listening to the sounds, my father's pick up. When I heard it I'd run downstairs, turn on the record by your Jimmy Hendrix and break into the stars, and go down or just as my father was. in the dark. He's blue. Walk over to the table, sit down, start drinking some more. I'd walk over there, lay down at his feet, he'd pass out on the table. I'd follow sleep at his feet and he'd dream the same. And then when he woke up in the morning, he'd feel so guilty. He'd tell me stories. He talked about how he met my mother. He'd say, yeah, mean your uncle Raymond was sitting in the power of heaven when your mother came walking. And she was real, calm about six feet and now he's beautifully. Uncle Rain, heard me and said, He's real tall, isn't it? When I said, Nah, You're all very innocent. Which I'd be thinking she is. When I said, I'm a zong. You're all very mean, didn't you? Real close to me and said, your reservations in Montana, isn't? Your mother and I ended out that night, sitting on the hood of a 65-malib, we both smoke and cigarettes, offering away, neither of a smoke, but we both thought. Another one is. So... somehow. My father's memories of my mother grew more beautiful, their relations became more hostile. At the time the divorce was fine. My mother was quite possibly the most beautiful woman. This. Your father was always happy, crazy. My mother's both parts weren't the other half was on the engaged. When my father and I were driving home, that's blizzard after basketball. , listening to the radio, we didn't have fun. When we heard this DJ, I'm the radio. Hello. out their boats , this big bill bagged with the late night classic cell on K-Rot, 97.2 on the Mithem dial. We have a request here from Betty and Tito. He wants to hear Jimmy Hendrix version of the Star Spangled Banner recording line. He's on the smile. Turn the volume up, roll down the height, well, Jimmy led the way  a stoke. Until that night, I'd always been nooks over that, Jimmy. He's put in that near blizzard with my father at the wheel. with the nervous silence caused by the dangerous roads who used good power, you seem to be more than all that was. That reverberation came to me some, , suffice for sick, something. , I said to my father, my generation of Indian boys ain't ever had no real work, but first Indians had custard of sight. My great grandfather had blood war one, my grandfather had world war teeth. That we've got, I don't have a video. I thought they're laughed for a long time, nearly drove off the road and the snowy streets. We kept driving through the snow, talked about war at least. Those were the kind of conversations that they gave me. I suppose it's not bad. I guess every song has a special meaning somewhere somewhere. I mean, help, stress, I suppose it's not enough. It's 70 left stores across the country, and those music are dead. So I figure music, just might be the most important thing there is. Music for my father. and do a reservation for lots of music , our format is, , I've bothered to tell me once, I remember the first time your mother and I dance, we were in this cowboy bar, we were the only real cowboys there despite the fact that we're in dance to a Hank Williams song, Hank Williams was a spoken-in dance to that real sad one,  that I'm so lonesome  you'd cry, except your mother and I were lonesome crying, we just shep her along and talk. So right god damn down love. Equalians and Jimmy Hendricks don't have much in common. Oh yes they do. They do all about broken pants and problems. You sound  a bad movie. Yeah well that's how it is. You kids today don't know. Stop the f*** that music. Especially you engine. You've all been spoiled by these crumbs. And hearing them so long you think that's all you mean. Hell, son even indian needs a piano guitar saxophone. My father played in a band in Christ, and he was in drama. And he was burned out on us. Now he was  the universe that defended him with a car. A few years back, my father packed up the family and the three of us grew up to see out or visit to you and you're in disgrace. We had our photographs taken long down next to that grave. There isn't a grave stone there. Just one of those flat markers. That's all that's left of two years. Just one year. That's younger than Jesus Christ, he does. Younger than my father, as he stood over the grain. Only the good, die young, mom said. Now, my mother said, only the crazy people took their death on their own mom. Why are you talking about my hero that way, my father asked? Not mother, said, I'll just see why I'll cheat, choke, death on his own mom. He ain't anybody's hero. I stood back and watched the lyrics. I was used to those battles. After a while, after too much fighting, too many angry words that had been exchanged. My father went out and bought a mortise site, a big army of dates. He left the house often to ride that drink, hours, sometimes for days, even strapped in a cassette player to the gas tank so he could listen to it. That bike, my father learned something new about running away. He stopped talking so much, stopped drinking so much. He didn't do much of any. and I thought he wrecked his bike on Devils Gap Road and ended up in the hospital for months. He ended up in a big surgery. Broke his legs, cracked his ribs, punctured along. He last rated his kid me really hit his head. And the doctor said he could have died easily. He was kind of surprised he made it and served me. And my father laid there in that coma for two months. I'm mother, went there every day. One day my mother was there holding my father's hand, . Even though the doctor said if my father woke up he might be somebody different, he might be somebody new, he might be vegetable. My mother said on that day, she was holding my father's hand. Because heart machine sounding  a drum and my father's finger started beating along, , with those heart machine sounding  a drum and mother said, I was in front of me this hand because he was way off. Now, now, what a father. Finally had the strength to sit up and talk, called conversations and tell stories he called for him, Victor, he said, stick with four wheels. Now he had to learn how to walk again. When he did, he walked out of that hospital, forgot he's advised me and got himself a new morto-sucked new, and ended up leading us completely, , and then I get postcards, , Browning Montanel, Opera Montanel, South Dakota, for awhile I got postcards nearly every week, Then it was once a month, then it was not Christmas, but then we didn't hear from him at all. My mother did her best to explain it all. This is because of Dumi Hendricks I asked her, hard to catch, said, This might be the only married broken up by a dead guitar player. He was the first time for everything, and I guess she said, You probably just  staying alone more than you . being through the deep, even me, me. Then on the night I missed my father's nose when I laid bed and cried with that photograph and beating that national gripe private in my hands. I imagined his motorcycle pulling up on the side. I knew that was dreaming in all but I met it be real for a moment. Victor and my father, let's go for a ride. I'll be right down, I said, I didn't get my coat. I rushed around the house, pulled my shoes and socks on, struggled in the face. my coat ran outside to find an empty and driving. I'm so quiet. I'm not impatient. I'm quiet. I can hear somebody drinking whiskey on the rocks, stream out of the way. I stood on the porch all night long. I got a man, I heard morto psychos get cars. Until the sun rose so bright that I knew, it's time to go back inside. , love. She came outside, took me back inside. I made a smoke wreck. and we ate till we were full. Charмиne elections,si snap, this story comes from the book of stories all chang budget, Christopher that, it is time how she gets the book shins free from the book poetry, I do. Coming up, one father leaves, another one returned, zoom in, whatever program continues. This American life, my request, our special Father's Day, and co-hosting with me for this day is my own father's very class , now he's certified public accountant involved for it, but once upon a time, that can tell he's plenty. A DJ, I or you also said you wanted a song, a deal with fathers, that's right, it's bringing a song. dealing with parties? I did. What have we got? It's by somebody that you may have never heard of because you're not any fisher. Wasn't he in the daily way that I know 80 fisher? Wasn't he one of Elizabeth Tamus? That's right. He was the one before the guy who she did clear pathway. Is that right? That's right. Have very sad for any fisher. This is all. I wouldn't tell. Here I am. I have a person in my mid-30s. Educated person at his all. I would. Now come 사람들 Richard Bernard The name of the song'sOMEisen It's  Jewish Mariochi music. Is that a little point? You couldn't get more on point. Actually one of our music is over. I'm not about your father. I will not. We are for the day. Do you want me to do it now? No, I'm not. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. You can't stop me. When he was... take me on his knees and with a smile he changed my tears to laughter oh my god that is going at you to me he was so wonderful ahI deservescreaming No, that's three. For moments that were. In this act, maybe Strick and Jay Allison. Jay Allison is this radio producer that all the people who worked behind this incident were the great of y'all. We all know him. He just won biggest award in public. Radio, get rid of a girl, or he just really unusual with a story. He was in Wood's Home Astros. He was in Cape Cod. One of his neighbors is a gunning Dan Glob and Dan Glob's greater in nature. Carfender and Jan Dan had an idea for a radio experiment Dan's father Let his family and Dan was working to just I think real quick and and Dan remembered that night Did it really thought he did But he never discussed his parents so that Jan courage Dan talk to us about this on heat and I'm gonna put you straight up again You I remember clearly the morning told me to do a separate. I was three and I leaned over my bed, narrow, cold. Something , don't take this change. Dad's moving out. What I remember is telling me to let him not have been. Then later that day, I remember watching my father's back, walked down the stairs, that side couch. There was cement and had a black, brown iron bed, running up the sun. And he was walking. down the steps away. He had a brown tweet jacked on, brown leather shoot, and he was carrying two brown suitcases. He put the mini Jeep back when they still said, well it's on the side, and he drove away. The steps were cement steps pretty steep. We got three flights, two little flights, these steps were not landing this down, and there was something crooked there your Navarrollmanet. I am Ray-Win. That's good. Now if I looked out the window and watched dad packing his car and then driving way at that time what kind of car would it have been? Well he had bought a little sports car because his car was in the shop and he didn't gonna pay it for the one thing and you shouldn't have traffic in that road borrowing fast. Ha ha. bought a little car so he could leave right away and told me he was leaving on trip across the country because that's what he had to do and other the spirit mind is to speed on the ground again. So we packed up and he got into the sports car and thought. What kind of car was it was a little triumphed? Huh? A little two door. There's a neat little car. Which I sort of got special for. trip. and I just wanted to get a way to put first and just sort of, we have my head out. But I remember telling Alice that I got back, I thought, I just wanted to keep. I had a lot of different feelings. I was angry that he'd done it. I was angry that he had ever taken down in me. You and me on a trip. And he was walking down the steps away from me. And he was harring two brown suitcases. He put the men's jeep back when they still said, Will is song aside. And he drove away. A little while before he left that day, he knelt down in front of me and tightened my belt and got out. I have a picture of that. His hands are big bigger than mine. Will ever be farmers' hands for a popular chance. and he's cinching the belt, gently tighter and saying something. I mean, I feel bad about all of the sort of gaps. When I wasn't there. And all of that time, once it's gone, it's gone. Never get it back. And in a relationship, in many ways, it built up memories. It never is you happy. the deep of the relationship. And if you miss it, you're gonna use it, man. Well, this is snapshot of this feeling we've found out for you. You were probably three or four, and you were four when you left. I don't remember exactly what the season was. It was an adamant fall of because I remember taking a lot of pictures of you. So… we get together. And he is sentient to the bell gently tied or saying something. Can't make out the words in the picture. Black and white. It shows me standing there three years old. In front of the big window that let the monochrome spread light and clipping high. Light is star. If all the cold burn to smell the steel and that city, it burns the color out of the air. And it reflects off his hair, which is smooth with my talents, and shows his strong job and the depth of his dark eyes. There was no abuse in that house. No harsh words in that ear. Just nothing. No father in name. And my mother sobbing on the dishes in the sink. What do you think you would have done after he had packed up his car and left? What would have been your reaction on my turn? Oh, you probably saw me sad and mournful, but then turning back to the house and trying to look cheerful. But I also felt, I also felt abandoned and I felt that it was the end of marriage, my hopes for Mary. I hope for a family for you and me and that's it. But I also felt a deep drop outside. Well, thank goodness, what a sense of relief. I'm free of all that abuse and misunderstanding and bad feeling that I'm going on. So long, at least  a DNA now. I'm not trying to be something that somebody else is. making me this. The split up was my do. And coming out of sort of culmination, my own, immaturity, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and slated hopes and expectations. And I think, I guess I just felt that I had never had any. Need a... I mean, I never had an ever really foul freedom. After so long, you sort of think, well, you're going to change your life. You're going to be whole your life, change that, change that, change that, change that. I was three, and I leaned over my bed, snare, and shoulders. Don't think this change is in the dance moving out. What I remember is telling you that it was not okay. I didn't want him to tell you first and he didn't want you to tell you you tell you. first so we did it together and I remember I knew it was a terrible blow for you. I don't remember telling you when first you were in bad at this picture and in that little room. Maple Heights. I came in and I said start to say something  that. leaving it forever. I was just saying, and you somehow knew what was coming. It was not of that. And you said, I don't want to hear it. And sort of, ,  put a pillow over your head. And kind of did one of this, and it was a pleasure to venture from. And this is what. And I've thought since then that actually when I walked out of your bedroom, that that was really a major turning through life. And I don't know this day whether it was for good. real. When my father left my bedroom, it was turning point for me too. It was the moment I moved outside the mid-term, family, left it and became part of something else. Something with no of them involved you to be followed to. And my rest is memory, that day, that week. I became part of the horse, which is ... to death, fam. And I turned down a path last well, mine. Last well lived. But I, unlike my father, no longer one, just for good or for ill. It just is. Okay, well, I think that's about it. This will be on the radio right before Father's Day. So I'd  to wish you have it fast. Oh, thank you. Welcome. And maybe we can make something good as this here. Thank you so much. Okay. I love you. You're welcome. Bye. , we don't need to reconcile, but , we don't. What had this next story is about a father and son. on the Father was this is pretty well known man here in Chicago. They James D. O'Reilly was an actor here and a director of the 1960s, 1980s. And a lot of people went to theater just, , just wanted to go to the theater and put theater, which are two theaters right now. And he wasn't the most reliable dad. And his son is a guy named. and I'm so excited to be able to play right in the book and musician and stage of the theater here in the end. And so has this story about a better spot, including a moment in the lives when the music is inside. When I was a little kid, Bob Six, my father would do these big marchions and some movies for college movies. And here we find the bad feeling turned, the magic clown screaming the lines of this. soul name and topic to step by step. When the show is done we would rush first to the bar and my father belonged to his name. Then to the train station to catch the last train home and I would get very Ken's then in half my stomach but I was going to burn up and pass out. So we would not miss the last train home and have to spend the long hours to come on when we can't station. My father found quickly and see. This huge head drum back in dream didn't even seem. It seemed to hang in possible iron angle from this one, the dotted bottom of the question mark. Then those that have to be there, but hang in time and untouched. And this seemed  other drum from snoring, big question mark on the presence. We'll be repeated numbers in terms of the next one part. I thought it passed out. that I'm able and pursuing my father, nodding off behind me or my father, snoring through the still Latin mayhem. My father's head fell back in the last room, during my high school production of the Blundestment Engineering. The only way he was awake is not to impress me with his silent room, main home once he was performing. And I would sit above my head and that train station. Listening to the music, rumbles in next morning's T-shirt on ship. in the modern tensions in the scene, but my father's snoring, he'd rusting noisy back too much soon, it's in fear. When I was 29, something changed between my father. I was 29 very drunk most days, and I came home to Chicago to work from my father's son, had read a scene in my alcohol, but his alcohol, but his alcohol, but his alcohol, but his daughter had been taking him away. in terms of what he used to go. And when my father got in this job as a house manager and sometimes understand and stealing from me. And he was warm, kind, kind, kind of guess. This kind was unusual, this happened to the rest of the night. I didn't know what it was going to be . Maybe he just recognized something, swan walk. And I overheard my power wings. I can't do any alcohol sparing it. We worked from then on during the development of mixed-word and theatre. I probably would be to put out, get a burger, a problem I probably meant to have, and I was all known to have. Now the purpose is we're fair and wrong with my father-alms that we can, crowded with actors and companies, all with one earpointed at night. are open for good jokes, which usually came on some word craigs, which came where, but when the river were always the river with a clear intention . These tables would start for people huge kinds of black things, round the air, but by one or two morning they would be empty. You need talking loud and the aggression of lovers and then broken hearts and politics in players and broken hearts and lost their own thoughts and broken hearts. Lead your most in talking my father nodding and grimacing working corporate and saying, But his eyes looking way long is... Scan bonds... ... and moons... in the problem we know. Sometimes these women stop by the cave and speak to my family. In prime and slime, these two kids seem to touch and question. Why in their eyes and things as in desire are given out, allow them to be sick in a public touch. The public closely missed the moment. The tables have been adapted to chairs and now holding a piggyback. In my father would science. and we have a flash and we have a card company. The off-matching in walks alone that we can have. A large man with a lovely, boldly old fashion in. Always aware that he's  something I don't Shakespeare or a woman. He might be swaying but swaying the charm and dignity. The further my family down at the street, the more real he comes in. Then. That was fun. I have a courtyard way to end the hotline, doing Shakespeare's new black scale view. And I would stand on the ground, find, find one that will drop in things, fub, thousand, and I think that was a better off ending than coming. I don't know what to watch in this. I was the husband and the chair, I was skittishing all the soup, and now I'm matching vintage times, really I'm into the door and some coffee, but mostly watching performances, night after night, I was just going to be a little bit more comfortable and I was just going to be a little bit more comfortable and I was just going to be a little bit more comfortable. I was going to be a little bit more comfortable. And perform suits, night after night. In my understudy assignment was not something any of us ever expected to use, but one week here it comes. And after the night came, and I was to pull my thighs towards your quick-looks in. It was an Irish play button, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish song, an Irish songs, liquorrolling right never fleas, not confessional paste. It would be werde hear, song. I thought in that in the last stage, but see the meanings, change my feeling from them and barking on us, or just that leaves my mind caught and frightened. Come soon, I'm ashamed. Leave my little hands and stand in one wrong places. And the matter with the form of some space in shaking the hall outside of the dream and when my family was in cashier, making up and preparing to perform, I could hear him talking, but they couldn't seem at all, they didn't know anything. And one of the actors said, with a good actors' projection, a side side to stitching, yet ready for amateur none. Want to be seen? My father seemed quiet and informed. I had ready for amateur none. yourself. Quick. Now this is the only time I ever heard my father became me. And I now realize the significance of that, but at the time I was very angry. And it was an angry that burned the fear out of me,  a fog, and a hot summer And that was fine, maybe the stage. I'm your study good enough. Come on. I played my father, he's either too well in the heart, by career's translations. I actually enjoy the remotes of real emotions between us. And I'm the stage, my father was reading the... I can complete our entouching community. And when the lights came down, I stummon of stage tripping from the... my father's name. His big, noble, right, turn into death. His own, joking, to see him. He has missed the curtain off. Pop! First of all, he was not one in this clip. A few months later, my father hired me during his production, the dresser called Lannon Khan. My father playing a Sir, a bullying, tyranical, Shakespearean actor, sir. My father was not on shrink from typecastle. And one of my sons was to meet him in the lab. Holding tall, watching, would use to wipe and make up and sweat from his face. Before he turned into the stage for the curtain call. I was in town. I wanted off to the pub for a time before the show. day, which usually taught there about many of them, I was in the house of crime, the phone, I was in the home of distance from them. So I'm dope, out of the fear of concessions into my friends. I was 29, John most of the time, and my father, he confused me from the environment. I was become very spent in the Voice of Friends, in the Players of the Netches. ồng and perhaps even some bears and unconfident, haven't seen himself in the day. He was by its own after, from state and in the end, and we continued to meet him of night and night. The Lord Riley's Chicago Playwright is show the 3rd Rees J.O. Rees is running in Chicago till he had a tune. He's also performing in a play called Trips by Jenny Magnus at the Steppenwolf Chicago엽 You see, I can find me in the light. Can you be here? Can you help me not be inside? , being at the skies, I see you. You'll realize which one is mine. We're all , but yesterday has waited for him. Close it to us, the light is so much darker.
