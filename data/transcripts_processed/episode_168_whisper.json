Signed to law and said, If you were a company that made with any kind of look or something, you had a distributor in Illinois. He was doing whatever he was doing, but he was just buying from you and that shipping stores or whatever. If you decided at some point you switched to a different distributor. Some of you service was better, reliable, whatever. So I said that unless a special board road that you had a good... reason to switch. The reason that it would be really really good.

The prime is we almost never. find out if we're right. Today, our program, we want to be find out if we get the most candidate satisfying proof possible. Today we have a story in which we get a look inside the back rooms of one international business. We see the intricate workings. Recorded on tape takes you to have people putting the fix. So the story of an FBI informant. Informant read so many different lies. Some people. eventually got caught by this guy. WVZ Chicago, it's this American life, I'm Eric Glass, today's program, fixes in, stay with us. I'm going to show you the fix being in from a global scale, five companies, which pancreas in the United States put in a company called ADM, Archer Denny's and everyone, based in the caterer of employment. company that donate aggressively to both the authorities, company whose chairman is most close to a number of presidents and senators, a company that has the fix in so thoroughly that you, I, all of us, are 80 and consumers. We don't even have any choice about. Literally, if you walk into an American kitchen and start taking away all the things that have 80 and ingredients and pretty soon you're not going to be able to make dinner. Pretty good I can well go to the public with fix at 80 and to the New York Times, and make it salad in a variety of gripping pounds.

They sell an additive that goes into laundry detergent. There isn't a single laundry detergent, it doesn't have a capacity. The same product is found in every form of soft drinks available on the market. So you have co-e up popsicles, you're dealing with 80. in a couple of different frames. This is a story of how ADM stock price dropped by 50% of the president of one of the largest divisions went to prison, company's vice chairman, some of his chairman. After the FBI caught ADM, Red Hand, on videotape engaged in an international criminal conspiracy. FBI's key witness was an informant in the CIA.

This division used biotechnology to make all sorts of food editors. And ADM's first big story into the field is a product called LIC, an additive product you can see about spattin' up fast. Micro-32, Voice looking and Outgoing. Things were not going well. The problem was that the LIC plan wasn't working. And one day... Mark Whitaker came into the office and he said, I just received a phone call at my home and one of our competitors and they have a saboteur in our plant, a man who called me, said he would identify the saboteur at me, paid him $10 million. And what should we do? And ADM reacted to that first by learning the central intelligence agency, which determined that they had no authority of this matter, so the matter was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In much much later, Mark Whitaker admitted that he had made the soft action. The whole story of the saboteur of the centuries. It's possible that Whitaker told the story to buy himself more time to get the client running. In any case, this one line is the F1 line. They start poking around and he's , I'm not, I'm a bit, I can't even do. special agent named Brian Sheppard, dropped him on one of the witness house. But advice on this fund, which was called the Whitaker was supposedly getting his phone calls from the competitor asking for money. So the FBI wanted to get that on tape. He hooked up with the device. He was about to head out the door, marked Whitaker's wife. He was aware that there were other things going on at 80. that her husband had not told me at the eye. He was pushing him to open up. He wasn't going to. As Shepherd literally was headed out to his car, she began to push past her husband to go outside and tell the agent what she did. And instead, Riddaker called out to, and said, you have a moment. So he stops the age and he tells the age. What? Well he and Dan Shepherd go into Shepherd's car and they're sitting there and he after dancing around the topic for some time. He tells Shepherd, I have been working with AEM to fix world wide prices of LIC, and it's not just LIC, we fixed prices in a number of products. What Wittaker was telling Shepard that night was ADM is in a massive conspiracy in all of its competitors in this market to rip off its customers. I won't love what this is a completely fool-hardy thing to say to a better relation. And if you ask Mark Wittaker today about why he did it, tell you that he felt boxed in, it's why it could have problem anyway, but the FBI would see you at something he's going to talk about. some phone calls. Once he said it, the FBI asked him to prove it, by recording some conversations that would confirm this rather than credible story. So Mark, please, I think he would take each time. Here he is. The guy , goal was what I was hoping was, was that we would have that meeting that night. I would have verified it in a tape a couple days later and that would have been it. That would have been a great amount of three years. I met with FBI sometimes two nights a week, it ended up being a second job for me, to diminish my hours. Hopefully, there's three nights. Well, I made literally hundreds of dates, I think, both 200 hours of dates, hundreds of dates and so on. I've spoken to a lot of people who want enforcement about what I've been into today. Again, the quarter credit I can quote. And again, again, I have heard phrases ... There has never been co-occurring what he's  this guy. I've never seen anybody who's so skilled in doing it. It'll be if you talk about this, or this, or they've ever had. They have been. They don't have a lot. He was co-operating witness on a scale  there has never been seen. I mean, this was an individual at the highest reaches of a Fortune 500 company who was walking around. Why? All the time. Hey, Mr. Guy. Why are you? And he was very, very good at it. He was very good at drawing people out. He was very good at making sure people were positioned in front of the cameras that were hidden away from someone. He was very good at getting... them to repeat themselves. In other words, there is a earlier conversation that was missed on tape so it got them to repeat everything in the tapes were wrong. Good job. How do you feel about the meeting in your parents? Gladly. Dr. Wartiff meeting. How do you feel about my children? How do you feel about the meeting? How do you feel about the meeting? How do you feel about the meeting? I think so. I've learned him as one of the two FBI agents for almost causing mock-wet curve. He says that one of the way to Christmas has been classic moments, was right at the beginning in the investigation. And the FBI had this problem that they did not know how to solve. Yes. They knew that the five companies that make license need, they were two can create a two-inch man, in the DM. But companies always met overseas, outside the reach of the U.S law enforcement. Done, which is where the FBI is not allowed to set up secret cameras and videos. So, how to get them to meet in the US? Who's Agent Green? We would have these deep briefings sessions about once a week. Let's take a look at one and July in 1993. By the way, one sign that you have testified in the federal trial, you remember the dates of every year. And July in 1993. That night, myself and I am shepherd the other agent I work with in the schools. We're kind of hitting him hard, but what suggestions can you come up? How can we get this next meeting between all of the competitors in the United States? And it was Mark Whitaker himself, it's just gone. And so they think about it, and why he has great golf courses, again reported credit more. And so they tell Whitaker to dangle the prospects of a golf game. on a stellar course and why to the Japanese competitors as a means of enticing them to come through nine states. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm in charge of a month off here. I'm thinking is it the mock thinking? But we were listening to the call on calls going on. Mark, where could we ask this one to think about coming to the United States for the next I think in our next meeting, it's you guys go straight to Vancouver meeting. I think ADM shows to make a meeting, don't you think? Yeah, good fun. And maybe we hosted in, , rally. Oh, you. So, I have a license meeting to group meeting. we have a lot of time at Vancouver. And group license meeting, you have an evaluate, you have an evaluate. While we're high is, , still the United States. Now, of course, winner knows exactly what needs. What's wrong with Stolja's State? But rather letting it drop, he says. Well, what does that mean still in the United States? What's it on tape? Yeah, but what's that mean? It's still in the United States means the United States is very severe for the control of the Democratic Party. Well, there's your bingo moment. The man just stated, still in the United States means that the United States is very severe for the control of any processes. That statement there is about current. The motto is explanation about. the laws of the United States became a very key state of prosecution against them. That statement showed that the competitors knew what they were doing, that's why we were in the law of the United States. And as soon as he gets set on tape, what if your moves on? Go back to trying to lure. Next big praises, well Hawaii next to an 18-hole golf course. He's not going to let it go. Thanks a lot for joining us next time. Thank you for watching. I'm going to start the engine in the engine over that part. So how is it really convenient for us to kind of know? Oh, if you're company, just no problem, maybe I will come to the rig of the fact. Again, my quick. I was in chance about it. They wanted something. I was going to get it. It's a beautiful. If you can use SICA before one of these meetings that is what you would have thing you would have to do to taste it . Yes, this, this, this, here's the way I'm going to play this on. Go through that. I would have with men to go over every detail, every detail. And they would tell me three or four things they needed in particular. And I didn't have to write it down and I would remember make sure each one of those needs that I hit all three or four of those things and every single move. I was obsessed with it. Fun calls were, they had the meeting in Hawaii, and other meetings as well. For one get together in Atlanta, the taper court is the sealed inside Whittaker's briefcase wasn't working. So, I left it with FBI agents, frankly tried to fix it, and then he went to the meeting with a big five license, getting together, where secret camels are ready to conceal inside a lamp. So, they're right. They arrive in a very nice room and it's the very opening thing. The lack of a better room taking attendance and wooddocker says to the assembled crew, we have a couple of other people joining us, don't think down the evening. We'll want to be exactly the same. Then someone in the room says it was a two more from this Korean company. There you go, two more. and you're being exactly as far as I can. And more European executives is over fixing himself and drinking the banquet card. No, no, no. It's two more from the Korean company and one from Tyson, one from Canagra. What's the price of what's going to drive one from Canagra? This is, I guess, price fixing humor. Tyson and Canagra are the customers who will be. among those who are being cheated. And so, one of the Japanese executives jumps in with his own joke, who looks straight at Whitaker and says, One from FBI, which, in fact, is exactly what Whitaker was. Now, as all this is going on in the other room, the FBI at that moment has six. successfully fixed the briefcase of quarter. And so they need to get it back to them. So there, the conspirators are laughing about FBI FTC. There's a knock at the door. Right on the back of the door. And one of the Japanese executives looks up and says yes. FTC. And Whitaker walks over and opens the door. And then, No, it wasn't the FBC, it was the FBI. At this point, the agent, Hot Perned in, Pansy works for the hotel and says, I hope I have the right room. This was left down in the cafeteria, hands with briefcase, some quarter. When they said that, did your cart just sing? No, they're... at that point I've already made tastes well, two years, that one. And I knew there were just joking. And there were a lot of ups and trust in me. Did you imagine to yourself, what would have happened to the cut-out? I just wanted to ask questions that I've never heard of. I mean, I was very trusted with the speech that I've seen. Being stuck, to be the next president of the whole company. And I was so trusted with the government. Also among the Japanese and Green Company. That there was just no way that I was able to turn back. Did you have a plan for what you would say if you had somebody noticed the wiring? But I really didn't have a plan, I was just counting on it and not getting caught. I told writer Kurt I can walk, he's been years getting to know Mark literature, I surprised I was, when literature told me he never considered the prospecting he caught. I wasn't sure if he was timing the truth, I totally believe that. With a Kurt always that no one would ever question. He would sometimes come into the United States carrying cash in his suitcase that he did not declare, not effectively getting it here crime. It doesn't mean thousands of dollars. Thousands of dollars in cash. And when asked, well, what would you have done if you had been caught? He looked at the person asking the question inifty? and said, well, it never occurred to me to stop. Why would that happen? I'm a spectrum guy, I'm a... I'm a guy where I'm there, so, time, exactly. Why would they have to stop me? And that's the kind of attitude. You just, you just always believes that you've got control of the situation. And in the end, that's also the trait that when you're talking about your mind, you're just talking about what's happening now, which is different now. That's Louis. On these tapes, the other men at the Price Weeks and the news also seem to have remarkable faith that they want to be caught. What striking is not how nervous they are, since they set up an international criminal conspiracy. How it is. People come to deliver lunch, they do not even bother to hide the chart that they've made, providing the world market among themselves. If anything, they make world domination to see profoundly the now. Typical tape. The scene is a married hotel. conference room in Irvine, California, happy to breakfast well as on the table, hotel coffee, cooling in the air conditioning, there's an easel, one does the corporate presentation note pads, and can't take over the world without magic markers. In the movies this would happen somewhere in a hollowed out volcano. no, no remote, set timer. Fixing the world market turns out to involve dozens, picky little tales. You're going to raise the price, should you do it all at once, or gradual? How gradually? What should the prices be for bushels, parvars, for deliberate and underwebbing? For path orders? There is a surprising amount along division. Contractions, multiplication, long puzzles for work out the math. Okay. Just a little bit of time, sir. 6, okay? That's 10, 23, 12, 12, 12, 11, 10, 10, 12, and 10. It's sitting in a little thrilling to think that any great fifth grader, as the mascot, is necessary to fix the go-go market. Many young people listen to the radio right now. I've ever asked the eternal question, when in real life will I ever use long division? Now,  when? Well, committing crimes. There is one point in this conspiracy. where these conspirators sit and they're ready to fix the Canadian market. And they do so by flipping open the paper, with the newspaper, checking the exchange rate to that day, running a quick calculations and saying, okay, here's the price and Canada moving on. And they literally fixed a $100 million market in two months. The only hard part to running an international criminal conspiracy of kind of what you'd expect, they have trouble trusting each other. And it's not worth it. had a verify that everyone is sticking by the agreement, talk a lot about that. One point somebody even is just calling in auditors from the accounting firm. It's not clear how to divide all the profits. And this is a very interesting business problem. If they are essentially bypassing the workings of the free market that is, if they're not going to be competing for customers anymore, if they're all going to have the same price, the fixed is really in. And they have to decide upfront how much of the world market in licensing. Each of the five companies will be allowed to have. But let's do 1000. So they want to take one too. Do one too. We want to say that they say about this problem. The first two. Anyone wants to. They can play, they'll make it every one of the other. They're good to. That's it. That's it. So they're a good player. That's right. That's it. Awesome. If you're no longer working in a real. competitive market, it kind of destroys the normal ways that your sales force is going to work. No longer with your salesmen be able to get business, for example offering a lower price to the customer. So what are they going to do instead? Who's the sales? This is Nadine's. Put the counterintuitive. And it's going to be very hard to explain to your sales team, since they will not know if it's a sin. Let's talk with you. Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk with you. I've written a lot about corporate crime over the years and now often it's speeches. Again, for the credit I can walk. One of the things I used to say that I don't say anymore is the misconception of what color crime is that. It starts off with some top level executives sitting down, pointing at the underlings, and let's go break the law. I said, usually much more subtle. Well, boy was iron. You look at these tapes and it is indisputable. That is exactly what was happening in the ADM. I want these workers to be able to get out of the ADM. They are not working. They are not working. We've got to help. They've got to help. They're not working. They're not working. They're not working. Again, FBI informant for my aid. I'm in techative, my Twitter. Customers are enemy that there's a friend hired that on his tongue. That should be the slogan, not super hard to grow. To go on, I would talk about that slogan, super hard to grow. I would say I'm on Sunday, unlike me, to press and 80s that would come on, super hard to grow. We're so fast, we're so focused, we're so focused. And I'm thinking, we're shoot. There's a whole week we've been fixed, in order to rip off the consumers. We sure not, we're not the supermarket for one. Super primals of the world of the world. The US Justice Department estimates that ADM made $80 million for some price of life in it. By a tech division, it's been in red to lead to a huge profit center, not where they're clans and they went from $7 million to $7 million in losses to $7 million in revenue. This presumably nudged up the price of chickens. in court for you and me by the tens. For agriculture, cultural businesses, then a lot more than that, during the secret investigation, one of the FBI agents on the case, and John Hoyt visited his sister and his brother-in-law, brother-in-law just started some feed business. Could I come out to a story? As a farmer, he was always dependent on the banks and the weather and a lot of things beyond his control. And he had decided to try and take control of his life. And this agent is sitting there after... in her with her brother-in-law and they're just looking up at the stars. And his brother-in-law starts spilling the story of how trouble businesses, how much difficult these having, because lysine crisis are going through the roof. And he doesn't know how he's going to keep the business going. And the age of his listening to this, knowing not only that, prices are not going to come down anytime soon. What? Forg. She can't say anything about it. We're coming up at the break. What happens when the person was lying to everyone, so he can help the FBI and definitely lying to the FBI as well. Lying in the big way. That's in a minute. Go video. They'll help prevent it. Yes. Smack in life, man. We can approach them of course to some theme stories on that. Today's program, Exitzen, we're going to go to program today to the story that we originally ran on our show in the year 2000. We just made a heard story on our show and years later, the story was made to a movie called the Format, it's  Matt Damon. This is the story. Stories about an international crime conspiracy and about something called EDM, Archivore and it's minimum. And if the IMFUNK revealed this series, walk with her. One of us. stressful things for any person who did his job to make me a secret moment. Mark Wetterkert worked as a double agent in his own life for three years, and it times he became a bit strange. For instance, he firmly believed up until the end that when it was revealed that he had been spying on his coworkers, he couldn't even be running 80-year. Company would reward him by promoting him to precedent. Or he do things  trying to talk to NetBiH and that. While they were in a public rest. the great wisdom himself, the executive seems to be keeping, just outside. He's reported, the truth is that Mark Whitaker had some, and I believe, have some, the psychological issues that dry a lot of what he did. I mean, this was a man who in the course of this investigation literally coming upon. This was a man who stops sleeping. Being in the situation during the time I would not have said that my little state deteriorating up just in things. My wife tells me in other sense, since that time I was going to wow five years, it's 1995. But my wife's told me there's many times that I would be out driving two or three in the morning, blowing, driving well, the gas blow we're blowing the leaves off and it'd be raining. So you're standing out there in the middle of the night and we close every park. My wife and kids remember that. Freakment. And it'd be raining. And it'd be raining. I'd be blown leaves as a rain. I'd be came over from BOSS as it was all of all of the strands. So we're from BOSS, on certain things. And the driveway, the one thing is I'd be getting addicted to it. So my wife costs, , you have to sleep. I felt , well, why late there? You can't sleep. So I'd go up to the distance. I'd go over the horse table. I'd be riding horses three, four, and the morning come over. Sleep for an hour, take a shower and go. work. Work to 6.70, FBI need me, be come back and start to routine all over it. Before I was, were you especially close to any of these guys who worked? No, not long, not long. I mean I was close to a lot of people in the company but not for once every heart of this investigation. What was it  for you knowing that you're taking them and building a case against them? Because they are using them , what was that ? It was nerve wrack, I mean it was just so much deception, so much deception, so long that I mean you're acting as a friend, you're out, you're taking them I mean, you're all  this deception There were three distinct lives in the market, you see? Who's deceiving something? Some people that that could square-brating these competitors, used to see the others about the fact that it used square-brating the P.F.B.R. And after three years, we've been seven nights a week with P.F.B.R.B.R.B.R. Well, I've been turned out used to see the P.F.B.R. as well. Very one-lunch over Moushou's pocket-boy. They're all on-ramp. Again, specialization conference. On the first week of August, 95, myself and Brian Shepherd pick Mark Wake up. house and we looked at a Chinese restaurant. This from the very beginning after knowing more for two and a half years, it was pretty easy to see, something was on his mind. He wanted to tell us, in fact, he started out conversation by saying, my attorney does not want me to tell you this, but I need to tell you something. Alright, there's a mark, time out. You're not going to tell us. anything your turn is not what you're telling us. We're quote a correct I can. But Whitaker can't stop himself and while they're at lunch Whitaker finally begins to spill his story. He starts talking about, , given this example, to start saying, is this a cry? For example, he starts talking about WHOA state tense in-pensus. Yeah. And they tell them, , this is not a thing. I'm worried about it. The workers as well, suppose an executive used to cooperate airplane for personal use. Wow. The agent telling me some tax implications, but it's not an amazing problem. And, you understand? Let me give you one more. What if the activity involves was this? kickbacks to corporate executives. At that point in time I said mark, what is it that you weren't telling us? What is on your mind? And then after asking that question he says, well, I need to tell you guys. A star seat tell us about his investment, $500,000 from the evening. What did you say? Why? Why didn't you tell us before? What is wrong with you? What were you thinking? And is this it? Is there anything else? Are there any other skeletons in your closet? Did you take any more than just five hundred thousand? Is this it? With someone else? By the river. Just em... We started to have лишations, where can we swim without the water? Is this it? I was thinking finally, town trees are surely hiding. You can take pictures of me  that being alone. war up and down, and $500,000 for this game. And that turned out not to be truthful. No. It turned out that he and Bezel go for $9 million. Jim Griffin is a deputy assistant attorney general, Justice Department's anti-trust division in Washington, D.C. There's one of the lead prosecutors in the ATM case. I'm just hearing the news. that's investment. I could hardly forget that. It was August 3, 19th. Trying to write up there was one of the worst days of my professional career. At that point, was you feeling that you could very sweetly achieve the last things? It's not a happy day, we're here. Cooper, he went. in disperse the blind, telling the story to your describing, ventz reading out to, and capture on tape. And it's a saddest point, it's credibility. It's obviously useless as a witness and is engaged in criminal activity. You may have to investigate and prosecute. One frightening possibility for the prosecution, that none of this beautiful video tapes unprecedented initiatives, corporate officials conspiring to fix prices, all came stakily shot three years. None of them be useful in court because they wouldn't have a witness who confirmed what they were, who the people were, when they all happened. Justice Department solved this against some of the foreign businessmen who were testifying against the new. By concealing his investment from the FBI, three years during the investigation , Mark Wittaker violated the terms of what it meant to be a cooperating witness. That only will be prosecuted for the night. in half million dollars, who would also be prosecuted by Christfixing. In other words, the video tapes that he had made so careful would be used as evidence against him. To this day, Mark Woodaker insisted it was common in ADM, for example, to decipher an ophthalmone, he did, himself. It was expected that the only reason that ADM, for the federal government, about it, was to punish him. Federal authorities and journalists, including for a icon law, investigated this client, and found no evidence to prove. THE DON 언 The kinds of comments that this Map Lizard drum factor is verification in talking. Well, what is a title of map Analysis script? And that explains this Desktop. Script, cartoon or Gmail. Would you want to just start the theme? I mean, I thought this themes, do I really  this Darrym's Chaos Org? But, just a bit to summarize something! Meteor gale Logoking, Things All over? secure the script, sword,ion, or Melmd to stuff, Orgbass. The same as name code, Heeyf, and Castigapas Еp time. This is the final idea, and has italian relations. The government had great evidence to make a sense of the use of Epstein wanted to convince him to offer what the book he wrote. He'll deeply exchange for his sense. Epstein went to Washington and made what my all accounts was a stellar presentation where he talked about rather than talking about Mark Whittaker's a person. He talked about Mark Whittaker's Mark Whittaker as what this means. for law enforcement. Yes, Mark stole $9,000, but he gave you people who are committing crimes, many, many multiple cases. And if what ends up happening here is you guys insist on having very long sentence, then we will have a sentence here. And I will lay out everything that has happened to Mark. Good, bad and different. I will lay out. he has been out there by himself for two years. I will lay out how he hadn't trained, how he hadn't supported. And the statement he made that just rang throughout the room is, and then all of my words would be picked up and newspaper is all around the country. Everyone will read it, and you will never ever get a phone call from somebody who might be a cooperating witness again. And it's true. and it was very powerful and they were there was the possibility that Whitaker would end up with his little three years. Fsteen was very happy about this, but when he presented it to Whitaker, Whitaker reacted to that by deciding, , it's a personal loss of the play guilty. Essentially, he decided that Fsteen must be part of the play. government conspiracy to get it. What if you're fired if things got them something new or somebody without much experience in this In some sense the last straw came for literature when he accused the FBI age that contacting the first place Brian Shepherd, a ordering him to destroy evidence denying him access to doctors and lawyers. Surresters, they later admitted that he made up. But they did a lot of them. message on the cell. What if or didn't know that behind the scenes the people in the in the trust case were trying to get news to your gout for him? , what it could does have this thing of thought. He did have this thing of turning against people who was allies and turned against Jim Appstein in his first lawyer and turned against the FBI that luckily among any trustees. And he turns around and goes after, , a loved member of this team. story that up ends this man's career that opened up in the investigation, the he has to lawyer. I mean, they have to be his lawsuit he has to deal with. At that point Mark Whitaker had nobody in the government who could even slide us to write. Care won, but what happened? Whitaker was sentenced to 10 and a half years. The ADM executives, the executive price fixing, may have services of two years. They haven't been a PLM in a set of three. ADM paid a fine $100 million, a fine 10 times bigger than an previously successful fund. Who's the land market? It changed how the aditros function. And the entire justice team viewed business conduct. This is Jim Machnick, one of the federal processes. sense that when I started the United Trust Division in 1991, and I just prosecution who won't white glove and quarantine, for example, it was virtually incurred up to conduct search once, to use table quarterbacks, to engage in confrontational interviewing, meaning that unannounced, drop it interviews by agents and attorneys of suspected face constituents. Just enough. It seems to think Stri l' balanced. what degree that change in our enforcement is due to my quidditch. I don't think any of the people still need to vision  to admit it how much she's met to Anna trust enforcement but you're asking me he was it totally changed the Anna trust enforcement path. What a flawed vessel for us. So doing good? You need to admit. Yes. Did it? Any I'm didn't exact. the Indian Trust division, tackle more cases. The 85 cases felt following here, in just 66 years after that. I have this case as we're international ones, and GADMs, the investigations from our aggressive. The previous sense of just how quickly the fines grew, the N was the largest fine ever, that in 1995, 30,000 Zoom bit larger. And it just prosecutions netted over $1 billion in fines, and just those four years, half of that from just one case, half billion dollar penalty, off minimum. of the road fixing prices and vitamins. Everyone who either sell expensive. And to get it to the question that I think we all wonder about when we hear about these kinds of cases. Here's what we'll talk about. I have a special agent, Fernden. And how typically do you think this is? Well, it's strictly speaking for what the evidence the case showed us. It appears to me that this is more typical than we realized. Yeah. , we saw how casual. these business execs were and dealing with one another. , we used to joke at one point in the case that you saw a group of middle age white males gray hair getting together in a hotel room during the middle of the day. No good, you come from all. So when you're in the grocery store, do you think about this stuff? I do now. I didn't just look at the products in the supermarket, it was suspicious. I looked at everything that's on sale everywhere. Right at Kurt I can. Once from my head when I was driving, once from my head when I was going to sleep, once from my head when I was walking down through the grocery store. Once from my head when I opened my refrigerator, I used to look at the ingredients labels on the helmet mayonnaise. Let's see what the ingredients were from baby yen. There is no way to watch these tapes and listen to these tapes and not wonder. In my right now being a victim of criminal conspiracy. And to this day I don't really answer that question. I'd  to pair everything unfolded. One of the most intriguing questions I've had this entire I'll see you in the next video. was part of the conspiracy, and agreeing to help the FBI. What he says to this day that he only did that, because it was why since his death, because the possibility that he would be caught by the and the crisis in himself. But maybe, just maybe, he agreed to cooperate with the FBI. This he suddenly realized that they were sneaking around and they might discover that he was a bastard. Correcting. If you think about it, he knew the entire saboteurs or story , the thing that had gotten the FBI there, was it?
