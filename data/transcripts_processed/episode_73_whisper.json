We're many of the Italian masters at Gravaggio, from Raspiel, and many Italian painters from the Venetian period, and then putting them in the Vinci and the Liza, I'm standing by the cost of life from the Liza. And then you're speaking to us on a cell phone, from there, from there. I was in Italy once and for me, and I went to the museum where they have Michelin Charles statue of David, he was a snapshot in using pictures of this. And as I stood there, all around the statue were people talking about what restaurant they were going to go to later when they were going to meet the friends. , you just didn't just think how good the statue have to be to actually get their undivided attention. What is him already? is that to do. And this is not just my grandnames problem. We sent out an actual foreign correspondent, Jim Ditterman, to the roof, and he discovered that Leonardo da Vinci is also having trouble touching people's hearts in the museum set. What are the great debates that taking point here around the hallways is exactly how expensive it is and why it's value that so much, , the people are talking about what it is exactly that makes this painting so special. chord noises I had one woman say, well I had her smile, another woman said, no, no, no, it's her eyes. She says, , you're the eye, follow you anywhere in the room. And that she says to a friend go over there in the corner. She's looking at you and she stops the club from, , she's looking at you and I can't you see her looking at you over there. So Jim, do people stand next to the money we set and talk about things that have nothing to do with the painting at all? Oh, absolutely, yeah. I mean, and also you get a lot of people sort of press to get other places. They get other places. is  tired dad you said you were gonna take that stuff around for now, we're seeing this fun gel and got this a lot of that. It actually makes you feel bad for artists . A group must feel no sympathy for whatsoever. I mean imagine an artist's life. It takes years to develop any skills. It's intensely difficult to learn. It's very very competitive. Almost nobody makes any money doing it. Though gel sees none for treatment and then, we'll somehow somehow. Your work is recognized in your end up in Newsy-M. Perhaps intratably, you end up in a world-class museum  the Youth. This is how you treat it, even here. One woman stood in front of her, and she said, I saw a film wanted it. She's a really close to the painting, she doesn't look that good at all. What do people want, Advaun? What are they looking for anyway? Do , imagine Dimension's horror, if you create the analogy of this following change between Jim and Jim. Jim is a possible field of walked over to the monolason right now. I'd  to act to it right now. You are. I'm standing right at the rail, there's a whole crew class, not at the rail, it stands out about five feet here that teach people away. It's quite a lot for standing and it's true, or I do found them. They do? Yes, I'm quite off the side right now, but if I go across and I'm not to feed this boy, I would be because I know that this is a video here, so I'm going to go over to the every five here. I mean, it's centered in our house and she's looking straight at me. She's got that in a matter of time. She's a she might be smoking a better piece of it. But it could be wrong. Now I'm going to the left side and she's still stirring that. I'm over here. Well today and our problem, people who thought that they actually knew better about art, better than cities, better than jam, and they actually became artists. And what happened to them? From the BB-ease Chicago, in public radio and international, it's a American life, in my request, our program today, brainnet on art, act one, the cut-foot world of balloon animal artists, no kidding balloon animal artists, act two, greater David Cedaris with Count's own shameful career as a performance artist, and I was tone-up, clicking, ended up in the museum, act green, reverb, a hardcore jazz song, learn to love what some of consider the worst music in the world. in the music is spotted by it. At four, race note, the story from New York, locksmith, Tio Cosman, Stabilis. At one, glyphine bubble. And the one of the artists, successors and failures are carefully measured, people hold bridges, people who are accused of selling out. If any story is everywhere, you will depend with rock scene in Chicago or Seattle, with the galleries in the South Hough. The theater scene pretty much anywhere on the theater is made in more on the... planning. But you might not expect to find these kinds of stories, but the poison. Toy Fair is the big trade show for the toy world, thousands of manufacturers and buyers descend the New York City for the event every year are contributing at a their pot-toth lamp and air and suit flenders. The toy and for the moon. Aaron and I are walking through the entrance hall of the Jacob Jefferson just hanging and talking from some of the museums I'm sharing.

If anyone wants to be a balloon, this is an artist. Inventing quite a few designs is Aaron. for instance, we made the first video game ever. He hasn't shown any of them for the last time.

Just recently, 13, that was an 18 sense. What the hell are you got at? And really, it's not a total surprise that this time was the last time. He's in a building in Disney City.

Now I have mastered this point. He's got no boss, no set-out. He makes little kids happy. It seems  a dream dream. But it's not a dream. His dream is to be an artist. A real artist. But in real wants to be a artist. Is this? I mean for a long time I did have a lot of heat relationship with balloons and it took me a lot of get over that. There is a sort of darker side. This isn't something that I always thought I would do. My whole life, it's not the mark that I had ever intended for my whole life to make on the world. I am a musician and actually have always hoped and helped to make a musical mark in some way. That is very traditional. Beloons more crass and music more an art and I've always considered myself first in pharmacy musician This is from C.D. called The Day of Justice and everything is fun to do that.

When the moniker Bess Seller was added to my book suddenly, I had some serious issues of jealousy and envy from almost all of my, particularly male friends at that point in my life, I noticed that questions of success, in failure, and contentment with their own lives, were brought to the fore that this sort of force the question, , I'll ear and the Bess Seller's. So, let's still listen to the shows. The balloons actually come from the company and the other friends from the London and the Elizabeth at the museum. Yeah, that's actually it. I've had to die at the end very long-term meaningful friendships for me. This is not most successful, as friends, especially as my friends, with your normal critical. He bought a house, he bought a car, he bought a marriage, he had kids, or paid for the balloons. This is the one that seems to be... I'm not saying creative community. Yes, you can come. I be more on the loss of my male friends. That's my wife and I share all the time. I'm a person who is very friendly and who has thousands of acquaintances that I have no friends.

There are no... a few weeks later, hard to convey, I think, over the radio, but what was just created during that little speech at the period was a teddy bear. It's not something about human nature, but even in this world, the teddy bear was in some dryness, success, and so forth. That became a key to building and was to destroy it to human, to a lot on friends and one of my closest friends just recently, I still have a... years although there had been a significant period of establishment.

There are some people in the same time, more than the likes, people in the theatre and the theatre and the theatre. But this isn't as bad as the others. There is a certain part of me that gets really alienated when I walk around here. This is sometimes I look around and I'm a hit to see this, but I look around and there's anyone that I need to share too much talking. What's happening to Aaron is what happens to a lot of cousins, people, and finds the relationship of success. Without unity, he has become a businessman.

After a few months in my parents' basement, I took an apartment and you stay in a ver. where I discovered both Crystal Method and Fatamine and Conceptual Art. Either one of these things is dangerous enough, but the combination has a potential to destroy entire civilizations.

For God's sake, my father would say it's for a clock in the morning, what are you calling for? I was calling because he rusted my friends to take and dump, plugging their phones after 10 p.m. These were people I'd known in. high school and are disappointed me to see how little we now had in common. These people were all stuck in the past, setting up their booze at the art fair and thinking themselves successful to design sold a silk screen pictureing a footprint in the sand. Didn't they read any of the magazines? The new breed of artists wanted nothing to do with duty. Here were people who made a living pitching tents or lying in a fetal position before our national monuments. The film fellow had made a name for himself by allowing a friend to shoot him in the shoulder. This was the art world I'd been dreaming of where God given talent was considered a hindrance. Let me put your mother on my father would say. She's had a few drinks and maybe she can understand whatever the hell it is you're talking about. I bought my drugs from a Y repop I sort of ordered cook, whose brittle prematurely white hair was teased in such a way that I couldn't look at her without thinking of a dandelion. The drug had a way of turning people into either really good. sex partners, or very bad artists, and she seemed to know exactly which group I might fit into. She introduced me to a handful of jittery motormails who shared my love of the word manifesto. The first meeting was tense, but I broke the ice by laying out a few lines of crystal and commenting on my hosts with Russian Latin furniture. This was an understatement, as is living room contained nothing but an enormous nest made from human hair. a week to all the local salons and barber shops collecting their sweepings and arranging them strand by strand as carefully as a ran. I've been building this nest for about six months now, we said, go ahead, have a seat. Inspired by my friends, I started on a few pieces of my own. My first project was a series of wooden vegetable crates I filled with my garbage. Seeing as I no longer ate anything, there were no rottings. the word scraps to worry about, just cigarette butts, aspirin tans, wards of hair and bloody cleanets. Because this was art, I'm meticulously recorded each entry using an ink I'd made from the crushed bodies and tips and the steams. 2017, A.M. Fortone out to things dust from Linda Sil, moss. I was a busy man. When two of my crates were completed, I carried them down to the art museum for consideration in the upper hand a very bionne. The next few weeks were spent basically camping out beside my mailbox waiting to hear what the state of North Carolina had to say about the artistic merits of my Tonyan club When the news arrived that I had been accepted, I should have kept the information to myself. My friends proposed those to set fire to the grand staircase and sculpt the governor's head out of human feces that all been rejected. This confirmed their outsider status and made me suspect. At the next week meeting it was suggested that the museum had accepted my work. only because it was deputive and using the swallow. My friends could have gotten the anesthetic compromised themselves, but unlike me, that was not there, stunned. After the exhibited end, I burned my crates, storing the ashes in a top of where a bowl I pecked in the bathroom, my closet. I told my friends that I hated every moment of the museum reception. Only then did I find myself back in the goods' good graces. I had paid for my salary, and as a reward was invited to take part in the nest-builders' performance piece. the meeting where seven of us churped and bleeding what a matter to the script. I wanted to point out that I'd had a bit of that experience in the past, but covered with a waste in human hair, it seemed best not to mention it. One of the cast members stormed out in tears after being told she wasn't mowning properly, and the rest of us suffered a continuing plague of splinters and heat losses. I never understood what the piece was about and never asked because I didn't want to appear stupid. My parents attended the premier sitting in class leg and I'm one of the mats. spread  islands across the selfie concrete floor. The local newspaper ran a review, had lined local group pitches in, pleans up warehouse. This did nothing to encourage ticket buyers whose numbers dwindled to the single digits by the second night of our week long run. Luckily, you found it easy to blame not ourselves, but a public, so brainwashed by television, that they found it impossible to sit through a two and a half hour performance piece without complaining of boredom. and blood triumphs. When the nest builder announced his plans for the next piece, the group saw a part. Why is it always your piece we asked? When he offered us the opportunity to create our own parts and be taken even angrier, who was he to give assignments and set deadlines? The truth was that we lacked the ability to invent our own roles. This led to a climatic shouting nurse wherein we exhausted all our analogies and started all over again from the top. We're not your puppet to your little train dogs, really good jokes. do some food. What do you think what puppets? Is that what you think? Do I look  a puppet to you? I'm not a puppet or a little dog. I'm not going to jump through any of your hoops puppet master because I'm not a dog or a puppet. You can train a dog. Why yourself are dog-wise? Better yet get a puppet because you pull these drinks for the last time. I hope the group might stick together for years but within ten minutes it was off. all over, finished. Each of us pledging to perform our honor own. I spent the next few weeks running the argument over and over in my mind, picturing a small dot chasing the pop at a cost of floor of an abandoned warehouse. I was stuffing the pillow with my cigarette butts when the museum called inviting me to produce a bait in their month of Sunday's performance festival. Watching the performances in my former colleagues, I got the idea that once you assemble the requisite props the piece would come together on its own. Dear a late-able shark led naturally to the puddle of heavy cream which is lapsed in the floor with the slow steady position could amount up to 20 minutes of valuable stage time. This revelation led me to a second hand store where I searched the aisles with the cold eye of a prospector. Standing at the checkout town with an arm load of sock monkeys, I told the cashier, these are for a piece I'm working on. It's a performance commissioned by the art museum. I'm an artist. So is my niece, the woman stabbed to cigarette into it. a bottle full of sand. She's the one who made those monkeys! It disturbed me to hear the word artist who's so loosened. The man who sketched portraits of the mall called himself an artist, that's the woman who forged reads out of you, started from cops. Yes, I said, but I'm a real artist. The woman who's not offended only puzzled. But my nausely is up in the away's asylum. She said it is we're referring to a well-known art capital where the streets were lined with galleries and pastry shops. She's a big one headed girl between babies. Maybe  her in nameslusee, but everybody calls her sock lady on account. She's always making those monkeys. Pretty girl. Fat in the rear, but just as pretty and talented as she can be. I looked into this woman's face. Maybe one day I'd do a piece about stupidity, but right now I just pay for these sock monkeys. Snort a few lines of speed and finish and start in the bullet and go fast. started to use flashlight batteries. It was a good sized crowd gathered at the art museum and I stood before them wishing they were half as high as I was. I'd been up for three days and nights and taken so much speed that I could see the individual atoms pitching in to make up every folding chair. For the first few minutes I thought it was my pair of noia until I remembered that these people were staring at me for a reason. I was here to perform. The show wasn't over yet, it hadn't even started. I tried reminding myself that I was in control. All I had to do was open my pot bag and rest of the piece with two tears itself. I'm slicing the pineapple now, I thought. Next I'll rip apart these soft monkeys and put the stuffing into this tall rubber boot. Now I'll snip off some of my hair with these garden shears. Stare it my hands for a while. and then we're almost home. I moved towards the audience and was dealing in the aisle the shears to my head when I heard. I can't get him to touch the damn things at home. It was my father speaking in a loud voice to the woman seated beside him. I could never get him to cut his hair either. I guess the barbershop is an orgy enough for him. The audience began to last. For the first time since I started, they perked up and began enjoying themselves. Hey, sport, what are you, Charles? It was him again and once again the crowd responded. They're laughed or egg him on and he proceeded to deliver a running commentary. Drunk at attention he ruined my piece of this night's little comments. I was literally spitting tacks trying my hardest to concentrate. Immediately following the performance a sizable crowd gathered around my father. Congratulations, man. Just a delivery and time-consuming. Including your father as an excellent idea the curator said, handing me my check. The piece really picked up on TV lacks and started making fun of yourself. Not only did my father ask for a call of the money, but he also started calling the suggestions for future pieces. What if you were to symbolize man's and humanity demand by heating up a skillet of plastic soldiers? I told him it was the lamest idea I'd ever heard in my life in the stop, calling me understand as to what people need to understand through so many glyce PCR Read your Meinung ideas, I'm an artist I yelled, I come up with the ideas, not you, me, this isn't a party game, it's serious work and I'd rather chew on blasting caps and listen to any more of your suggestions. There was a brief pause before he said, the bit what the blasting caps just might work. Let me think about it and get back to you. My performing career effectively ended the day in my drug dealer moved to Florida to enter a treatment center. How can you do that? this to me I asked her, I have a piece to finish damn it I'm an artist and I need to know what my drugs are coming from. I cash in a savings bomb left to me by my grandmother and use the money to buy what I hope to be enough speed to last me through the month. It was gone in ten days and with it went my ability to do anything but roll on the floor and crawl. Speed's breath taking high is followed by a crushing suicide low. Thinking I surely must have dropped a grain or two I vacuumed the entire amp partner to stop. my nose, sucking up dead skin cells, comment residue, and pulverized tat litter. Anything that traveled on the bottom of the shoe went up my nose. After a week I left my bed to perform at the college, deciding at the last minute to skip both the twister game and the marches to top monies. I just heated up the skillet of plastic soldiers, poured a milk shake over my head. And call it a night. Thank you.

Music Coming up, use of artists in the art world that I swear are not quite so deep. Also, with the theme of the art music, I just can't. And more, it's a minute from the creative animation. We will fit in嬉 To some American life in our class, each of our programs courses is a theme in what part of variety of ideas and ideas and ideas and performance to care to be a theme to this program, blame it on art, stress by the difficulties in editing the same way the slides. We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, River. I will wait to ask one of them at his father, and if we can talk to him, he'll be able to use our DIVs of Teams on doing his treatment, and especially after he stood up in sides, and used in music. He said it here that he's dead and he instrumented the top. It was music's past, it was nothing. But he could never understand why other musicians not frustrated when he ended up Brand-Mural Range and his logo was there. He could always play it right off the page, but I couldn't name. I don't know what he got to hear his father's music for the first time. What's happened since his story about what it means to be a nobody on his. And what means to be called the genius. This American wife produced an antiseptic system. When I was first heard his father's music, it was 19th century. 26, two years after his dad was killed. His father, Rod Keith, fell or jumped from an overpass onto a telephone highway at 5 in the morning. Elere was 17 when he first heard the tape. The talented and earnest jazz saxophone player living with his mother who is also in musician. I think we are just sitting in the living room in one of the other's house, involved in the situation. And perhaps not surprising me when I was first heard this performing, who was really disappointed. He hadn't known what to expect in his grandparents' sense of tape, but after all the buildup, he just couldn't believe that this was the beat in his father and the genius. One happy tape he couldn't see in this routine. And that was the last time his father's music he heard for the late 15 years. Let's play... I'm just placing it. This is called a hippie-hooking man. This is a song poem. Song poems are songs built around lyrics that keep a send-in to companies that advertise in the back of singing magazines. They're supposed to send in your lyrics and then they'll write a song for you to record and send it out to record companies. so you can break into the biz. He goes to say the song poem, Industries about half a promise short in the Strindle and not a form whose launch in the musicians do or I could name. Except, interestingly enough, who do you, a Korean in the flow finish? Just kidding. So it's 15 years since Alice first heard that David is dead and he's summing through his music catalog and this is a CD compilation of song themes. Thank you. He once by ride Keith, his father, who was stunned. He immediately got the CD and started finding out everything he heard about other song promises that he needed. It turns out he wrote hundreds and hundreds of them. Now, Eley is a poor shelf of 45s for song poems he's doing. This music has everything in the world going against it. It's completely artificial. It's a scam. It's, , I could probably list 15 different reasons why it shouldn't work. But for some reasons. something who's still on this stuff and I think that's probably charming track of this that it is. The combination of the sentiment of the lyrics and tune. Ding Soems? I'm sure coupled with rods delivery which is actually  his don'ts. I mean it's  a fine line between  the fact that he knows if this is kind of a joke but he's really kind of  put something in it. , and a lot of this stuff is right on that line. I think that's  almost an uncomfortable place to be but it's really fascinating and attractive. It's  you want to cringe but you're laughing but you really are attracted to it all at the same team. That's what I'm talking about. I love that Ron is in confusion with song poems and not in a theoretical or is not teaching me. He likes listening to him. This is a put on the song poem CD, just a listen to around the apartment. It's the same as in the other CD. Which may sound unimaginable on breast duty. But here's the thing, when you listen to one song poem after nothing, you realize songs are  a blind date you start out with a team to defeat. And then by the end of dinner in the movie, you sound several things and you really don't have to listen to it. And even if you're not in marriage, you definitely not even have to listen to it. Did you ever try to find a way as a trickles in the doors? If you ever try to catch a little bit of fun, it's trickling spars. But try to find a way that goes by power in its life. This place is only lost in where it's come from in the night. And so it is with feeding loves, they start to flow wild. Look all to some lady, do you want your senses to be wild? And so it is with feeding loves, they sparkle for a while, but all to assume they need you on your senses to be tired. As we listen to the curtain made that I had never heard of fireflies, I used to remember for some love for some time. Also great thing about S song poem, every metaphor. Every mixed metaphor that you could imagine is in there in the topics of great, , there's  politics love songs, hippies Dance crazys do the pig do the turkey Space travel Not a dance really made it big I don't have that answer It would have this if this had gotten me Of all babies, all of them deserve this. Of all babies, the thing you really did. In stylistic range in the song, the hardest part of the road is dizzying. It's ten years of work from something who is very, very productive. Of course, it was always working because sometimes he was busy doing things  taking LSD in Dornyard on Sun. at Bovarn, working on your raincoat and then accidentally touching the raincoat and fire when they tried to get a cigarette and then taking the raincoat off and being restless to public nudity. But when he was working, he would report, say, 30 songs a day. One right after another, know of her soul's no second taste. So Rod would report, maybe some James Bond theme from his other song, was a dark or rainy night. Thanks for watching! To the round five stands back to the back To the dancing, so the clock number The big love All the stars All the stars All the stars All the stars something that sounds  good early bea dance in the red babies I I've spent all my days, just a little years I was the first one when I was first listening to those records. I was here things and not be sure it was him even to his name and name. It's only it's it ticked it well now I can tell it's him no matter where he's doing I can tell whatever that mean of whatever that is his voice that needs to hear  I can tell. It's amazing right and no one will find you that you have this sort of musical intimacy with me that mean nothing. sound fast to feel? Yeah, that's true. I can almost tell the sounds that he wrote to just by the devices that he used in the chord changes,  little small little things. That's Ellery in the Sats. It's from his first album, which is a collection of jazz standards. But this father on the other side of the country, that's the music Ellery throughout this into anything. I used to be not a snob-a-long because I've always heard very broad tastes in music, but I definitely just brought up feeling that there was good music in music. I mean, I do not  in rock and rock, which is very interesting. Every kid in the first grade just talking to the Beatles and getting to hear the drum and I'm thinking about  Stan Getsler and John Colson listening. By the time Valerie heard his father's music the second time he was in his early 30s. His musical taste had already changed and broadened. But the song poems were just a different world, all to doubt him. They were so unsettered by any potentials of the argument, whether world is serious music. It was inspiring. L'Ali says in the last few years since finding this father's music in the Skyrim Song poems, he's been having a ball by music to deliver light and have a bird as a kid and discovering who loves it. He'd be pop, get up and leave. In L'Ali's own music is changing. Frankly, it's getting weirding. Much less  jazz standards and much more  song poems. They have this experimental. Hey, let's see how this sounds. He's making him a jazzed outcast these days, which is fine with him. When a reviewer sniffed at a section one piece album sounded  quote, the buzzing of a thousand-demented insects. His reaction was, yeah. Priv assurance. disappointment something that you had to sort of go through and get over to think, okay, , , my father isn't is a Mozart jazz, , he's not damn it. I'm not related to culture and related to I don't know what I think I have related to. I mean the music didn't change them. Now people have told them, I mean they use exactly the way they're doing. He's , he knows nothing about it. So he can do it. So he can do it. I mean all the clichés, but one people. I can tell that they really haunts him. So my estimation, my father, has never waved and I've never been disappointed in him. I've only been disappointed in the fact that I've never been able to find more of what he was able to do, not that I'm dissatisfied with the song from music and all. I'm thrilled to have it. It's just that I know that there was no one's personality and there was no one in his life. I'm not dissatisfied with the song. I started out with almost nothing to go on except for that one cassette in two pixels. That was all. I mean, if you could have a conversation with me, I wouldn't be able to do so. Obviously there's no anything to know. I just think it would be being with him that would be a healthy him. Not unlike these dreams in which he's here, we're together and we're doing new key stuff. We're going to go out and do this. We're going to do that. And now I got caught a huge amount of attention to the fact that it is this profound in me. you will miss this thing that one will not know that you would be able to who is gonna press that some of you should understand you can want to understand I'm telling you the previous slide Because I guess, up to now, we just talk in terms of... Second hand stories, things that I've thought a lot of that I'm able to recite, and have said many times before that I've thought about a lot in familiar with, I've been able to regulate my... to breathe, mercy, to... But even if you ask me to indulge in fees and something will be a thing, it will be a thing. We do everything. He never met his father. He's not just a few died. He never met him. Ellery says he losing his father, he's only done hard at the same time, boredom. When we talk, he'd just pass the age as father was a new dad, there was something. Ellery's father appears in all his new album. and do this. About half the song, the same thing was written by his father and some other song comes too.

But now, 25 years after his death, he represents him with his work without a new life in it. The sci-fi stories in novels of spawn or in films, in astonishing news. films, the Adeland, a total recall from Matrix, an audio form between the machine, a scanner darkening. Approaching his writing is now in the library of the American, in the company of Twain, Whitman, Raw. I think most of us  that,  Fib, Dick, and Ellie's father, most of us are touring the way a daily work. It doesn't seem as important to us as the ambitious dreams we have for our saves. For convinced that we're not living up to our potential, but there's a better part of... The clones tha get their power on it. We'll have these primitive, mear... That's being all I believe is listening to the dots of these long memories to這個 grThe agreement that comes to me in the zoalsia free. But I dream long woke up to late. That's what Grace knew. Tenor program on a more hopeful note we have this story from Joel Costney. We do tell some of the bitterness that we hear from others, and I'll see if I decide what about the life of artist, plus some of this we're thinking. To climate is a rock, Smith in New York City! This is my... book of spaces that need bad experiences for me. Musician is a Pina, he says. The musician sits on a chair and talks to me while he works. He's wearing a nice, iron, white, short-save shirt and pair of green chinos. His hair is black, black with gray. It's short and neatly combed. Yeah, he says. Nothing but a damp tea. He lives in a tiny, one-room apartment and a Nathan Manhattan Bridge. Things will arrive. head. Sometimes the noise is so loud and difficult to hear what he's saying. I never should have gone to jewelry already so it really messed up my perspective. He stands and walks over to the kitchen which is a sink in your half refrigerator. There's a hot plate sitting on the counter beneath a homemade shelf when we have some cups or stacked next to a few plates. Two saucepanes hang from hooks from the shelf. Bring your own special little classical world then. not the real world, musicians don't rate in real world. Took me years to get that straight. The alpins to be a fridge room and the moves of pitching. You want some iced tea? No thanks, I say. You pours a glass for himself. All I ever really wanted to do was play pop-in music and says that I was just a kid. What did I need? Julia, I was my parents and my dad. I came all the way from Hawaii. Luckily I was smart enough to drop out. What did students do just to be here? guitar. Lowit really bugs me. What? Americans can play the line of guitar. They only copy me. I've already figured out what's wrong with his law. It'll be an easy repair so I allow myself to opportunity to continue the conversation. , there was a hit song when I was a kid. It came out in the 50s. It was called the Lion Loveson. Something. It was an instrumental with the line of guitar. It was the singing level of what I've seen this day now. Right musicians, Americans, that was typically the big hit Hawaiian guitarist who was done by Americans, John. And that song came out though there was a lot of work for us. We spent years on the road playing Hawaiian music. Spent some great days in Kansas City. Have you ever been there? No. Nice to meet you. Great time. Have some fun. In the last few days, the musicians first class gig all the way didn't last long, harder times than if they were there. We hear the sound of an instrument coming from outside, when the musicians frowns and walks to the window, and staring to show the around in this glass, I look to. There's a guy leaning up against the car, playing a saxophone. He thinks he can play, he seems. him? The musicians sit just to, unforging the old, he says. He will no good music be choked of him. The saxophone of seven ways. You are most ready because in the musician else, be flat in the steps back into it. He says, what an idiot, he needs the same mistake at the time. I'm almost finished here, I see. Take your time, he says, we're only going to stop him. The wedding's not off three. He's not paying enough to get her early. I'm engaged in the marriage, I see. The answer is back on how hard the class of the trio to play it out in. So you and the band, , musician laughs to yourself. It's not a chance. It's the type where I've seen. Every time it's the type where it gets said, he calls me to bail him out. The true email is gone. He cups and plates shit. I'm a bar to you. I think it's a chance. So you finally ready? The sax player asked, he's sitting on the hood of the car holding his instrument between his legs. No, the musicians are on his legs. I just came down from the guitar to tell you he didn't have any feelings. The good for six kids is standing a few feet away watching. Two Chinese girls, three early adolescent black girls, and they were a white boy who couldn't be moving forward. They look  they are posing for a family picture, tallest in the year, a little one in the middle, everyone waiting to say, cheese, friendly die, huh? The sax player is in his den. You see, only a reason I give me chance to go on these gigs, because it's such a nice die. You can't play a leg, right, in musicians' youth. The sax player is middle age for the salt and pecking go to. He's wearing a small black cap, between teeth and seagull worms, and the snap. in the front over the dream. Get the lock fixed? Yes. Yes. Listen. He lifts the horn to his lips and begins to play. I recognize the melody. Go into the chapel and move on to the ground. I wonder if we can get the classic of tree over here in the distance. One of the Chinese girls. This is about nine and ten starts clapping, to hold the palms of her hand straight up a singles, and ultimately doing his one down onto the wall. The rest of the group joins in. Each one moves differently one to sway, one lifting and dropping her shoulders to the beat. The sax player slides off the car and holds the instrument out forward in while he plays. They start to dance around him. He hops up onto the side when the kid's father, his surface of the car and the kids in breathing, hoping for him to hold the pitch there hide. I really love you, and we're gonna get more and more on you. We are not blocking you, because I have nowhere in the steaming of you, because I see you. She has what sounds to me  a profession of voice, in the musician lines in smiles of you. Going into the chapter with love, she couldn't listen. People on the sidewalk, across the street, stop and be done clapping too. The train goes by and we've gotten bored directly above us. The kids are still dancing, the people who clapping. The Saxony and his plume, but all I think he was the train. After that 15 settings, the noise subsides, and I heard a sound at the guitar. The musician with one foot up on the finger of the car, is playing the rhythm to accompany, this smiles at me. The Saxony player comes up and stands next to him. They pick up the pace, and the people are clapping fast and fast. Finally. While the saxmen is playing the string of cascading notes, the musician strumming furiously lifts his guitar finger into the invins of down with a chop. They end up with so many pieces, we all applaud and enthusiastically. Okay, let's go to the wedding music series. Jail costumes but the piece to the city, two thousand new episode of Oxford.

This music has everything in the world going against it, is completely artificial. It's a scam. And, , we started today's program with me and the vintage, it's in the left me and the little as well. That's the quarter music. To the ambitious, whom neither the bounty of life need to be the world's suffice to contend, it comes as penance, as life for them is haunted. And that they possess neither the benefits nor the beauty of the world. And if they are unable to perceive what is divine in nature, is all around them? How will they be able to see the round of enemy? You just sometimes hidden. I'm Eric Glass, back next week, in most stories of this American life."
