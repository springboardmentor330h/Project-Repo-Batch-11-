  "text": "You can leave the easy shot of public radio information It's a Americanite, my request. Hello, I'm Paul Wallan. You see the world you're sitting in right now is a completely different world than the one I'm sitting in recording this message. An event the Bible calls the rapture as taken place and millions or even billions of people have vanished from the face of the earth, including myself and all of the men you're going to see on this video today. while we can't begin to imagine what the world you're sitting . sitting in right now must be , we cannot at least say we knew this was going to happen and we can't answer many of the questions that are so important to you right now. This is video called Left Behind and it exists to solve a problem. In the view of Evangelical and fundamentalist Christians who try to understand the prophecies in the album, we as a species run the verge of some terrible events, events of a last year in the end of time, in return of Jesus to the earth. For the very first thing that will happen, let us start at least. because these Christians come to the Bible. These are the key Christians who be lifted away to have an innocent. To be the heart of the Ratchet. This video and others  it are designed to explain to those left behind exactly what's heard. And what happens after the Christians are not gone. I was so, that there's a lot of fear. There is a lot of tension. I would assume that newspapers are speculating as to the disappearance of millions and millions of people on planet Earth. You are one. What's going to take place next? I would refer you to the Bible. The Bible is a spiritual world. Well, the true believers have just been taken out of those crazy Christians just to tell you that they were. And they've all been suddenly without wanting to snatch doubt to make Christ in the air and they've been changed from modeled in one. Much of this video tape is a warning. It says that after the Christians of Anish there will be seven years of tribulation in false prophet. the city price. The city tries to warn us against all of the lies that the anti-Christ would tell but it's very tricky business because the people putting together the video tape do not know what exactly the lies will be. And as we sit and ponder that we think about it the rupture took place in the world in which we live today the one frame of reference that most people would have for this event came from something that's been very popular in this world for the last decade or so it's called Star Trek and it's called the Transporter being being made up of star. So stories will begin to its explode that people have been taken off this planet on UFOs that they've been sent to other planets to slave planets or that they have just been brought up to UFOs for some reason or another. This is simply not true according to the scripture, it is alive, but we know it's forthcoming. There's a kind of left behind industry, turning out private right now. The series of novels about what will happen after the rapture during the years of tribulation by the Bible, is crossed over the American Christians in the Song of Dios. to the mainstream charts. Let us focus on the series as a number seven on the New York Times and the systems. So half million copies in this first two weeks. The other core books in the series, plus the videos in this week. Audio books, plus the special series about the end-time for young people caught left behind in kids. Together, we're so about six million copies according to the condition. And if you don't think people in your life, we even these promises just ask around. And in front of all the people who work at this. public radio station. We speak to you from right now. It can be easy in Chicago. Nine people ought to be 55 that we ask, so they do believe in the biblical prophecies to rapture into infant. And yet, this is an area where we're just people and secular people definitely do not see, I'd . Secular non-Christians usually do not take these religious seriously in the hour today. We try to demonstrate why they should. It's subject today, the end of the world. one. How boys are the apocalypse?

And one day he was saying that combined his dreams, by entrite redbatten in the New York movies, he was going through the Bible and looking for all the references about cows. Of, , the early books of the Bible are essentially about an agricultural people, so there are a lot of references about cattle. And when he came upon numbers 19. found this reference in God, this speaking to Moses. God commanded that Moses told us people to bring him of the headhunter, without spot or boomed, he never been sacrificed to him. And I began to wonder where they might have gotten such a thing off, because all of the cattle that he could find referenced in the olden season were spotted or frightened. But what he also with that. There's a breed of cattle called red angus. This is red as an Irish cedar and it seems to be unknown in Middle Ages So struck him, but he might be the very man who could bring the red head back to land of Israel There's an important reason Kaldalat might be in do-no and that reason about stable prophecy Kaldalat's reading of the Bible and many people said Second common of Jesus and getting raptured thousand year reign Jesus on earth, all this will occur only after three things have. Number one, establishments of the state of Israel, number two, Jerusalem has to be in Jewish means. Number three, the in-gen Jewish temple in Jerusalem, the temple that was destroyed in 7980, that temple has to be rebuilt and re-established as the center of Jewish worship. Number one and two are present, come to pass in the last few decades. To be established in Jewish temple, somebody would first have to pure. to verify the ground to the temple and then they would have to purify the temple itself and to do that according to the Bible, somebody would have to sacrifice the pure numbers 19 red happen, without spotted lunch. Where would it call  that? I've got to turn the question over and over in this head. Until one day, he was in the making room. Well he was out, maybe he was a sailor bro. He even started going to town to get a new part, new founding. himself he said driving instead of Jackson's is a big capital and walking to the Department of Agriculture. I can remember walking in this office straight out of the hate field. This is Connephine. This Bluegees Walmart tennis shoes baseball count dirty smelling, hay and grass all over me grease on me and asking the question or stating the fact and then asking the question where did Israel get their red calphum? You seen this on Spot. what was just about? It was , well, you're the third person in here today asking this. No, they looked at me for several minutes before you realized that I was serious. The official realized Mr. Vatt was serious. He helped him write a letter that made its way from one US government officials to the city. To finally respond to a private organization in Israel, and the temple in Situ. The temple in Situ is run by very religious Jews, whose goal is that you might explain it to you. reestablished the ancient Timber in Jerusalem. You want to do this because it's the belief of some Jews that to be truly Jewish, you have to obey all the commandments in the Bible. And it turns out that about a third of those commandments are specifically about things that happen at that original temple. Awesome. Many Orthodox Jews believe that the Messiah, the Jewish Messiah, who's been waited for Mugheni, cannot arrive into the Timber's new building. And it turns out that the rabbis and the Timberants, who did, had been pondering the question of generals, who is dead after theumenach matron... is only due when around here and in general when Jedeелов wanted the originalYchluu to introduce, , the originalHeith, POW does everyone still alright? She plays new skill and maybe she existed before the kind of transformation anymore. Also I say, the R副 review technician finds out that Orphy Kan wordt, who supports UNI am still listening to this! And he goes all through the Hippungung team called they were going to find the numbers 19 red pepper without permission spot. That's an actually they were very interesting. The octopus and mine, after some letters and found the meat, grew to meet with them in Jerusalem. But they put into motion was a project that now in class doesn't speak about here's cattlemen, many Christian and Jewish donors, and very high-tech 20th century breeding techniques are to create a red end that would conform to biblical law and also fly with the Middle East. In very stark cutelatses, they found the head of God's Park Mountain, though come. from his partner, Mississippi, he had a really talking. And meeting with Rabbi Oriel, meeting with Rabbi Oriel, we began to talk about producing Cal, Red Cal, Sport Numbers 19, and Rabbi Richman was interpreting for Rabbi Oriel, and one of the things that he asked was, how many Cals did we think it would take to produce a Numbers 19, and we told him we thought. that it would take approximately 200 years. And what was amazing there, then, was they asked as how much they thought it would cost. And we tow Rabar Richman $2,000 a year. And he turned the Rabar Yel into 20 fast. There was a mistake. So, then that didn't do. Yes, yes, he was speaking Rabar Yel into 20. And you can imagine the next few minutes got pretty excited before in those. to rob us because that was quite a sum of money when you figure two out of here, twenty thousand dollars a year. And after several minutes of listening to them, talk back and forth, we interrupted Rob Arrechman and we asked him what the problem was. And he told us that he said, the twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money for his house. And we made the statement. And said, simply this, we're not trying to take it to define it for you. to come back to go. And they were astonished because there was a terrible Jewish tradition about the Gentile who I was a Jewel and a Jewel who called on out of the vests of the chief rabbi and the delegation went down to this Jewel who was supposed to replace this precious stone and They asked him how much the cost of a place, he said it's 100 shakmas. But he couldn't replace it, present because the box, the precious jewels, was under the bed where his bottoms were in one disturbance. And they thought that was a rule, so they raised the price, doubled it, and doubled it. Finally, he got up to 1000 shakmas, and he's still in for his delegation left there in England. Shortly thereafter, going to the story, Dr. Venetty. the father will retrieve the jewel and ran down the road and gave it to the priest and they had turned gave him the thousand checklists and he gave him back 900 correctly the price to 1-10 the same thing that we did and soon as he backed the 900 checklists he made the statement that I'm not trying to take advantage of you as you seek to turn it out. Work for work the same thing its time for $20,000 Right there on the road, the priest of the temple, prairie day, blessed over this blessed more than all of this jet-pound engine one day would come to the finish of the year it happened. So the rabbi of the temple, so a way of striking similar to the point, to really put a lot of way to unscap, insulation. with me. Do you want to see me? I have the one here. What I believe is, there's a real thing. How about God? We do not see the one. So when you first announce me the foundation. We hope possibly as early as night. not me, we should have  it would be about how much of it. And how many casks is going to be in that first piece? We look at flower, we look at flower, we look at 300 yen per hour, and 15.2.0. And then you said to them, they're just, we're kind of named as a 7.4. There are number of planes that are black and we are working with a 7.4. , that's not the only group of cows. And there's a there's been cattle that have been there. it's as well. So I think the chances of a red-happermint born in Israel meets all the arms within the next several months is good. It's long. I can't stress to strongly what a catastrophic inward way can be better than that. Who be catastrophic as well as well? Because once it was red happen, using crystal could certainly start agitating in the rebuilding the ancient Jewish temple. The next cave part. The small portion of the temple still exists in the usual today, the western wall you can see at the previous. But to rebuild the temple in the original form, it's original site, which is the only thing that will be acceptable in the ancient soil. Most people believe that you have to tear it down too holy as on its sides and stand near fois and walk. their axiomas and then rock. The film of the rock is the oldest building of Islam, and one of its holy ascents, Muslims believe that this front, this front, and calm, is in the capital of New Zealand's deep. I think that this extreme mountain, the one of two of these in the mountain, because some religious groups were also seen, destroying, or severely damaging one or both of the or else the stream of religious and political that is so ascendant in Israel. Now we're gaining enough power to decide to remove the marks and the rest of the team. Now I think it would be more moderated with the name of the Master. consegu even no religious war such as between scenes and situations . Well, no, it has looked up to that very last sentence. It's, I can't underscore too strongly, , since the situation moves. And then, how jealousy, the Muslim authorities, darkness, just a few years ago, , there is a, there's a good tunnel, no one's wrong. side to him. He's a tourist, he can go walk along and see what's in his mouth. Quite beautiful stones in the fashion room. The prime minister is not really decided to extend them. It's not also a bit because they walk all over the area. Not doubling them down. So people have to pass favor, not to the school. That, the surface will drive us such. especially that we arrive all over the world. Just to build this stuff. Just to open the tunnel to the street. 90 people died. 90 people died. We've been accused of the chaos being over this. We're three years in the world. I'm trying to have even been to you playing at a cost. Wow. Do you think you were interested in one of these things that you can often know once Red happens or we need to do two as well. That it can be divided into two. This is a faith wall, which is, and when we commit our lives to a walk of faith, we are committing our mistakes. trust in God, to do with us as He see gifts, to accomplish His needs. So from that standpoint, I have never been worried about the outcome because I know beyond the shadow of the doubt that the outcome is going to be the outcome that God wants. Do you  it at the time of view? Well, we as Christians all should. or exercise, this kind. We put this incredible statistic, hold on to the article we've seen that about half. 46% of our Americans, believe it the state of Israel's existence and its being held by Christians, is the confirmed got passed. Right. It's not just funding, but it's not a lot of, I know a lot of people who cannot be sick. The leguadens Larry has got a greatkress through his most conservative extend of the Fe różnych base. These say all those names feature. Not on Maryland support through zero to zero. The Jewish spot! the population in the most states is not that significant, but the fundamental is Christian, even in general Christian population is a substantial. And especially in southern states, states were senators  Latin, Helms and so on, and had traditionally been great allies in terms of vision. It's not because there are a lot of Jews in my team. And then... Mayans and Mayans and Christians give money to support Israeli causes Jewish causes because they believe that this is where the end times were unfolded. And they have a genuine heart-self-belief that this should happen and that it should be a part of a mental policy that's been wrong. And indeed it is. So that's the news. How do ? How do ? I just turned 43. Do you believe that you will see the rapture in the end? I think so. I think his fastest of this or on moving in the, I would, in the reason I say that is, I'll be moving again this project. years ago. It seemed  we began at a very slow walk and then it got a little fast and it got a little fast and it got a little fast and it got a little fast and it got a little fast to report now where we still we're almost running. And then if you Bible we feel there in this year you're talking to me in this city and this is from Austin, Austin. Is there any passage in the Bible that you look to the screen as you do this well? There's a number of pictures. One of them comes to my nail. I'm telling you, it's not music yet. Check the video. Say, therefore, say it to them. That's say it below. There's she, another of my words, people along. Me, more. But word, which I have spoken, she'll be done. Say it to me on both. And... What that is speaking to me is that God is going through the earth we work with. The years there have been religious needs to try to blow up with you. We are donor together to relax and shout out to God in a hopeful way with God. This is really the reason. The Jewish extremists use it, It's felt in the Jewish one by the Israeli and the God, the Israeli, the Muslim, it was time to hear. When you talk about the denabity of this concept, over what we've done with this sign. The phrase South of the Olympophysic, this is the thing that keeps coming to my mind. It just seems , , they have a prophecy about the world and the power. because they have it, including all the elements in the place, so they can have this huge argument over this religious site that could turn violent, so simply and quickly. Well, they welcome, because that's pathetic, because it's so, fulfill my dog's own policy. So it brings on their popular, which is exactly what they expect. And moreover, from the Christian point of view, they're going to be rapsured in Alice. here before that actually happened so we got nothing to lose. Alright, it's right at the New Yorker and coming to Hyde Lot. And any of you with first broadcast in April 1989, we've tried repeatedly to reach Hyde Lot and the organization to check and whether they've successfully hung Kowski Israel, we've got a red happy there by now, but didn't get a call back at the time I've hidden all the lies from you Needless that付 thank all the last time Come on Don't forget I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It's a question. This is a true story. People Christians who devoted themselves to studying the Bible's pasties that they needed in Jesus, which we need. The story that people were tried to get in the way that match when it's in the Bible's. But how US government officials did not understand what they did was going, because 70 for them, 20-1-6, when they raided their company and handled their Miantes disticted. That was it in the podge. in April 19th in 2018. James Taylor is a religious professor at the University of New York, Carolina, New York, Charlie. He's not only followed the intricacies, what the groups leader did for us saying, all the wrong things, processes. They precious final days when he wanted to release his team to the world explaining what he saw as the sighting news in his reading of Scripture. Taylor was one of the two who did his experts for us when he could give the 90s 15. He recedes with the exact same time as a tragedy of misunderstanding. FBI agents start parish never discussed issues of substance abuse. This was always talking to the people who buy building new clinicians. But the choruses were talking about the vibral required was it's means position not the new issues. By rolling the tanks and health, this computer says, the government unwittingly convinced them to punish this one voice. Perhaps the Bible wanted to die and what he showed on me. It's only been the head and belief for him. I think the misunderstanding of the biblical, adjusting their political and using those... not the right appears. as far as was at the heart really of the whole tragedy. , I don't think it needed to have ended that way. One of the things we write is that the government demanded that they surrender to proper authority and that one means the video and so that they heard something very different than what was meant. What did the video and so on? Yes, in fact, on the last day,  the tanks were inserting the tear gas all morning to the building on a loudspeaker there was a report. played over and over in this is not an attack. We want you to come out with your hands up. Come out on our surrender to properly. That was the last public word spoken to the victims before the fire. From the video incident here. It simply meant never, never, that we come out under those sorts of circumstances. Because obviously they were using that that we always believe in this guy. and then David and his leader and then Prof. So it was just a complete process of wires. Even one of the things that that was usually said is being one of Muslim flammatory things in public about the existence of his story. The fact that he had children from some many different women, even that there was a structural reason. Yes, it's something a little difficult. to just perform, I think in terms of the culture, that David did believe that he was in last and final and true property, that has sent to the world. This final figure is Oblivion to have these seven wives, which you have, which you raise up 24 to, now, as as that sentence, it's based on all texts, and songs that speak about it. and the one that is who will be getting some of them in the mentions as wise. By explaining, I think we don't intend to endorse it, but the point I would make is that if you're going to deal with it instead of calling him a polygamous child molesting sex maniac understand how they were going to be all of these women in the area. understood. Soon as Tiber is the author of the teaching calendar as he goes, why wait a cult in the battle for religious freedom in the United States? Coming up, make friends and visit minds of the problems of 20th century socialism. I'll be visiting the end of the world. It's in the end. In public radio international. May not put. To American Night, I'm gonna replace each other in a private room of course we choose a theme, bring the variety of different kinds of stories on that theme, today's show, being the world. Today's program was first broadcast in 1999, in the first half of our show, we heard about things that we should worry about when it comes to the apocalypse. In this half, another sound strange to say, this half of the show is all about how the end of the world can be, good thing, how it can be a good thing. things, and realize the people who think that a lot of time. We arrived at a three of our show and agreed again. We have this story from our consuming editor Sarah Gau. Whenever I hear people talking about the end of the world, I think the apocalypse, again, how it goes so far is to say that the end of the world and event which has not happened is the most important event of my life. I've been there, not once, not twice, but three talents. in report while the actual end of the world will of course involve a lot of whale in the gnashing of tea. Thank you about the end of the world can be kind of a cliff deep. Populips 1, 1970s. I've had this recurring dream since I was six years old. My mother's gone. She is not running errands gone, not at a friend's house gone. She's gone for good, vanished. My sister's still. here, my dad's around. In fact, all the kids and dads and town are present in the county fort, but all the mothers have vanished overnight. That's how I figure out the raptures happen. Only the women are worthy enough with God's grace to get whisked off the heaven. The wicked men and wicked children are left to tough out our beginning on our own. That means my sister and I will have to suffer through the lake of fire, the rivers of blood, and our fathers cook. And yet I am calm. I have my loophole, my get out of tribulation free cart, which I learned about in church. I go to the supermarket, Gibson's, in the scowby, in Bill of Cart with food. At the checkout counter, I line up vegetables by the cash register. The clerk informs me that in order to pay for the food, I must take the mark of the beast. I refuse. Soldiers with machine guns here. They gun me down, my blood spattering all over the salad fixets. Then two. I'm in heaven dead, Harp and Bean. I still have that dream sometimes, and thinking about it now as an atheistic adult, I realize how many things are going on in it, that it is a microcosm of my childhood world. At my church, Brax Pentecostal holiness in Brax Oklahoma, the sermons were about the book of Revelation when I was in first grade. The year I learned to read. So, as the first book of the Bible I ever read myself, not to mention one of the first books I ever read, period. The loophole of that not accepting the mark of the beast comes from Scripture, as does the grocery store setting. According to Revelation 1317, and that no man might buy or sell, say, tea that had the mark or the name of the beast of the number of his name. That number of course revealed in verse 18 is 633 score and 6. 6, 6, 6. The other reason I refuse the Mark in the grocery store is tied up in the fundamental stuff for our over bar coats in the 1970s. Bar coats were thought by many to be the Mark of Beast. Armageddon is kind of a lot to Leonicid. The book of Revelation is verse after verse of dragons and demons and the blood of the Lamb. The typical passage, and the fourth angel poured out his vile upon the sun, and the power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. Mom, can I have another cookie? Right there, I could have done more seven words than last seven seals. But living in eastern Oklahoma, believing in the apocalypse made a lot of sense, I could buy the Cardi deaths in grizzly. details set forth in Revelation because Oklahoma itself was a bit  a landscape. It seemed  half a year we were on tornado watch and the place was literally crawling with snakes. Snakes in my tree house, snakes on the porch, snakes in the yard. Because I was baptized when I was eight in a water-moconstain-infested lake and, as if I wasn't petrified enough, things and drowning being to my bigger fears, sister men whose drinking husband drove up his pick up right after I came up. for air and he started screaming singing. Yeah, we gather up the river. Because our cousin Gary John's wife got shot dead in the head with Gary's own gun by Gary sister's husband who was joking around and didn't know the gun was loaded. Pa-ha. Because the leader of my brownie troop was smashed into a mill and pieces trying to cross the train tracks. Because my grandfather Pa-hael buried another white fit. every few years. Because my other grandfather, Pop-Arson, was at Cherokee, Wort, Doctor, who could tie a string around a ward and bury the string in the ground, and that made the ward go away. Because my grandmother, Pop-Arson, lost her mind one day and couldn't remember my name, though she could remember all the words to bringing in the sheaves. And today we call this Alzheimer's, but back then we called it God's will. Because on Wednesday nights, my mother would drive this ancient witchy with her master, to church, a lady who believed haircuts for women or a sin which did stop her from trimming that mangy white rope dangling off her scalp around 1923, but did not stop her from scamming rides off my mom, a hairdresser. So in such a superstitious town, among such accident prone citizens, revelations seem more  gossip than it goes story. In fact, considering all the random wrath of God around me, Armageddon appeared refreshingly well thought out. So well thought out that it included that escape clause. I was a believer. But there was something stronger than my belief in God. The thing the preacher said that I believe more than anything else I heard at church was that I was a sinner. When I sang amazing grace, the key grace wasn't to hide those promise of redemption, with this, wrench  meat. Even as a 6-year-old I knew I'd never be good enough to get into Heaven. So I seized on the escape clause, the idea that I could refuse the mark of the beast at a grocery store and everything would be alright. I knew I was evil, I knew I couldn't get through life time and hearing today leave virtue. But I was pretty sure I had the guts to stand to me for three seconds of machine gun pain when the time came. This comforted me. You kept me from panicking about the eternal consequences of every child who's trespass. And so even though it's the scariest book, Revelation did more to ease my mind than any other book of the Bible. Apocalypse 2, 1980s. I'm not exactly proud to admit this, but I owe my life to Ronald Reagan. My family moved from Oklahoma to the Pleasant College town, Bozman, Montana, in 19th. in 81, the year Reagan was inaugurated. I was 11. Away from the Bible Belt, my family was forced to attend a non-denominational church about which my mother said, too much teaching, not enough preaching. Religion became an increasingly less urgent part of my life. This did not mean that the end of the world faded from the forefront of my psyche. I merely replaced one of Pop-The-Lips for another. In the early 80s, President Reagan made so many more to find. announcements about the evil empire and his strategic defense initiative. A.K.A. Star Wars and we began bombing in five minutes that I was utterly convinced I wasn't going to get to grow up. What with waking up every morning surprised there was still a world to wake up, too. I was not a particular, we fun-loving high school student. By junior year, 1986, Chernier-Woll, my free time was filled up with doing my homework. and writing orchestra music derivative of my then-hero Philip Glass. Repetitive music predicated on the notion that time perhaps is going nowhere. But then my twin sister, Amy, who had friends and fun and unlike me was an actual human being, told me that some kids she knew from art class were starting an anti-nuclear group. I was immediately excited and pressed. I only knew the kids who liked. me took banch. I thought the art class kids who showed up for the first meeting of what would become you for global peace, for the most glamorous people I'd ever met. They played in rocking roll bands and wrote poetry and didn't eat meat. They had spiky hair and smoked cigarettes and debated whether or not William Burrow's junkies better than his naked lunch. Yeah, yeah, we talked about loops. We were against them. We'd meet every Saturday night at grand mind. We handed up high graphs of Reagan's 1986 federal budget in which defense spending was the biggest slice of pie at Grohl Frieskore parking lots. We got up really early one morning and plastered the school walls with zero-ups posters of a mushroom cloud on which we had scribbled this could happen to you. My biggest moment was probably representing the group on a round table discussion on the local public television channel. The adult said a few mundane things about a senior nuclear policy. before I started screaming. You got to grow up! what it's  to think you're not going to grow up! Do you? You! You! You! You! You! In retrospect, the anti-nuclear part of the anti-nuclear group was the least important thing about it. I've had friends before them, but I'd never had a gang. They ever had a group of people I liked and admired and enjoyed. The anti-nuclear taught me a lesson which changed my life. How to hang out! And the first time Matt Brewer, the coolest boy invited me over to his house and I got there and he and Jimmy Harkin were sitting around listening to Black Sabbath and spray painting Legos Black. I sort of hugged myself contrary to conventional leftist wisdom to nuclear arms. I didn't know  could be that fun. The Pacalips 3, 1990s. Berlin Wallfalls called War Ends and started before. leaving I might live long enough to die of something other than a first-grite Soviet attack or refusing the market to be. Good bye, darkness, my old friend. Ah, the good old days. When I was a kid, the end of the world really was something. New fear, holocaust, the rapture, but they don't make apocalyptics  they used to. Just look at the cheap little cataclysm they're trying to pass off the unsuspecting future folks lately. These kids today and they're why, too, okay. Did they know what it's  to- I think they're not going to grow up, do they? To find out, I traveled to San Francisco. I heard about a community group there, which was organizing for the possible Y2K after math. The good people of the A2K were not the young Silicon Valley computer programmers I'd hoped for. Instead, the group felt very ex-hyphy, very new age, very marin. In part of the evening ended with a woman reciting a co-peep. greater. They broke down in a small group to address specific problems, some pragmatic topics  community preparedness to the less tangible, psychological and spiritual issues. They admit it could be that come January 1st nothing will happen. This is how Y2K differs from previous pop lips. The old ones,  exactly what happened. We just didn't know the date. Y2K, we know the date. It's what it'll have. happened that's up in the air. One woman says that if nothing happens on January 1st, well, at least she had a good excuse to meet her neighbors and have a really good dialogue. Which in a certain sense seemed to be the point. Just  my old church and my old anti-yuk group, they're using the end of the world as a means to meet and greet, planning block parties so they can come up with why to pay contingency plans in their neighborhoods. They were also very idealistic. This is the thing you might not realize about it in the world. They might seem  they're all about fetishizing doom and destruction, but stick around long enough to them to finish their spiel, few people do, I know, and before long they get to a straight-up utopia and finishing up the world. After all, after the biblical tribulation comes the new Jerusalem in a thousand years of peace on earth. The Beethoven II. K. activists said they saw the possible societal shutdown as an opportunity for community built. They talked about how American culture is unsustainable out of... control, optimistically appigning that we brought this fall on ourselves. They're looking forward to a sainer, more agrarian way of life. One of the men said neighborhoods should get together and buy a teller to start community gardens. To them, why two K looks a lot  why one K? I grew increasingly alarmed picture they were painting, a golden picture of neighbor with neighbor throwing off the shackles of capitals. the list to tell the soil at one with the earth. A woman named Leslie said she'd  to help out, but I'm physically challenged so I can't even offer my strength. I can't garden. I'd  to, but I can't. The Tiamma, the man sitting next to her tells her that she could contribute in other ways,  canny. He says, even the know-how of doing it is just as valuable as the manpower or the strength to do it. Each carry according to his abilities, each taking according to. needs. I'm not sure which thing I react to more. This brand of shiny happy Marxism all expressed as if the history of the 20th century never happened or the talk about canning. Just picturing Mason Jarvis Full of Studio Tomatoes a bomb goes off inside me. I suddenly realize what they're proposing. Canning, gardening, spending time with your neighbors. This is Oklahoma. Mine is God. The one thing that gave it all some dignity. There welcome to their millennial vision to whatever gives them hope. I too have imagined a heaven on earth, a new Jerusalem that comforts me in times of tribulation. Behold my revelation. I stand at the door in the morning and low there is a newspaper in sight  unto an emerald. And holy holy holy is the coffee which was and is and is to come. And heart, I hear this. The voice of an angel round about the radio say, since my baby left me, I found a new place to dwell. After this I beheld and low a great multitude which no man can number and shoes. And after these things I will hasten unto a taxi cab and to a theater where a ticket will be given unto me, and low it is a mat nae and a film that do a great wonders. When it is finished we have ends will open and out come with a rain fragrance. or the same as me. there is... by I'mIONIRE. Servants, do you ever take anything with me please sing with me? Alright. Cause I feel  Say I got bad work you've got noise. I'm working with you. Well I'd take some, , I'm just playing Always and always will Let's see if we can go to now Fuck. You talking about to deafel. And then we go, What, it's provider a movie, you heard the clever girl well whatever, the heart of our entire family and it's aower, it's always aower. And we go and do whatever it takes me Way! That you cant hear the train? Way! FOR Now show aclock for your own A lot of apportion by the end of the world again incubator is finally trying to compute when exactly it will happen. We are a nation in many Christians of 30 to exactly them throughout our history. Somebody is trying today is Bonnie Gond, she doesn't jacks in Michigan. Some of the calculations are based on the fact that every Hebrew one corresponds to a number, so the Hebrew text is in the Bible. It is filled with numbers that provide clues to the date in the option in the end. She written nine books about this. Honey Gond also points to scripture that indicate. that the millennium will come in the sixth debacle death. Each debacle day she says is a thousand years and you start counting in the creation of Adam. Counting all the events in the Bible in the sense she basically is discovered the exact death of good Christians with rapture directly to heaven and at the end of the day. I spoke with her back in April 1989. In the end of that time the calculations indicated the exact date of the rapture will be. And is it affected? You may your behavior until the line. Yes, it's very true, such as our house is in desperate need of sighting, new sighting on it. And that might have been said, well, when spring comes, let's put sighting on the house. And I said, well, let's wait for the last September, let's put sighting on the house. If we're not raptured, then maybe the house needs sighting. And there are things  when I get catalogued into my offer clothes and shoes. kind of stuff and I look through the catalog and I toss the catalog down and I say what am I looking in this fall? Where I need new clothes for? I don't need any new clothes came now on the rapture. I don't need any new shoes that you wear what I've got. I would think could also do the other one. You think okay no. after September you're going to be gone so I can have the extra dessert. what I mean? I hadn't even thought of that. I had bought strictly in the other in the other time. That I don't need these things because I'm going to be given something so much better. I guess what I'm attempting to do is prepare for it, but also still prepare to keep on living in case my date is not in case today. I have told my sons, prepared both of my sons for the possibility that their father and mother might disappear. And what would these conversations  to do with sons? I would imagine that if they're not behaviors in the same way that you are, you can do it in the heart conversation. Well, they were very kind and polite to me. What they were really feeling inside was not revealed on the outside. The 38-year-old, when I was telling him all this, he is. a saturday with his big grin on his face and the sparkle and his eye. And I could tell whether he was happy for me because I had such a beautiful hope or whether he was sick or he lashing at me. I don't know. How much of your thinking is it concerned? I think of you. I go out for a walk and I'm talking to God and I am just so anxious to see him and want to be in his realm It's just such a beautiful living hope for me that That hope is with me all day long. I lie in bed at night and think about it and it's beautiful It's a good dej Because people have been predicting the return of the Lord, the centuries. And even the early church. The early church thought he was going to return in their day. So I have people following me. Well, why do you think your day, 10 different than anybody else's day? None of them have ever come through. So how do  yours is going to come through? I don't know who it is. I'm hoping you do these. Now, when AJ was in California,  Bonnie Gont, she studies Bible prophecy and he's tried to compute the name of all the events in the Bible. I figure out one at the end of time it began. She's after a three-boxer in his subject, because it is this pet and plant. Last year, he set a date for the rapture, and he thirty-first. He's the boss. What did you do the day before? You're Mr. Monsichim and I do this. I have a web page app. Call Bible prophecy corner. And I answer it. email, console. I was answering email. And I meant to stay up all night because the Jews stay up all night. And my back hurts so bad. I live in pain. I've had lots of people. So it hurts so bad. I went to lay down just for a few minutes. It's to rest my back and just go back and answer email left by computer on the new computer. And I woke up in my closet and it's morning. I didn't get a chance to stay up all night. I hope I can be better this time. I want to Yeah, I think I really try to stay in there. No, not me. Yeah, Jesus and God. Yeah, they couldn't stay away. Yeah. Not coming either. And I'm not too. I'm not going to meet you. And when you woke up, it was , what was that? What was that? Well, I just knew it didn't happen. So, back to the drawing board. What is there there? What clue is there there that I didn't see? You must have been so, so this phone. Oh, of course, okay. I've been counting on since 1969. But  something, I wasn't passed down, and my faith is so strong. There's no possible way you could infirm that. Love, they can count yet, I would. I think, 7 yet, 10. You didn't use anything in this bathroom? Not much. Things are getting so bad here. And I have so much pain. I think you're on nice of the feet. I haven't had a day, I've had a day, I've had pain since I was 30 years He was in the bed, you're back. Oh, I have muscular spasms, sneaking here in. I was late two times the night with my feet cranking. This last, that it keeps twine eyeing. Motum. It's a weapon wrapped. After rapture, I won't have any more pain. That'll be nice. ... Your own ageig has your capability for acknowledging. since our energy back in 1999. She now believes that the rapture will occur in 10 to 10 years. Which means we can eat. Let's close our program today with this last review pack. In 1880, the farming room. Spend two years studying the scripture, especially a passage in the being that Meryl and Aging is not purchased. Then 840. Lay a milloconcledic news reading that the rapture in the end of the world can happen. in the 18th of the week. Many people who mainstreamed parents can convince their calculations were sound and a whole movement suit. And when 1843 came in when, without the individual, in recap, set a date for 1844, this time the anticipation was even more interesting. Stahar's you study the Netherlands a century later, noted gladly that when people are committed to a set of the loose, clear, contrary evidence may exist in order not to come over note And that's what happened in this place. All of New England, farmers didn't find it. I just planted the Dima harvest. This testimony to the folks that were at the wooden hill. Yeah. And on the appointed date of 22nd, 1843, when the sun rose and set another ordinary day in the middle of it. I'm all right, right. I found this hope's next location to the mosque. It's a to be painting the places of Mother experience. It's in the delas of all earthly friends to be no comparison. We were in the day. on. My ad-rent experience has been the richest and brightest of armour for student experience. To disagree with the failure, what was the rest of the student's experience? Is the Bible put to failure? Isn't it God or Heaven? The Golden Home City may paradise? This is all that's been a seemingly devised paper. Isn't it a reality to a fondest hope and expectation of these things? In thus, it had something to feel. love, never says he wants to hear something. You were just going to end, you were just going to end. Sir, how do you make that work?
