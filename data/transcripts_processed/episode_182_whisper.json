  "text": "The girl worked in the soft school, none that. The office manager, during the nine year old, what? Good kid. The con-complates. And she would just kind of tell about around the office. She would pass mail loud. And over the time that I was there, she and I, bit off this kind of teasing relationship, she would come to my office and she would drop my mail off, stick her tongue out in. That was sort of fake, jacer tongue-mo, or something. That's sweet. Yeah, yeah, she's incredibly sweet kid. And so there's this day when it's early in the morning I've arrived at the office and I go into the bathroom. And when I come out of the bathroom, I have my glasses in my shirt pocket rather than on my head. And I look down this hallway and I see this small person walking towards me and I then get down and start to crab walk towards her. So I go down on my hodges and then And put my hands up as if they're claws, kind of, water, water towards her. And as I'm watering towards her, I say, it's kind of creepy voice. Oh, no, I can't believe you are here today. And then at that moment, as I say today, she comes into focus. And I realize in fact, it's not at all the young girl who I thought it was. That's one of our interns, business intern, who won. Ah, who is? I'm a major. And so she comes in a focus and I see her and I'm horrified and I go bolt up right and I stand up and say, no, we got up terribly sorry. I thought you were someone else. And I think myself, who could she possibly think that somebody else knew? And I wonder the time should I explain it to her and it seems. I'm seeing  one of those situations where it only gets worse the more you try to explain. The only thing I could do was impact a college prize and then all contact for ever. Right there. Just as one was utterly gracious she introduces herself to us with communities. But just as not only did it cringe when this happened, it cringe every single time he tells the story. People cringe when they hear the... story. And what? Seriously, what? What is it about certain stories that get this physical reaction on this? what I mean? What are the physical reactions we ever actually give a story? Is laughing, crying? Is changing? It's in the top three? This we got a radio show this American life we have looked into this matter. And I have to say if there is scientific literature, specifically on physiology, the psychology of printing, we and me. helpful doctors and researchers will enable to find it. But, when examining a wide array of printers we have made some tentative conclusions about what it is that makes a sprint. Consider please, how is it? It was six great graduation dance. There have been one teacher at his desk, but it really cool to him all year long. He was chubby and she used to examine his paper for food stains. He then she would hold up and show the entire class. She'd mark him in front of class. up to the day the graduation man. As well as wine she said okay  you're going on a school which would be good. She has started, she says well I'm not going on a school. She doesn't know what he thinks the couch past and also her drop is that really me. Yeah yeah the past of the past. I don't know. I don't know if she let her pass. It's up to you kids. You should have passed. Yes yes. Should be passed. Yes yes. I don't know. That was humiliating, but that is not the part of the story that makes him cringe. Crane's part happens when, Dresden is best Saturday night fever, tight pants, and polyester shirt. He takes matters into his own hands. He takes action. At the end of the dance, he'll leave that he is in fact graduating. He finds her in the teacher's language. So I walk here and get a smile. I'm straightaway. My jaw's both closed. You're , that might jump. And how to picture this really sweaty fabric here. We all close back. was by the Mrs. S who'd been so cruel, standing with another Mrs. S, the French teacher, at least the out to the French teacher I said. I was shouting my dad and I looked at the other Mrs. S and I said thank you so much Mrs. S. S. D. I actually wave my arm and leave my waist bound deep to my knees, , flipping my jacket with one finger over my shoulder, indistinct stran,elo keeping it crisp. I remember that out. He said, shanti, I remember their faces. And they were disgusted. thelessness smile, the wasn't , it's kind of , I'll thank you. They was basically silenced, this kind of stern, without the mouth kind of went. The thing to cheat at the helm, which is humiliated for the sales, it was the fact that he decided to thank her for it. That's a nice crunch. And this seems to be true of a lot of strange stories. People end them go out of their way to embarrass themselves. Joe's case, the back of the guy, proud wife, and the novice. If he had just come out of the men's room with his fire, they would have been embarrassing. A few more further. He made a special effort. Part of him was proud. He was the one who built Nehafus cool enough to move around with a little kid. Pride my friend. Go with the fourth grant. Now you're in your office. and then suddenly you're just , , I'm in a pretty good mood today and I'm pretty to goof around a little. I'm going to crash down by these mailboxes and I'm going to walk at the crabboats or down the hallway. , this is a stuffy play, full of stuffy people. And , and I'm still a bit of fun guy. You're changing that moment of revelation. You're suddenly seeing that maybe you are not the fun guy. When you see yourself as others see and it is not great. One of the doctors that we talked to with that, French is here, this is your show. pointed out that a cringe is basically the human body cowering and fear for an instant. And he said that one of the most fearsome stressful things that we can encounter as people is that we are nothing we think we are. That's what the world sees us differently than we see ourselves. And not in good way. Why are we coming today as always from WBEZ Chicago, distributed by Public Radio International, today I'm going to show an investigation into stories that make us cringe. at one. What we cringe about when we cringe about love, Nancy Updike explains the peculiar characters that have a cringe love affair. Up to, mash notes, and we'll check tell us story from my own past that I actually spent two decades trying to get about a week that I had back in 1979. In the set of a television show, also in that story, why I hope to never run into Alan Aldo on the street. Isaac Green comic, Mariolü Stone, Superman Massey. and me, Australia, one teenager's Prince worthy dream become Prime Minister of a nation in which he does not even reside, or, for, Pension Purge, we have a strike in Bruce J. Freeman, but a man that tries to rid himself of a decades-old Prince, if that is really possible. Stay with us. That's one. But we pinched out. It's basically shrinking from something dangerous of people, what could be more potentially dangerous in love? And see up to us this report and characters to buy laws of the truth. A cringe love story always starts with a one-eyed. I went out with a guy whose role models were Jean Jean-Maine and he came to see me. I went to one out with a South of the Collective. He just realized he was an alcoholic because he was doing so much cocaine. I once dated a guy who threw him on a satin and put a slap his foot and stopped bothering him. steps. You probably noticed these were all women. That's because Prince Love's stories are usually embarrassed and I'm generalizing here but in my experience, women  to wear some of those things. You bond up there. You  to want up in each other. You did that, beloved? Well, I did this. And while I'm generalizing, let me also say that as far as I can tell, the most common Prince Love. stories, kind of takes place in the early 20s, but a guy not that much older and you are new at all. It's not your first relationship, but everything about you are working self still feels on mode for somewhere else, movies, movies, friends. You don't quite know who you are yet, I'm just too well, because you're still becoming members. And everything these early 20s binge love stories have to just, we can learn from a woman from Texas, they're doing. I once went out with a guy who, while we were to push this. So how did he tell you this? Well, we started going to Prashada, which is the same Prashada students. Some days have to speak these times. Basically, free food is very important to eat. The reason is that June is boyfriend's squad. Do  what that is? For years, cities all over the country, school from taking over abandoned buildings, living squat, people do it for a lot of reasons. Anticorport idealism, venture, black adventures to get your job. Julie's boyfriend was a middle class kid in New York who will admit squatting from the band of rare house, Austin Texas, partnering with Chiket and keeping an eye out to the group. Julie at the time lived in the air from the start, and employee namedlichen Elixiruma. She was in her last year in college. We used to go around whenever all of her pizza and food didn't go to the hospital. She was in the hospital. She was in the hospital. And he used to say that when we do that, but I couldn't go in because I didn't want to see her. But I'm not a bitch. So, squatter guy means college, a princess, a girl. And they fall in love through the beach out of the beach. A lot of things left to it, taking this one. leaving on the edge of the eyes, they move in together to her boys while I'm tired. He takes her on midnight by night. She buys some dinner and meal restaurants. His pair of changes on the court after I said, in every week they go to the shop to get free vegetarian more free of all the Christians. And then one day he came home and he said he thought he'd  to after the shop and then he said he thought he'd  to go to the restaurant after the shop at the p ist 개� fulfilled in the college. And I said that that was for I wasn't really interested in it. So he started then he took us. That's how he started. Then he came home and he really shook. Which wasn't that it. But then he came home and he had a deer. Oh, this is not a white. She they call it duty and he told me he was going to start wearing that Always talking so fighting because he had this new belief system people can totally vegan Often so we couldn't go to a favorite restaurant because well not only was it that he was vegan But he couldn't do the place where he didn't know with the emotions of the cook work Engie that you can do to the food as well as the food that you can do to the food. Every relationship is a problem in the case of the salt. With the cringe love, it's an embarrassing problem. And looking back, it's not just the problem of the salt. It's how long the relationship between you, after this problem, not been locked in. Not only to you, but also to all your friends. that is, you aren't hiding it. And all of this was a secret being from all of that. So I was didn't tell anybody. Thanks. But when they came home and had a friend over, and John was there, and I walked in, and my whole living room smelled the incense, and he turned to my bookshelf into the shrine to Swami Papa. There was the big picture, from his candles, there was scars, and I said, you're funny, you're smart. I was , that's on your profile. Do you want me to take him down and get some sense of what I was , no, that's cool. I was just wondering who there was trying to in my living room. So then later my phone left, just had a huge, huge fight. And it started because he had his feet, he got into these feet. And pushes all these kind of rosary. but it's about only the way the mischievous two repeat this man's while it's out of care and I'm trying to change the language and she can't find it. You just repeat it 20 times, she can't do it for a hundred times. So he's decided that if I do this, then I'll be happy that always hang her and have it's not chanting for the language. So I take these bishies and I'm , I'm not going to do this. And he said, why not? Why won't you worship this? This is the moment every relationship comes down. Point for one person turns to the other and asks the question, why not? Why won't she wish it push? That's because the heart of the prince is fundamental to this group. These modifications, you're capital, you 60 minutes, you're Felicity, you're potato, you're potato, but you just can't call the whole thing off. On paper, the relationship seems so romantic. The very things that make you cringe can back. At the time we just challenges and path to love. And not just anyone, the best time in possible love. I mean there was a point where you were pulling it right at the hospital. And we were talking about moving to self-nascist and I would get a boat and be using it at the airport. We would go where you do their boats at the hospital. They would be here for me. I don't understand. She's saying it. Right. She's saying it. Right. Julie laughs when she tells us this now. She knows the story is one of the funniest things that's ever happened. She loves talking. She savers every absurd human story. And every absurd turn you've been in every sort. But when I talk to her three days after I enter her shoes. said, no, it's the weirdest thing. After we talked that night, we'll come to call. For Julie, this relationship is the first time she fell in call. John was different from anyone else she'd ever known. And she had to go out of town the first time she'd get to the other side. She thought about it. And when I got back, he sent me cards from every place in Austin. , it was my name. I remember it  a call about him. I mean, he just perceived me. And it was just, , excuse me, I'm an antican site. , we did not go out for moving in the dinner ever. I think the whole street. Not that that's not nice. And that's great. But I remember it. And wrote me this card from when he went on the hitchhiking trip. And he took a picture of me with him. And the post card said, hey, she's cake. Thanks to the cheesecake. This is what I showed around to be up. the guy is on the, he was actually a train on the mobile phone. On the train he says it's 26 in the ambulance, but no one says anything boring, actually. She's moving from the distance. She's reciting his lines from the postcard from memory. The only love letter she's tapped, she's moving. But then that's part of it. Her love for him is part of what she's thinking about. She looks back. What's the part of the story that we're just ? Remember the Doty? That's that long white sheep, June's boys. He asked you one day to iron. He's too faulty long. I ironed the whole thing. So you did iron it in the dirty. And what do you say to your son about what? I'm not going to say it. Why didn't we look nice? We're talking about what is the deal with that little doctor? But the unfold. Not wanting to be uncoor, but it makes the surprising moment. I had long talked about. and just love with few women besides one of whom once found for self-working two jobs to support a boyfriend who spent all day writing his journal about the fairies of the sonhouse. What makes you friends is not so much that you are in a relationship with your son's fitness. It's that you wanted that. It's really true. You got on the train. It was romantic. You were right in the train. And  what's happening. who isn't wrongJeasha certainly see you next phrase I want to be a judge. I want to be a judge. I want to be a judge. One point during the height of the monoprenees is different. There are quite a few things I want to do. I just have to try to put this little box  I have a real thing. It's just a sudden, , I want to do my job. I want to get to a certain age. So many things happen now. the virus to make us cringe, that it is no longer a box, it's  a whole room full of boxes, any one of which makes us cringe. And what we do is we try to keep the door to that room close, but the fact is there are so many ways to throw strings. There's so many things in my mind as things with those shame on me, six months as a matter of least one nightmare, not being casinos to be showdowns. What is this?! Well camera! Don't you think it's a hot time to continue to take an archfire? It was 20,  in 1979. It's been four days in a set of masks. I've written in this letter, National Public Radio Station. That's the thing if I could do a story about this show. I watched some film scenes or signs. To be good idea, he'd be accessory to force a fight. That's very useful, huh? Oh, you say that? You say that? Oh, yeah. Well... Well I say, well okay, well let's we'll let okay, well okay, we'll let both their heads Didn't interrupt y'all an actual term jobs and specials and documentaries now things It meant that I was pretty much skillful enough to get access to a visual station But not actually still not to know how to do a real story Recently I wasn't with the cassettes in the first time 20 years in spawn I ask them, that's a very strange question for the text. Questions that are easy to be in this way? There is the rumbling noise of somebody missing or the microphone. And then a little rumbling, preamble with the actual question. I think it's on. One of the messages and I always get from the show, is that the person has to be listened to or the person shouldn't be on. It's a very humanitarian, almost a pop-in message that every person deserves them. Is there something to tell? But this is a problem with our view because if you give everybody who knows you now by singing into these in the tension isn't it? Isn't that difficult? And can the can the be the sound of the show? The answer to that long question is yes. So the actor played Kringer and Sils. He is kind of gracious. But everybody isn't gracious. Stars, the extra status. And a certain sense that just makes it worse is one thing to be an asset. Yes. We're also  gasses. It is another here that you are the one idiot. At the time, and even I know how exactly to prepare for this kind of story and in retrospect, I have to say I probably should have watched the program a little more intense for going for one more. That's enough, for example, to correctly announce all of characters. Well, we're a character some, father Mekegi seems to have remained the most constant of the years. How are you pronouncing my name? Father? I have to hear you pronounce it through make sure you're positive. Okay, oh that's good. That's fine. This is what the don't exist. Well, now I think that the spelling bowels people because of the age of the aunt. Well, you see now until I came here and saw a script, I didn't know that and I always assumed it was Mekegi. That's better. Well I thought you were going to say it sounded kind of  a sad thing. Maybe I got a little bit of a problem. Some point in my brief time working at a VR I had been told that one way to put people at ease in an interview is talk a little bit about yourself, tell a personal story, they tell us just human nature as well. So these seven hours to take a little bit of one little story after another, that I have minutes, to talk about yourself. That might be nice. trying to relate. One thing that happens in very functional enough is, example, sometimes we'll be producing something and we had an army special and we had a genetic engineer. Just wondering if this thing is a saying is, is when I'm, I mean, I've written what the scripts for and commercials for closed schools and things  that. And there are so many times that I'm not the same, Mr. Windman is still there, I sit there and  the same thing now, just do it, , just do it with the act and then do it and I think this is off. I think of myself doing it in this sort of radio show and I feel  I'm trying to affect the public audience and I want to talk to , I want to give this a go. And apologize for that. Later, let's try thinking about these questions that they can find. Please, I... with a, with kind of century. I am but clueless and I think I know it all. Listening now, it's not the utter presumptuous of all the kids to me. If the awkward moments were I hear myself just saying anything that I can think of, it's called jokes and stories that I don't have through and it's kind of fake from all your joshing and basically anything I was trying to make a connection. I cringe more at that because that is absolutely still in me. I hear that still and I can use it. Now, for this radio show, and let's say the time, check, step it out. We'll be cringe most at the things we hate most ourselves. Also hard-fine. It's a question. So, sheer rudeness. Let's be too young. Let's try. Let's ask you some of the extras. They ever want, , speaking parts. Ask me one of the show's stories. We didn't think so. sometimes. This TV stuff really is worthwhile, a Shakespeare, asking Harry Morgan, a great character that's kind of hot on the show. We can count on this TV just to get him a media. This book seems  in most of the world as you're always there, but you're never the center. Why is it? Well, I don't know. Some people just sort of fall into that I think I'll go my life as a supporting. Third, didn't occur to you. What am I going to spend? That's it. Do fine. Not being after a leading man part. A previous, a press law. You must give the authors me. Now, you're off the leadership. At that point, keep an eye on that. That's all. Cheers. He makes a successful arm. He can't. He is a good player. Since then, a quick past Harry Morgan's face rolled up, so it's a drag net. She's up sometimes, no black. It's actually in a lot of classes. And every time I'm watching this, it appears. I mean, it's on launch. Sometimes I'll be just not able to fact exist. And if all this tape down, my most pin-tweirdy line of reference has to do with what I call them, the mess, the morals, the show. 20 year-old makes seems to have been fixated outside the TV and radio show, part E, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the people, all the time. The weirdy, whenever I bring this up on the eaks. I seem somehow to lack the language to express the start. Here's how I begin the interview with Alan Alder. He won Emmys and I'm correct. Let's go. Well, are you the reason right and what? And all the stories, very... They show up humanly, humanly, very much less than... Not... I do believe a television in the form of shit, teach. I think I'd say that question of the more of the more of the sense that you've regarded. I don't know, tell me a little bit more about what you mean. But when you are, what you try to, well maybe maybe you shouldn't find a point, what you try to tell your audience. I think that for me, when we're on the writing, we are similar, we're writing, we're similar. I can't wait for that. I'm with his... But, hmm... I wouldn't have had minutes on the tape. I asked him out a question after the question. I called him a kid ideas for me and he had books. And miraculously, he gives kind of great... ...lossied by ignoring my actual words... ...and trying to respond to a word that I seem to be used. Turns out he's not existed at all, teaching him a word  that. purpose! على this. His goal is to be interested in stories that just capture the waves who are. I understand self-registering in many times in the album. I think we make plenty of things that are interesting to everyone. But we're always strong at a panel where we're able to spread it. To reflect real experience, the audience has to reject us. For more we've been able to do that, the more the audience has made us popular. Good. They were people in the beginning who said, oh, keep them out of the artery. Nobody must have seen blood, turn off the tongue, turn off the tongue, and the heart. If we had started the couple of years later that would have been people who said, Look, you got all those nurses that showed the nurses and showed some... ...alters that showed them the number of them. So they get them to wear T-shirts. That's that. Well, we pretty much didn't do that. And then this is a stupid thing to say. But the fact is, a lot of people in the entertainment business are afraid that if you get to really, if you reflect experience to do that you'll scare people away. That they'll be bored, that it's not flat you. Just not into important thingy. The world let it be long after you've been on the Nest. day and day, after day and day. I didn't know what else is doing and there was no story. Sh bhag brush the Phaank's Pain Unged, before thrown in step, its rather different. and then do good end games. I try to end it never up. When a dream about marriage, castes life, but it's clear that I do it well. Problem with having a big future. The set, one of the most successful series, this resolution, is that the show doesn't really go well. Check TV Guide. and where I go, Chitago, Mash is on 10 times a day. So this is my grandma's very soon. And for years after I visited Settel Nash, she and I were ever together in any kind of setting  a party where we were resetting shots. She would tell everybody something, big words, how I had gone to the set. And wasn't that incredible, and everybody's around, but on sighted, so failing, it's asking us what was moving. and it was always hard to know what to do. So there will always be this one moment where some of the NCCs are something. Draw, meaning, nice, and same. Here we go. Bring up the person who makes a cringe, you can do it. Then, hang it. do cringe are non-scientific and free continues You must have a good one. You must have a good one. You must have a good one. This is American Life. Each of you can have a question to choose something you are writing to the stories on it. Today's program, stories that make us cringe and some thoughts about what it is about these stories that makes us at this goal reaction. We arrived at three of our program, at three, are we all surround, shaman, the first of the contest with IBM. And me December. Number two! óg After 3rd 1986, Wednesday. Another fascinating day of life at that time. I have a math test tomorrow. I'm going to school early to tutor a girl in their class for the aforementioned test. My math class, joint precalculus, calculus class, consists mainly of seniors not especially interested in learning. I guess that I'm the quote, class expert. And that I always do the math problems which no one else can. And for this, I'm just liked. I guess that because I apply myself, think clearly, to do a little work as well as some intelligence help. I am a dude. In truth, I am far from him. When you first read that to yourself, when you first saw it, your reaction was, it was pure hard. Recently, Adam Davidson, occasional contributor to our program, Counties Old, High School Diaries, Adam's Mom is Israeli, stats inventor's diffuse and The body was spraying at various areas. Somewhere else in the area. I remember when I was writing a very clear, although I don't say this, but that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future Prime Minister of the Eastern Minister of the Eastern Minister of the Eastern Minister. I would one day see Prime Minister be very important for history. But I don't know. With deep thoughts of young Zion. There's so much wrong with Jews and Israel that I'm going to have a job of If you see them, There'sело murderers, It was part of the health office in the farm. One thing is the lack of many strong Jewish identity, one of the most Jews. This attitude sickens you Jews of the world stop worrying about money and well being. I do not know what exactly I'll do, but if this situation continues, I'm a bit old, then watch out for a Jewelry, here comes Adam. Watch out for a Jewelry, here comes Adam, his own capital films. Wow, is that him? It's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership. I know. That's what's kind of a music. And that readership is world-during. Yeah. I mean, I have this thing January 4th, 1997. I memorized the hope of Tikvang, which is this really interesting. A few minutes. That will help me in Israel. I don't think that here I am the shiit for a minute of service, well what are the things I need? Oh God, I need to know the magic. That's right. It's your sight. That's 16. I had such an inflated sense of myself. There was so much going on in my life that I can remember. And I wasn't important. Instead, I was creating this ridiculous fence. of, , I'm not just a 16 year old kid, you have crushers, , I hope this D key, can't get a really tissue, being scared and confused, well growing, oh, I'm on the future prime minister of Israel, and everything, there's that. But I don't know, I mean, just maybe, maybe keeping a diary, won't toss the food, maybe that's a puzzle, I can't say, first situation, maybe, maybe. other people and other countries to actually make a couple of things. Yeah, thanks. I didn't have much angst about the future things. This was where I was here, Tom. It's tough to go. And I had so much angst about every other aspect. And so I now see it as just kind of maybe as a good solution. No. It was a good way to do this. But I was not able to have this space. the internet one of the greats. I wonder what the 16 year-old man gets and feel. It knowing that finally, , an audience million people is getting some of the reading from this diary. I think this would feel so small to that sister. This would feel so... This would be so unfair being on the radio being on a radio million people explain Man, I mean we're talking about this We think change Yeah, I'm pretty sure that yeah And Adam what what would this thing your out you think of you? I think you think you're super You give me this Because you're not the prime minister. Yeah, they deserve such a small walk. I remember I was very disappointed at a very sad moment. I was reading by obviously as a couple of papers, as a visitor. I would just think about how to wake up today, knowing that your actions won't affect the minds of people, how is that enough motivation? Just have your time. little craft, little small little part. , just seems to be. And I mean, they have the kind of life that basically I want from itself. What you're saying, those is that the 16 year of year would be cringey. And you're 30 year old. Right. Just as you're 30 year old version is cringey at the 16. Yeah. That's very true. Yeah. Very disgusting. Be heard this, this race repeats. It would seem  I had said that it. I thought I'd be in the church. There are a lot of stories in the life that the more you tell them, of less power, , it's  they wear themselves out  chewing them. It's not so. But strange stories somehow do not seem to lose them. every time we remember French. So what do you do? Stop, French. They have this story from Tuesday, freeman, but that's something that decides to take action. It had been a mild financial strain to take his wife and child to Europe and so for the first week, Griffith's kept reminding that they were in a special place, much better than Rockwood Beach, which ain't gone. You're drinking French work, you promised, but that's it. and the way to the sea shore he would have left him. So you want to see me, I'm sure. As for privates, he tried to fill himself with enjoyment. So look at who he was once in a fray that by room, so same time. Besides, he did not feel tired. So he was not so new. He tried to turn this into a thing. But actually he wanted to see this one, and he missed. He was looking after Dick, who was saying, he was saying, He was waiting. He wasn't so much that he was wrong. That he wanted to send him to the house. I was thinking, he's sure. It was me. You will see another wilder walk Just try and see some more visit here, let's get started. The excuse and so on for this story. The fellow he went up to as well, Maser, the same son, also a huge tear, but not so. Besides, he said that you are not too good at it. I'll be briefs, which we'll end it. See, we must go. So not. There is a bunch of things, I will given you. Well, finally saying something. I know what you're thinking. I hear you. I wish I could go. We support you. on the way back to the road with the signal next to the square it's sliding not even straight on the floor but he couldn't sleep that's what goes with us that's really getting good the scratch gets away rather not run into. I try to think it out as if it's not working out. Just being honest, I'll be so honest. The next morning, Griffith's called the Marquis first. Man in the middle of breakfast is the suddenly shoved aside, and I'm so sorry to be here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm going a little busy with my son, right? What happened to this? One time, he's going to marry me. Two. Honestly, how he did, so he walked the show, using this, shouldn't happen to the kid. So I forgot all the time, I'm not gonna tell you what to watch. I guess I've seen a bit of a service. I've tracked him down to golf sound walk. I've searched for him. Any of them. Or checking. Don't you take it wrong. There is one. Just calm. This num. Yeah. . HMM. Yes, this is one of those few knowledge studies. I've got to take just four. Six. All right, this is really neat. It's not really good. It's a neat, neat, fresh, simple, simple. I have no time to start the flow. The limit is to get 12 crooks in your room. You use the only twist. You rest through the space, point and say, But I'm not in the room. So, you finally allowed 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100. As they sign, what about you? Okay. Very simply, the habit is a good result of the second day, the office gives fresh thoughts. The task is to take a experience on it first one. One day the entire squadron settled through the office. The other side of the employee, how are you not scared of this long-term ATM last year? In the middle of the lecture, FOMG. loud and speaker waiting for the answer. Live its defeat away to take a no way world which is the closest call since there was nothing. We were back here for a while. The audience was, yes, happy with the message to the today. We'll be shadowed. We'll all be dead. We'll be sick. Sit now. We'll be sick. It's power, sir. It's fine. It's run out of your authority. What? Right. I'm going to be dead. I'll be dead. I'll be dead. for a little bit right for him. So, now this thing or bridge, however, and two days of the least, this one. That he had been just this fright that his video is secured. For him, see what he is. See how it is. Doing anything then. Making a better bridge. Yeah. Thatser. and stuck it through. Anyway, this world is not a service. Just as meeting Carol, we use 9 out for it.
