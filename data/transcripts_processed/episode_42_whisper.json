What it was ten years ago. She said that the Danyana had put herself into it. Kind of situation that 1000 comedies had built on it. Such way she commented, screw-bought comedies. Every kind of TV theater movie, drama, thing. We had done that. We had done that to ourselves. And how did we not know? Here we were. Danyana. We used to be involved. And it was the first time together as just for us. Just friends, just friends. you're in trouble when the word just goes in front of the word friend. I mean it's almost hard to think of a context where there's two words used together. Just sentence constructed. Let's listen to the word just in some radically different way. I think the verdict was just, friends may disagree. If there's a kid, if they have nothing to do with each other, maybe it's okay. But, but, but, because automatically it implies negotiations happening, just friends. Friends is  a state of being. Friends is , , there's a road, there are houses, people are friends, . So we could just, and find it's just the endowment. And as we get these school ball comedy, it's aspect. Alright, I'm going to try to keep them on-dane personal information to a minimum here, so we can focus on the bigger, universal truth, the streaming offer, briefly some facts though. And we can broken up for half a year. And she looked in New York City, I looked in Chicago, and we talked in phone several times In other words, that kind of weird post-relationship situation where there's no more sex, but you should depend on each other for all your emotional needs. So , all the work of the relationship, but none of the sheer physical pleasure, that's kind of a pleasure thing. Anyway, so two days before I came to New York City to visit Prince Sarah. Real friends, not just friends, just normal friends. And then , she-in-quams me. that there's a guy that she had started to... Alright, she's really right. And then, today's order. Have fun myself. And, , your wish in this kind of situation is you won't assentive. Okay. Be friends and be okay. When it's hard to sleep. between the signals. And we're trying to hang out and be both, , and that's how we ended up in sacks with them. The first moment of our screwball company again. So, , walking through that big cold forward, that that news slower, mannequins everywhere, and kind, and kind to, and kind, contemporary. There are actually three different capabilities and kind of interests as... to have an all the other designers and it wasn't too crowded, it wasn't too confusing, she was walking ahead of me. Just a stab at her, never quite meeting my eye. And that's why this has been for  a minute or two, is that when we're walking the street it was  that, she wasn't quite meeting my eye, she wasn't quite talking to me, she was , she's holding a certain . emotional distance. And that's the thing gets to you. We have to dig no one together, no we have no future together. It's a little bit. No. What can I ask you? And you each are the voices of two has no one. I need no parts. In this time, both parts, we'll have to be both people in the future when time or not. The person walking in the little place we had, not meeting me on, we'll be able to see. And the person walking behind, , little over eager, a little extra edge of anxiousness wanting to make a connection with a little bit right then, you will have it. the person here would be put off by the yapping of this puppy no matter how subtle and dignified and interesting. That yapping happens to be just kind of not wanting to steal this that one to face this situation walking about three places who has not, you will momma says not women. huh... давно das einfachを見する She's looking for clothes and she has this new guy she's carrying the clothes and we're looking for a dressing. We find a dressing. And we stand outside. You dress in me. And it's an automatic set-up situation. Do you  come into this dressing and  why are you trying? She's  I want to use this closet head. Do I come into the dressing? Something inherently un-eyed at all. about not coming because I mean what  what is in there that I have not seen before but there's something inherently awkward about coming in as well. this thing's changed. Either way there's a problem so it's just during the door and the door is aggressive and composed the orbit. that we're writing against each other, right? We looked at the two little orbits and decided, okay. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And she takes off her clothes and tries on these clothes. And, because she's got no other family, there's a little lazy, clean, substretched top of the ground. Go back, hang on to work with my Movies. Oh! ум,ίναι, T and she's got the small mini skirt. And while you were walking around the sex, she's been saying, , I've gotta find the arm's skirt. And you have to get a mini skirt. She just switched drugs. And she's trying on this mini skirt. And it's... it's... it's... She's looking very... she's looking at more. And I'm going to... She's looking at more. And I'm going to... She's looking at more. And I'm going to... She's looking at more. She's looking at more. . And, , it's an issue trying to research. So, is it, , , you have a minister. You have that black, , he didn't minister. I've seen you in that minister in my entire house. This is none, none, none. No. I don't, that many scurps come down here. She indicates a spot meeting an inch above the neck. I need a minister at this. That's about sure. I need to come to here. She indicates a spot meeting. I don't know. Six inches, eight inches above the neck. six inches. Alright. And just pause. And she looks at me. This is why I wouldn't wait to work. So I started thinking to myself, what am I doing here? Who do these calls for? And I can show , the guy who she's... going out where. And I picture pretty much looking at the colors, her kind of look cute in the colors, her looking very cute in the colors. I pretty much really much kind of picture and I'm sitting down on the chair, this little chair and dressing it. So, this Danielle, I'm gonna draw a bow and have a little closer to her, I'm gonna try to describe the gesture that occurs next. Imagine me, a tall-ish sort of guy, slump in this chair, sort of meaning back in this chair and this dressing. And I hope I can convey this or over the radio, the motion she does in this. I've been feeling  she wasn't seeing me, , when walking around the store, I thought she got to be, word, not seen and I'm sitting in the dressing room thinking, , I should really be distressing, I don't really need to see this right now and just to something in this thought. She takes up the miscreate and she just in the tosses it, onto the chair as if it were an empty chair. But in fact I'm sitting right here. So she just tosses the skirt, onto me. And suddenly she looks up. And in her actually I have to say, to her get it, in actual her. And she's the skirt kind of sitting on my chest because I'm slumped backwards. And so there's sort of semi horizontal surface and this skirt is now sitting on my chest. Looking on ridiculous. And suddenly she realizes exactly what she's done. And she says to me, she says to me. Oh no. You're gonna talk about some English. French. Well, of course this is my radio show. It's this American life from our glass. And by the way, I did get Danielle's permission to talk about this on the radio. It was gonna be, you're talking about it with you today. Each week on our program, of course, we choose the theme today's theme is. get over it. We bring you three stories of people who have a hard time letting go of past. Have one of our program, the equity in right now is nonfiction, actuist fiction, actuism, and all that can be true. And I bring up what happened between me and Danielle because I think that she and I stumbled upon a few things that happened universally and get over it situation. For one thing, one of the most delicate aspects of this situation is . How much information do you want? About your ex girlfriends new boyfriend? No. Or your ex whatever. My friend of Julie told me a story in morning, but when his followers. She had hunger relief to power every piece of information. Yeah. That one breaks for you. And at one point in total, the girl... ...and somehow that detail made G8-1. Me too. It made her feel , oh my God, this is a person with a right work that completely, this is a person whose life is so much better to mind. This person has a dog, which means that they have a right that can surround the dog. In fact, they have a dog means they're a person capable of blood. And it means they're a person in a stable situation with a home where they can have a dog. And suddenly everything came into question back to him and heard and the girl and I wanted to report that. I won't introduce you. And I don't know exactly why but it was this powerful, hermitive-scentening forces within me wanting information. And I found myself asking questions and I know this in very care for these questions. Listen very carefully, I'm going to ask whatever this address will indicate something about yourself. What do you ask them to introduce something? You can learn some. Listen to this. How old is It's fun. And Okay, that one makes sense. It's kind of the age difference between them and I can kind of be Christian. So it's trying to get it kind of where this is going to be. Into the geography of that old familiar landscape. That's what it's . Wow,  you have this map. I'm in emotional city that built with another person and we want to figure out what we're all doing in the map. And then I'll... So, my second question was going to be, so what's he do? What's he do? But  how every now and then you'll read an article or somebody at a party will say, , isn't it shallow? Isn't it shallow? Isn't it shallow? That when people want to know about it, if people first question they ask is, what do they do? Isn't that so shallow? Doesn't that indicate what it's shallow? , I don't want to fall in that. So, , I don't want to fall. track, but just waiting people with their jobs, , you don't want to think we are our jobs, , this is a shallow, sort of thing. So I sidestep that question. Came up with another question. The question I'm asking, don't know where this came from was. Is it you, Jew? I've been services what? One. in the last 15 years? Is he a Jew? I think what I meant by it was, , he's a member of my tribe, is he  me? Is he  me? Honey, you're seeing somebody else, is he  me? He must be  me if you're seeing him, right? The only person you could be interested in is me, so he must be  me. But he is not a Jew. Now I would  to tell you, the rubber carrier this note, that this face jealousy messed. Let's set the metal witness keys to the card, let them Ruins wrap that A New tenha Stories verse more content about this way of practicing. I would  to say that. But, , one of the rules of getting over it. If I gave you the main rule of getting it, is it you cannot choose the time you place. Now you cannot wield the tap. You cannot think, okay, now I have the right attitude right now. I'm over it. I'm ready. I'm over it and it's now. It's , , well, it's , it's , it's  in Jesus. I say this to you as a Jew. It's ... When Jesus turns, , none will know the exact day or hour. It can come out of deep in the night. I'm getting a bit. Well, coming up in just a little bit, another story of something trying to get over, trying to wheel himself, get over it. With exactly this much success, as you would expect in the app. When you're in love, the whole world is you in love. All rabbits will turn to make you happy. You seem to fly, you wings and feel so cheerful. The moon is a yarmorca, high in the sky. And each day is young, careful. Actu, wishing for a mission. But this next day, if someone unable to get over it, a couple of great sanders is amazing and sad and funny books. of a world-ending dead crime. This story is called, uploading things to fruits. Elizabeth always thought to take stream running through our conference or staffing. Whenever I said, brooding beside it after one of our flights, she'd keep down on me from the balcony. And I'd come and meet her. And I'd go, and I'd go, and I'd go, and think of it. I'd think of it, and think of it. I mean, this bear I called guilt masters. Bill masters are gene and Bob fleeing, brought us sister psychiatric records. In the late night TV, they were towels and capes and stand on either side of the sobbing and rotiforms and sweater and slacks. But the end of the bitch was rocking through a few of the daisings. I get jeeped. I tell her I've done a bad thing and I can't live there. She says I'd powder right place. She says there's nothing so shameful it can't be addressed by guilt Muslims. I'd take a deep breath and still mind God's. There's a silence for these jeeped. Then she asked, and I hold. I'll be news at home. on. Several minutes later Bob comes on and asks him to come back. No wait by the fall. One hour, two hours, all night. Nothing. The sun comes up, Brad and Comfort's grounds turns on the bubble and white water begins to flow. And I'm shallow, I don't shave, I put on the scene and dance, I've had a hundred four. It's too much. He or since he's a death, he's still on the rack. I think the flame is sitting, I think the burden on the shrimp or the setting myself. on fire downtown. Instead I go to work. Despite of my problems, personal interactive whole lot of free marching on. All morning I hope we've lost. Nobody comes in. And even I work out a little tension by running and walking one of my modules. I choose bowling with the pros.

But crappy versing no one around me in the red no wonder my rents over me. He asked isn't bowling a lovely recreation and tell him I'm in the morning. He said the hours spent in the bowling alley with friends. certainly make for some fantastic memories you've done a lot. I tell on my license cracker. He grants and says, let's bowl, let's go and involve, let's go and involve a few frames with the pros. I'm taking by the throat. Of course he dysfunctions. Of course I'm automatically defeated. I got my headset and dismal, and said no. Once again, it's just me and my thing, and shop . Once again, the air roots of my teenage popcorn. Once again, I am on my own. I'm on my own. Wonderful, I think you've got to go on 400 dollar module. And I have, so I trash it. I write it off the Greek man's and you go to lunch. I have for an out of spends freight for it. Of course I overmite the waves and the paper tile catcher and I'll put the bond in the little engine use face runs down the rover else. It's even more than edible new one. Let's shop it. Again. for another. I chuck it and go away from my regulars. A two-mister bonfire comes in with the gilking and is always repressed by a lady of comfort and puts on high heels and sorebs, fed milk free. Pred milk free is behind a dean, so he's free to get his work up as he likes which is varied. I'm trying not to hear him alone. I'm trying not to hear him college football team member by me. He's followed by the O'Kyre and Appiant sales, and he lays down a room of pretty rare specs and asked for legendary American killer stock in you. A strap on his headset, I insert his module. For 20 minutes you have him haws a Clyde barrel. Plymery who slips up and succumbs to a burst in sheened and fire, and treats himself to a sprite. Hughie says next time I'll move over to the top of his mom. He'll remind him he's getting asked in bill. He says thanks. He says his bill, and his ability to match with some great criminals, I've only outstanding things he's got. He laughed, he laughed some more. He shakes his head and moves. I curse him under my breath and close up early and he turned my long-homed home. Next day, this is Gave from Corporate Comcetown. Let me take you my significant account. and his assessment, I must miss the culturally-comfortable and unusual in the battle of his face. I let a man in here and loads his top-end cookbooks for sale.

And split the headset on thought tree room run. Newthrome's Kansas home town in 32. It's our homemade bread and dirt road to Nashville dog fetches. What a sweet drink of beer. The great-teach home town are with these ghost limbs and dunes of the chirping of the whole of acid birds. The meals allow and this is lawless, large, or sniffing spices that remind them of this mother-evil deepened flower. If you're sought to the shade of the yard and discuss these fascism with the icing on some swimming loop, it's hostage from this for the better. You last a lot. You young man. and the pressure is yet to come in arms. Keith had come back with a sense of action to cook the duck. And no one's got to figure out how to mess up. Keith obviously said that in the office and he took off his coat and came and tell him to get it. He told me that's what happened before. He said he's got a session and he knows it. The ramps he's headed in my chest is a silent action. That type of repressing surely has to deflate the abuse if you're just pretty serious about what you go about. No lie, I said that's why I didn't beat him up every time he found it. I'm not sure that's a quote which she says. We need it, so that's why I usually don't really do it.

She says she used to be a different person than she could go back to the day she was loved. She wants to back the truth and drove her game to boldly.

I'm interested in the model getting kids. and grab it, and I'll just be in chatter from the deep and deep things that are not here. But I promise to kiss or miss something, not in position of the planning and revenue source. So now of the night when the other memory is arising from the bed to comfort, screaming new ones, I usually turn it off in my half-up and everything. More of 3rd-sandestory, offered a pinch of sports, in the minute, in a pudding-potiment. To smear it in life on my request, we treat our program with music theme and invite a variety of writers, performers and deafening. to make sure that there's just a tackle that can, today's theme, get over it.

Who among us wanting to get over it is not one of them. , one thing about Indonesia, one frustrating thing, is that it seems to happen a lot more in television and movies and novels than it ever does in real life. And for an article from romantic times magazine, April of 1996, they was to have 40 different romance novels that are only. shells now, where Innesia is the potland. But does it really happen? Have you ever met in my life? For it happens too? Well, we asked to put a stock carrier in so excited. The idea was to find someone who had Innesia and asked them what it was  in real life. I was born and it might be difficult to locate such a person. They're putting in names in reality's library. But that there was at least one known and easy after reading from Tennessee and another in Pennsylvania, the particular cities and addresses could be found in essence. None says, I'm sure I'm about to have museums. This city breeds for deaf ones. There must be five or six amnesia as they may put around my office along. I accepted it, I think thinking it would be an easy assignment. began by asking everybody I saw they had or had an issue. I did this for three days and I tried not to be slept, but to ask everybody with my human contact, whether my wife and a checker with the grocery store. Do you have perhaps ever had an issue? And Furthermore, I'd ask this each and every time I saw the fish, sometimes two or three parts today. No one admitted to currently having an issue, but at least one four remember me not hard on the head and losing my head. memory for my own question.

Two people admitted to suffering from drug industry and media. One had a drinking problem. The other was myself, as did it fact that when I was 19, ate a big suicide in mushroom right off the ground in the mountains of Columbia, South America. I spent four or five hours running home at me. where I was, or why. I was hallucinating while the sky exploding, the ground bubbling up under my feet, the trees and bushes throwing off a little package of flames, brightly colored orbs. I wanted to round and round and capped after, holding my hands over my eyes, the areas. And then a man and deep picked me up, and I thought he might be my father, and I thought he knew what he was saying, but I didn't know what language he was speaking. And we went to his house and watched the soccer game on television while it's wife. who I thought might be my mother, served as coffee from a metal tray. And then I was back out on the road, and I walked up to a park, sat down to a picture of myself, and I woke up, and below the picture I wrote these words, I'm still here. This gave me an insight into what amnesia is , real amnesia. I don't remember what they are. In three days, the closest I came to find in someone with a magic was through a young woman who's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a physical therapist, a kind of her patience and added head smashed in a R-ass. Her name is Nuget, it's kind of the opposite of what we normally do. She can remember things in distant past just fine, but she doesn't seem to be able to remember what just happened or what she was just thinking, but just where she is going. So she can't freeze the describe a car. even right at bus. I asked my friend Stader if I might be able to talk with his room, and she said, well I guess so, but you might have a better conversation with his dog. He came back to my office feeling a little down, finding an immediate act was proving to be more difficult than expected. It decided to see professional health. You got a bad amount sharing walked across the hall and knock on the door at Dr. Jeff Harris. And this was a kind of work through it. I was a good law. And then the series actually comes from one APC the next. It's one of that ball-mouth seats. Getting it for a battle on second house, you might not. Not that too. Basically getting right out, you need to get your few slides. You can remove the rubber. This past is a part of work. as well. As for the theory of repression, you don't love the things that you feel guilty. So, we'll see the paint. Let me ask you this. Say, I have your ability to make your abs. Five foot this switch, you're not remembering every aim, you're not remembering who you are. What do you think? What do you say? Yeah, what do you do? What you do? But I would want to do it because then I think I would lose my youth. I would lose this. I would have a clean slate. And it would, if all of a sudden, I would be saying, remember, for your public discussion, for the way I have a way to talk. says, there's only any good food. There'd be two bottles. I think it would be smarter to be honest. This is a gift. I mean, there's two choices you realize that it's a gift. Are you looking for a gift? I don't remember. But your talking is, if , in wake up the morning, don't remember where you are, who you are, where you're going, and you're happy with it, you don't care. Great. That's still since they're attractive. It's still in their pocket. and I think this is something to be putting the situation right up with better complete rust Have you 5 days? Have you done knowing, have you? I decided to visitings of TH particular in Chicken me. She said she probably would do it. As long as I was willing to be put under her pieces. She said some people just work well. And if you're open to the possibilities that say amuse you would be okay five minutes or one minute. It might not be. Well, I'm a normal demon that I would be the bad idea. What do you really want? Do you want to get that? Let's say a few hours. Think what he did. Because he's gonna have to. what I did? I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I did a hell. I think I have a hell of a baby. Now, I'm done. I have to ask you. What do you want to forget? I mean, I can do anything from to be a suggestion with the catcher name. You can get what you live to, , what do you want to do? I'm just asking for you. I'm just asking for you. I also have been. Is it Mars? She took notes on what I wanted. Yeah, and she hypnotized me. Which involved having counter backwards from a hand-hung. I'm telling you to relax, deep and deeper. And then having me imagine being with a big garden, the streamer. Which is said if I drank from the stream, it's a different way to work. And I'll see you in my friend. Come with. So I went to drink for the street and she woke up. But it's not as old as that, but it comes from nurses all the way back. Hi there. What are you doing? Feels pretty good, doesn't it? It wasn't unless present. Well, it was fun. Yeah. I can't remember. Sorry. And what is it for now? Which town do you live in? Salt Lake. I'm sorry. What do you even do today? Hello, Ma'am. We're looking at the story. What's his name on it? Trans. Trans. I'm sorry, really. I'm trying to try. The next day I typed in music to research engine on worldwide web. We've got a phone number, the backings, the neuroscience and the university of Illinois. We called up and talked to Rob Alta, or graduate student. We told me that the kind of an issue I was looking for was indeed very rare. And that there's some disagreement over whether it even happens at all. This people do suffer long-term memory loss from severe brain injuries, but they usually these people never recovered their memories, that the brain doesn't regenerate. And they said that the other kind of thing is, where there's no physical trauma, and often a matter of the person not wanting to be met. for one psychological reason or another, and then in these cases, it's really difficult to know what a person is, basically, just thinking it. Aww, aww, how how talking to Altaugh, made me wonder if I'm nature, the kind we see on TV in the movies, where character gets hit on a hat, and a coping with his self identity, means density, rest of his story, rediscovering it, getting bonktown and hat by another copcat. but it is. really just a story that we brought to each other. But we somehow walked believing it. The next thing I did was called Diane Pracharva. I asked her if she knew anyone could be easily hypnotized and wouldn't mind having an amnesia. She said yes, she's come by the sapoo. If you came by and out for a grass, so I went back to Meta. And Doug was not only willing to be hypnotized, he told me that he'd ask Adam's 10 years ago. Why? Goes on my way from... with the North Shore of Hawaii. And that was on my way here to  to keep. And with the guy standing on the side of the road, then had a towel wrapped around his head and head, chicken blood, or I don't know what kind of blood that he pulled over. He kind of waved me over and I pulled over. He looks  a van, and a bunch of guys came out of the cave, the oldest, just a big beach. Since the so-called almost every river on the one side I've punched my long left one of the ribs. I'm sure my... I love my job, love my nose, I was out. They took me to the hospital and I didn't break any patches for it. Which one is? 21 days, which one I found you woke up? So what was the likelihood of woke up? I was scared. I've never been that scared in my life. I just knew what, how I got to where I was. or who I was. And then, as soon as I started to feel comfortable, just even a little bit comfortable, then I kind of was excited about what, I mean, I wanted to know everything. I wanted to know what, but this was, , it's just everything. This food, this, that was really wild. And he thought me ice cream, I was, whoo, why, this is good. this, remember food, you can remember hot words. What kinds of tools could you remember? I remember I taught kind of a baby talk. I think we're always a broken Makes words mindward But things were but it wouldn't come down to my mouth I It didn't take long for Diane to get in touch. He went down my top rock. The moment I'm going to say right away when I do a few real half, no memory of who you are or where you are gone. Right away. I'm running. I'm running. I'm running. I'm running. What's your name? Why? Did  when you came in there? I was asking, happy to let . So, , hi, what's your name? I don't know. What's it  not to know? What? It's  how is that blackness making you feel? You say blackness, be more. Hazard? So I can write in the Fwanda. Projections. It's fun. Watching the Gov through this, I couldn't decide what it was real amnesia, but what it was just performance that I knew, and that maybe there's no difference. God said to give him beat up and music is memory did help him turn his life around. If that's what he knew, if that's what we all knew that some level, then it's no wonder the people pretend that's more calm than it really is. Sus Pairi here listen something.
