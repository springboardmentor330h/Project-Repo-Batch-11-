  "text": "In the 1830s, the area around the Agrafoss was still massuy wilderness, rare words were just coming in, and already people were complaining about how commercialization was ruining the Agrafoss. Already there were cheesy attempts to make money off tourism. In 1827, murders into ship full of animals are in the falls. They'd advertise that it would be fulosious animals in the forest, have there as wild cats, wolves, stand, carduan could have a bottle of two boxes, a recomb, a dog, and 15 geese. In the name. everybody made money. Town of Niagara Falls clearly been settled for two decades. It's kind of exploitation of the Falls's continued premiere with two centuries since then, and what's surprising about it really is how unsuccessful it's done. Power plants fell into the river bridges collapse, deals restrict that benefited no one. If the classic story of America is the story of people who started with nothing, pulled themselves up by the bootstraps, made something on themselves. The story of Niagara Falls is the opposite story. Here's the story. something something big, it's in a huge, that didn't build anything last week on that. Modern history of mancraft can be divided roughly into three phases. The schemers who came in trying to exploit the false or tourism, how their dreams rose and fell. But that's not the story we're here to tell today. Then there are the schemers who came in trying to exploit the false or industry by the 20th century . They bought hydroelectric power plants. In factories that used that power, that cheap power moved in. But then those factories left. They're submitted by the... same economic forces that ravaged the industries and most of the rest of the states, courses so powerful they can destroy a town, even a town with one of the world's natural wonders in it. Let's not the story we're here to tell you either. We're here to tell the story of the third phase of the agresolive, the people who live in the aftermath of those dreams that have been dreamt and lost, who could present day-no-hack of the falls, the city  many cities around the country, blessed at some point in natural advantages and resources, it somehow felt some grace, felt art together. and the sound full of people trying to make sense of what's happening, living in the aftermath of what's happening. Some have made their peace with what the Hagerians, some haven't. During the next half hour, we're going to bring you two sets of stories, interlaced, half of them from documentary producer release, people went to the Falls and interviewed people living there. Half them David Kidesk, who grew up in the town of Niagara Falls. This is American Life, WVE's Chicago Public Radio International, on my request, stay with us. All the stories in these hours will be humly some day, but we'll start with this one, come with us. The opinion of Niagara above the catching positive and another on the atmosphere all over the chair. These pictures have a romantic epic feel,  the two Niagara pictures he's hung on the wall near the front door. And there are the four aerial photographs we've all spoke about the green house window. and the etchings falls in the softs, and the small delicate bloods that are lost in the future of the sink. There is in fact the picture of my aggro, on almost every wall of every room in the hall's house. I visit the hall, and we sit together on the couch and sit and under the biggest picture of the white brush in the room. His wearing his neck and feet. Walking towards the far future noticed, the crescendo building up, the change, then you can hear this question. It sounds false as you can close and close and close and close and close and finally you're there, it's  the 18th of a lower-ter when the symbols go POM! POM! POM! I get goosebumps on you. I hear that every time I hear it, I'm just good. I give you your 18th of a lower-ter, I'm sure. Well, that's the same feeling. That's what people should get when they go to an iron. Those bumps. Well, it's a school teacher, but retired early so he could study and write about an iron full time. He's written five books, folder of poems, and gives lectures to local high schools and exciting punishments. Nothing about the ball is too small for all to study. He is, for example, the only person ever to compile a copy into the history of suicide in the ball. He did this by coming through a centuries-worth newspaper set the local library, picking out all the articles and references to suicide, and collecting this information in a series of graphs, colored bar charts on poster form, which break the suicide's down by age, sex, and so on. What we do. humanf Yes, because it will pop in your day Wednesday's the least popper over the hump people will be still good over the hump we can't come in what's the do it themselves? We can come in and then what time the day suicides for clocking in It's a tough work And don't can't decide on what it is and then what month years September is the most believe in that the next month This is the next episode Paul reads me a problem Cut since anyone doesn't know I am wrong He tells me that the American falls in the area around the American The American House is supposed to be a natural wizard, spreading to 100 years in New York State law. But he said, the city of Niagara doesn't care. He says there are too many skyscrapers, too much Hong Kong, too many factories in Toy Story Factory's bus and low-end law. On the Canadian side of the wall, there's casino game, in Wasmus, in Sush. Then Paul starts asking me questions. Now the kind I'm supposed to answer, kind that answered himself. Who are we, the residents on either side of the school? wanting to think that the desire to do with as we wish. Why do we insist on introducing more and more buildings and distractions around the walls? Why must we turn the falls into a commodity? How can so many people are so unhappy today? Why are people angry when they drive? Isn't this because there are no places of networking beauty that people can escape modern life? How would it look if you stood in line at the Louvre in Paris? To see them on Malaysia as I did in 1979? How would it be if you really got to see it? There were no more people to watch before it took to get there. There are no more people to watch before it took to get there. Egypt has seulement 19% of theulk potential she spent for 22 days. What's wrong with you? Not even, I am sorry. Are you serious? Are you serious? Not even!! Is this damn it's hard to get the money right! Because I'm still laying periodion from the skim before it took now to make it pretty ugly. Cheering is tantrum but بت, not lack of energy, but no matter how hard to understand what catularity is definition of It's all around it. Flashing. By this, by that, by this. Could you really enjoy the painting? Oh. If you went to your Mozart, oh my favorite can go to Mozart. If you wanted to hear Mozart, you went to a concert. And you waited for months to hear this means. And then, right next to the stage, it was a rock band. Playing at the same time. Could you enjoy the Mozart? So when you come to see Niagara Falls, you should see something there. come to hear and I should hear.\" Paul writes letters to Naya himself in the bubble and speaks out of Catmete about Lindsay's congratulations to Erina on the ball. His opinions are in pop, Disney's an outside, and it's strange. He's been called a complainer and auntie. One city captain who took one of his friends could live to see Paul disappeared. In 1983 Paul was just finally to plan for the plot metronome in the accident. And that line, he was welcome three more than the sound he dropped his ball. All right, I pulled up in my driveway and put a large metal saw horse against my overhead garage door. And my dog was barking and I got up and I just got, I got to see the truck leading my driveway. There were two men on the back to the truck and put him driving and there were two blanking amber lights on the saw house. I put my coat on when I was signing a trip to look at it. I got up and I got here. So I called the police in the sheriff. He came to my house and he said, Mr. Gimalsiae, you've been warned. I said, by whom? He said, I don't know, but that's how they warned you. That's me. As a kid, probably this man. Your mark has. He would sit on the favorite stone, watch the letter, and fantasize about what he's . But now, Paul doesn't this man, Brad, all. He lives less than three miles from the past. Studies and writes about Paul's name. every day. Cover these walls with pictures of the box. But he can't bring me something wrong. For relaxation I can't. Just can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I feel  I'm walking on the rules. So I go with a place to talk. He didn't care. And he's at my future to feel me I don't. No, no, I can't. I don't think I would. I'll only go there when I have to. To do a favor for someone who doesn't speak. But I will remind you about what it was. Paul tells me that he's sometimes things fighting for the process of testing. You never learn and live as well. So he's plenty of time to really pursue it. And ultimately, he believes he will see that. one day when you get to have it. Imagine being that place to earn, how it used to be with the ball, people, sorry in the balls, hundreds of them with that crown shaking, with the trees bending over the gorge growing larger than most of the places in North America. All kinds of food eat, just stop your hands together and put them in the water and drink it while you're looking at the falls. I can be with it forever. Thank you for watching. There are really only two kinds of jobs at Niagara, heavy industry and tourism. I got a job in tourism. Early in the spring of 1986 I was hired by Greyhine Tourism Corporation, licensed by the state of New York in the province of Ontario. I had to pass a couple of simple tasks. The Canadian or Horseshoe Falls are 158 feet high. The American Falls are 184 feet high and have a crest line of 1,06 feet. 30,000 cubic feet of water pass over both walls every minute during the daylight hours in the summer months. The water at the base of the walls is as deep as the walls are high. I became Niagara Park's Commission to our guide number 674. All that spring, summer and fall, I drove Van Modes of tourists to all points of interest in the region. Every tour of three hour tour, who times a day, 21 times a week. Did you go on the boat? I'm often asked. Yes, I went on the boat. Three times a day, 21 times a week. Today, I know that in families follow our albums in India and Japan, there are pictures in them. There's a thing. pointing out a geologic feature. Telling a tale of dare dabbling, posed with the rest of the tour groups the natural wonder in the background providing the perfect backdrop. When I was a kid, he visited the falls often, nearly every weekend, usually just before Sunday supper at Grandma and Grandpa's. You don't ever really got over my terror of the falls. Despite the fact that I led tours at Niagara Falls three times a day, every day, for a single summer, I never thought I'd go through my terror of them. The water there is so swept, the drops of sudden. You can't stand there at the brink watching water roll over, changing yet always the same. You can't stand there without thought crossing your mind. It would be so easy, so peaceful, to just jump. And it does happen. Often, everyone who lives here has a story of someone they've seen, someone they've heard about, of someone they've not. home who was killed in the falls. Sometimes people will plan for a long time for a trip to the falls. They stand there watching the water for a while, usually they've ever been their shoes, placed there belongings there personally backs inside their shoes, climb up over the railing and jump. And see what happened. Once. Terror. A young woman. I was a table rock guy in the toilet. or there was commotion as they would be rescuers ran past us. There were people on the observation deck, calling out to the people on the made of a misboat trip. Who were taking photos of majestic cataract, waving to the people 158 feet above. People who had seen their child. And we're now trying to get the tourists aboard the boat to help the woman who was now being tossed about in this woolly waters. For body was sucked behind the curtain of water. Disappeared. I don't know if they were found. They pay people to get down to the mobile river and retreat the parties they do find. $100 a pot. $100 a pot. $100 a pot. I hit the start in the back. grandfathered. He did a lot of hunting and a lot of fish for them, then they used to hunt those calls. And he was around the river all the time. Anytime they had someone jump over the calls to sit to the side of someone, round accidently or somebody's all over the cliff, they did my grandfathered with our own, we covered the bodies, our personal ginger, to find them and to help bring them up, and then from there went my dad. No. I screwed on. After, when I was eight or nine years old, I asked, could I help my dad put his body so I just came back and watched. They needed to save all my brothers. And I got three boys that I'd order. And all my boys, who's put down with me to retrieve the body, who helps carry them up and everything. West Hill collects the dead bodies, people who go over the falls. Oh, warning, some of his descriptions may be a little graphic, you see me. That's, you see, one or two or three, he used to just  look at it. Just  look at it. that animal really because 90% of these people committed suicide and was accidentally wanted to be there so why did you say it? and it gets so happy with taking on a hundred or so then it's just  somebody repairing a car, , same thing over and over and over and I've taken 24BLE One time, I was in the afternoon that I was going to pluck my paycheck with it. Two were me. You get my paycheck, I had to wait a couple hours. My wife was with me, so I thought, drive down the May of Domestine, I was looking around the river, and she was looking there, and I got all kinds of fish and pack on both parts and everything. So, as I parked in the park, I got up and made a mistake, and I saw them tinked around the point, which was the moment we made a mistake. point or ratchet. So I'm gonna wipe this. That's what I'm doing. Someone pack yourself. So walked in behind one of the dots and I got a pick for it to log your phone. I have to pull it this way. I got that. Walked around the bay and went in behind the big rock and heard a little woman name. Grabbed up the pull up where they are and pulled up on your body, but still warm and it was just packed those nice. Apparently somebody in most of you all. went to visit his mother and father and he went in the house and there was suicide note on the table saying that one didn't want to live without the other and that being there up in her 70s for  what could die anytime. So instead of going over there, I called him and he took it together and he did. I got her body that day and I got the man's body but he explained it. I got a 18 year old girl at home. She got pregnant, her boyfriend studied marry her, and then he didn't. She accidentally caught him with another girl and she jumped over the phone. And the person pressed her on the body and I post, with the corporate body, the baby's happy. That is sick. Back in 1950, my brother Red decided he was from the Trash River in the false peril. And he paired, he needed something light that if he any rocked or a bounce out and he wouldn't get hurt. So he got these big truck inner troops and he had them all put together with nylon, having an everything and a large nettle with the whole thing. He ends her clothes for smaller energy. Any figure that he will over in this thing made of energy would be the positive thing that he came over all right. So I told my partner, Helpy, and he said, why? I said, mainly because you weigh more than the barrel you're growing over him. I said, those energy, when you grow over the falls, it would hit the water and stop dead. And I said, you're going to shoot great through it, right off? So I said... I'll be alright. I've seen him that morning, as I started my house, I've written my mother. And I went down the maintenance land with my brothers and my mother. I felt they were thicker, too much smoke, I read them. And I was standing on the dock and made the list when I seen this some twitch smoke. I've written my mother's neck cap. Bill's dead. She's called the noise and the twitch rosemary stuff. And the smoke was made by smoke. and we have a body in it. My mother had been fighting. My father and his boys here. So we were going to take a body on the rescue somebody and we were going to take a body on the rescue. to stay home. She just, she'd worry about us all over. She always, when my brother said he's going to call, he'll never said one to try to stop. She said he talked to my family. She said, I can't talk. She cried. We're all bullheaded. She said eight to both. She treated me. My other brother in Norman, he worked in the business for years and was just very bad. under the project he went to work in Hyder해. And he crazy down, around when he got him to have a good company. campe There's a legend probably telling my tour guides. I would be telling this legend at the base of the Pride of El Walls during the Cape of the Mine's Trip part of my tour. This is legend. Every year, the Indian surrogate balls were in the autumn shoes of May to be sacrificed at Niagara to appease the Invigod in the New Orleans Hall. To ensure safe passage. called dark winter months. Now it happened one year, the fine chiefs and the lovely daughter was selected as the native sacrifice. The chiefs loved to start a very much and though it broke his heart he went through with preparations. In April they arrived the canoe beautifully painted and laid in with garments of flowers and cornered copies of native bounty was carried through the village with his lovely muita and the side. In the setting of the river and she drifted away. design. No, can you do our destiny. When she hit the first rap as above her falls, she met up a small cry of terror and her father, overcome by heart, wrenching grief, jumped into his own canoe in hopes of rescuing her. This her canoe tossed and turned in the rapids she called out again and again. She paddled faster, but a lacy was to late. In the final cry she passed over and was lost. Her father had not been speaking to the end. and hate him disappeared. It is said that the market here at Paul's is the father crying out an anger, and Mr. feel raining down our tortures. I would retell this legend three times a day, every day, to us throughout your injurement tourists, to visitors from Tokyo and Bombay, to smiling blonde hair, straight to families from Nebraska. It would smile and nod. Smile and nod. And then simply because I got to not help myself, I would tell them that the whole thing was a fabrication. That's what we're all. The visitors, what if Missouri and Melder would lower their cameras, squinting at me? Just  John. I think we're welcome from a dream. I tell them that the Aboriginal people who lived here never ever engaged in human sacrifice of any time. But really, it was the way amazing about this story. It was an issue by for so long. In the time of the very group. the earliest of the gods in the area. From the 1820s when the miracle was only just turning up. When I didn't tell them, was that I wouldn't have cared at the end of the mist grade every summer. The right-down means street-time falls in the end of the night every year. After the shiner's, the nights of Columbus, high school bands, waving big netaries. The most elaborate float would appear. A recreation of the maid of the mist legend, usually with a babyener or an outdoor dressed woman who made the young woman from the reservation nearby. There she'd be in her chicken wire and a great paper canoe. Boy is on a very break to prepare for the Shade Catarat, smiling, waving, throw wooden nails. I met a man in the bag. told me a story about this being an Iron Balls, which is a story I think I've never ever been trying to explain to myself. He told me that the mayor of the city gets to it. A 30,000 dollar sale and a license paper is called. The license plate reads NF and COO. Nayak, the balls, number one. A couple of years ago there was a mayor in Nayak who got voted out of law, but was so mad about being asked that he refused to give the license to the minute. They argued back before he came back in the park. New Mayor. system you'll hear. It's a field mirror, fused. Final is the man who bought the new mayor to the plant. He hired some men to steal the plates and the car of the old man. This I should say is unlike the new mayor was a policeman and he absolutely did not. With the man in the box that he and many of his friends didn't go to the police. He said this is the time to tell. It's the time to tell. with a new name, just list of the old people's products. Dawn Glenn is a newspaperman who's worked at the Niagara Pacific at the 3rd and 7 years, not in Britain's times of fall. He takes me on a tour in the same year. We drive through downtown Niagara. There's not much driving to do. It's mostly a great event to you all. So we circle the same streets of her now. past the convention center, past the old man after the teller, past the old guard and moving from home, past the convention center, past the old man after the teller. See this big building here, the flash kill because, let's see, how's it now, chemical, etc? There's very little, I keep to see in there anymore, because, well, how's it now, let's move down to the spot. The largest tent in that nice story building. This says something about the city of Niagara Falls. The largest tenant is the small business disaster assistance office. All these places in both sides of the street through two or three miles. They're just, , bars. A lot of bars, chapter 11. I have to thought it would be neat to open a bar and just call it chapter 11. Televy packed, solid people are chanted and done. Now I ever was an industrial boom song in the 20th or the early 15th, but in the late 50s and 60s, the electrochemical companies were slimy, found cheap power, non-union labor, and lower taxes in other states. They left, and people left with them. Then in the late 60s and early 70s, things got so bad that now I've got left a flamboyant man with a flamboyant. The mayor was E-Dent Black, and the plan was urban new. It was a simple plan which had three partners. Part one, the city would buy up all the properties on the 82 acres of land which constitute the man who was down to the area. Part two, the city would tear down all the property on the 82 acres of land which had bought. And part three, developers from across America would flock to buy empty lots, and they would build the new city. This plan is part of the reason it doesn't take very long to go on a driving track and werelaughing at all. They only need to collect one and two. Everything is just kind of  level. And they thought that all these developers can then rebuild. That didn't happen because the developers weren't standing in line this mayor thought they would be. And just wanted to come here. They didn't want to invest in the industry. Just didn't want to. I thought he had a lot to do with the mayor- leader. He didn't want to. For whom the plaza is made by the way. And it's the only chair to turn on city, meaning pleasant for him. Down turns a corner and drives its past the Lafay Plaza. A large concrete square, a shallow white wall around it, in front of the Anderson's Convention Center. He points to the corner of the wall, where there's a smooth browns plate. See that marker there on the end there, it's missing. See that little plate there? It looks  this is a empty space. Somebody stole the plaque. That's the Lafay Plaza, and that was the only proof that was the Lafay Plaza, and someone stole it. And gone,  what I mean? The Lafay Plaza does years. Lafay Plaza. I had to tell you something about the city. Isn't empathetic? I mean, somebody thought that's wrong. We wanted to get rid of the black. To dance. That's what something. We drive up the streetaways. Past two enormous parking complexes, a couple of blocks involved. They are pristine structures, forestry thrashings, which take up two entire city blocks, and do everything around. We can see ramparages. They've never really been filled. Have a good news. And they're free. You notice that? Yeah, because it was foolish to try to charge somebody. Finally, they put it on the screen, just one here. But that's only because they're trying to take advantage of people working in the office, but the one closest to the fall is the screen. You can walk in their own, all over it, all in levels of free, just because they're thinking, yet all the boats are in place there on the electronic system. They've spent a lot of money just setting up the back of the business. And that's it. You gotta remember that this is probably the capital of pipe trees. I don't know why that is, but you could go over to Nadia Island, which is close by in its own five miles away. That was one of the sites suggested once for the home and the United Nations. I mean, that's big thinking, big planning, right? Of course, never happened because of Rockefeller's money. They actually thought you can get the United Nations here. More than half of Niagara's population is left since the 15th. With industry gone, Don tells me about two thirds of the population's Niagara Falls has done some form of public aid. And almost 60% of its population is out of it. Young people do not stay in the world. So you're gonna have it on sale in 20 years. You're gonna have it on sale. I'm sitting for 80. Yeah. This isn't going to be  a huge child smell. You're sitting in your sitting system. So,  a question? Yeah, I think that's right. There's no young people just don't know anything. I don't say anything. And I mean, I mean, , in the 20 years now, you're going to be a bigist. Well, it has all the making to that come. Coming up, two weddings in a funeral, plus tape recordings made by someone inside a barrel as he went over the falls. Guess which Banjo Pissong who was listening to is he went over the ring? That's in a minute. From Public Radio International, we're not moving. This is American Life, my class. Here we have the program for those today. I'll be on our 12th class. If you have a program for your job or your teamwork, I want you to ask me your question. I'm your grade student in Korea and I'm going to try to open the next department this year. I'm about to put my exams on the line and I'm enabling me to try to reach out to my coach all the time and I'm getting work as a student. For it's a place that doesn't need to work to do enough work for you to try and study. program in the Hagra, the story from documentary producer of the Sveagle-Decided Falls, and from David Kideski, who grew up now. The one sense the story of the Hagra Falls is the story of how we as Americans relate to nature. We were very romanticized on one hand when we tried to exploit them in the other. There's no accident in one of our countries, most famous ecological disasters, love canal, where so many toxic chemicals were dumped, the residents had to be a vacuuming. This is a few minutes drive from the falls. There's chemicals there because so many factories grew up in the falls. hydroelectric power provided by the ball. Next, we're street. Chief Plentiful Hydroelectric Power lure the electrochemical industry is of the world to Niagara. My father worked four years or so for the Department of the Sociality and Facility there. My uncle Ray worked for Carber on them. My cousin Ball for Union Carby. My cousin Carl for good year, Tyre and Robert. My uncle Matt for Oxidental Chemical and Control and Blumley notice for Chemical. The factories line the Niagara. not far from the falls themselves. When I was driving tours that summer we were instructed to direct the attention of our guests toward the river. It's going out the widest of the river. It's going out the relative calmness of the water. We were instructed to keep the attention toward the river, and away from the chemical factories belching yellow and white smoke. None of this would appear in the official tour guide training manuals of course. But the veteran guides who trained us reminded us that we were working for Chips. And... who would tip into a guy who pointed out a ravaged and wounded blinds game. Someone who's attention had drifted to the east might ask, what are those factories? We were then instructed to explain how during the war effort these planets supplied the armed services to aid in beating the axes powers. And those nine-logged GIs were applied Euro-QVs with were made right here in Niagara Falls. The summer I turned 17 and was a great deal with family talk. about which plant I should work for, just with some, see if I might need the money's good. The money is very good. But I did not want to work in any one of the factories under any circumstances. They seemed deadly. I knew that my grandfather retired early because of the saving health. He died of pink radiocancer in 1966. My grandfather was a chemical operator. He ran with the costbeard chlorine. Connect ring flippers. management, detergents, sop to, they use a Defear Fund water. My relatives say dioxin is the air there. They say that when they made cost, they would go up and turn into cost of dust. They say it was everywhere. Even the place where they ate. They say you can write your name in the dust on a table, do you leave your coffee cup on a table and they're getting marked? I spent a lot of time sitting on the foot porch of my parents' house staring at the back, denote numbers. horizon, towers, ironworks, smoke stands. You can also see the mist of the falls from there, but you couldn't be sure if it was the mist you were seeing or the smoke from the factories. Here are my parents' house kids with plenty of the sights of the bare-knocked factories and dumpsides. They called them the lights because everything there was thick with white ash. It's hard to say that they stayed in people. If you look at the studies, Niagara's cancer rate is higher than not the rareous. Just a little. Even in and out. the hospital for months. One night when Tom was home from the hospital, we were all watching him move the untill a vision. Karen Black and trilogy of terror. The one where she gets chased around her apartment by the Muzini fetish doll. And Tom had to go to the bathroom, and he helped him down the hall and then to the bathroom, and he had a seizure. He went, and passed up in the bathroom floor and his eyes rolled back and he was head. He all started to cry. That's some of our Thomas given rate. aviation therapy, cobalt treatments. We had to wash him. We had to take care of him. Sharon was taking care of him what he had to do when he was playing with some toy soldiers in the yard. Sharon believes that Tom knew that he was dying. He was killing the already fall in the soldiers, shooting them over and over. And Sharon said, why are you killing him  that? Well, he said, what we want supper  that. Death and love, that's what Niagara represents, the next is Death and Love. Suicide's on the one hand, honey moves on the other. When I told a friend I was going to Niagara Falls, he asked me if I was getting married. Four different people asked me that question. I told them I had no immediate. plans then I called 1-800-785LOVE, the Niagara Wedding Chapel at the Radism Hotel in the Niagara Falls, New York. The Niagara Wedding Chapel offers what they call a pool service wedding, which means that in addition to a ceremony with flowers, creature, complementary bottle of champagne, license, and wedding video. I'm entitled to a day of beauty at the Harris Law next door, in a discount on a room from my wedding night at the Radis. Niagara I was told is the honeymoon capital of the world. The Niagara wedding chapel performs over 2,000 weddings in. At the end of our conversation, the man on the phone who identified himself as the owner's brother suggested that he and I get married. He told me he was single and I had a nice boy. I actually have this proposal in my notes of our conversation. There it is, read under the information that the 24-hour waiting period I wrote, Blue Ball Point pen. Well, Mary, me. It's Kathmandan ages first time, which is a little unusual for the Nayahra wedding chapel, most of their markets are set for marriage. Kathmandan and AJ have driven to Nayahra from Pittsburgh in 30 of their friends and family, and are now waiting together with their maid of honor in the welcome area outside the chapel. They all look happy and nervous, they're laughing and joking, talking about the kinds of things you talk. before you get married. AJ, you still have time to back out. No! You're the only one who's been called. That's cool. I should have called it a bathroom. Chris, the owner and manager of the Niagara Chapel, comes in to tell Catherine and AJ that even though two of their guests have arrived, the wedding must start. He's got a fourth or third. He can't wait anymore. Everyone hurries to their places, while Chris makes a brief announcement to their guests . They're allowed to take pictures, but everyone's— must remain in their seats until the end of the ceremony. I barely have time to wonder why this last instruction is necessary for her. I barely have time to wonder why this last instruction is necessary for her. Katherine starts crying as soon as she enters the chapel. She cries away at the altar, cries as she takes her place besides AJ. cries as it just just reads to the opening of the ceremony. cries more when the justice asks her, and her lover has been through significantly. health. The Baroness of her emotion impacts everyone in room. I see three people in front of the bunch of their shoulders and bring their hands to the face. Then the man in the second room next to the wall. Then the woman sitting next to him. It jumps the tall girl boy sitting next to her and moves to the third row. Then the fourth. Now I am crying. We are all in the room, crying. Everyone happy and blessed and sure that everything everywhere is going to be okay after all. And then six minutes and 47 seconds off, it begins. It's finished. AJ and Captain are now hosting you all. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very tired of hearing the things that they're going up. In another ten minutes they're gone. All evidence, a couple is removed and the only sound in the chat box is the home for S&Line. Chris pops in a new video from the next couple and resets the video machine. He sets out a new bookhead and checks to see if the bride's dressings. Then his 430 year off, Rod and Lor, just the two of them, no friends, no family. Lor goes to the bride's dressing room to check her makeup and I try to talk to Rob. This is not an easy thing to do. Stay play, Dick? , you jersey. I will be on my food jersey. Right. What, what, what, what right you? Well, Roy, right. She's been to the mall. Right. Had you, you heard about it? Yeah, thank you, no, no. He's very quiet. Yeah. Roy comes out and she and rather introduced the minister. There are handshake. and someone comfortable after. Then, no one cries this morning. The two of them walk alone to the altar, chaplows empty, just rose and rose and cherries. Rod and Lori stand stiff as the preacher of each on and on. Rod seems perpetually awkward, not physically happy at all. Lori isn't physically happy either. As I said, there's no one in them. just a bunch of chairs and some video channels. And it's hard not to wonder why they chose them to engage in the sets of size of all. It just seems so sad. I look around the little stage that serves as a wedding altar. We're all day long, it's a series of these kinds of 30 minute calls. One couple after another, some happy somehow. Then, eight minutes after the weekend, it's over. Rod and Moia has been in one. No one's in the car. Naya Agra, home of the two 10-kani moon, one 10-kup, one 10-back, that's a Christmas me. He hands me a card which says Naya Agra, Honeymoon capital of the world. But Naya Agra isn't the honeymoon capital of the world. It hasn't been for a long, long time. It held this title between the 1840s and the 1940s. When the railroads made Naya Agra a cheap and easy weekend getaway, for newlyweds in the West when Shimizu was disconnected fromcych-ed fromok disc later. to being at Ohio, New Jersey, all up and down the East Coast. But the railroad was discontinued decades ago, and affordable air travel makes destinations Hawaii much more popular within the West today. But the idea of Niagara as honeymoon tap on me in a hundred old movies and song, and those movies and songs are powerful for us. Chris tells me he gets calls from Florence at London, England, from Japan. The office in the back of the chapel. There's an entire wall of pictures and happy couples and been married by the parents. I look at the pictures. Chris gets ready for the fight tomorrow. Here's another story we would tell us to work out. This one happens to be... true. Annie Edson Taylor was a 73-year-old school teacher from Vasity, Michigan. She arrived in Niagara sometime in the summer of 1903. She was along, some say an old maid. She was penniedless. She was desperate. She made a reminder that she would in first person to go over Niagara Falls in her barrel. And she designed and had built a special barrel. She hired manager, one-prank emhase drawings, Russell. out to the world of the 73-year-old Taylor was a little, 42. Taylor, not the press saying, I might as well be dead as regaining my present condition. It will be famed in fortune or instant death. At half past one, on October 24, 1903, Annie at some Taylor squeeze into her barrel. Cold water inside the barrel sloshed around the rankals. Annie could feel the cold the smithiness of the rap. her bear all banged and scraped against the rocks above the halls, Annie, deafened by the roar of the river prayed aloud. The bear all near the crest of the mighty horseshoe and hung there at the lip, seemingly stuck, hanging open the boiling chasm, the crowd gasped, held and spripped, and then she dropped into the cataclysm, into the chasm, into the boiling chasm below. She was pulled out of the bear all below the falls, days, leaving. very much alive. A cheer when up from New assembled crowd. The woman is alive. While Annie recuperated in a Canadian hotel, Frank and Tussie Russell disappeared with Annie's barrel. He made a fortune with it and beautiful young woman closing his anny, cleaning the balls. Annie had another barrel built, posed for photos with it, told and retold her story to her as the super pannings. She went her autobiography. aged on the streets of Niagara, told tourists she was a widow, 52. She became scary, died alone, a lady of good breeding and refinement. This is the story of my hometown. The prevailing symbol of the town used to be the beautiful Indian made of the nest, when really, an auto-opened bath locked down at the heels, an eons and tailor, a lady of good breeding and refinement. You never got an even break. You have to become one. I remember when the guy was working on my barrel, I used to stand back, stand aside, and just sit into it. I used to do a lot of work on it myself. And that's the only thing you can look at that. You become one. You actually acquired. quite a relationship with a male, a piece of metal, that one will not understand unless they were there, that they were there, that is saving their life. So you can mention that the psyche and the unity that we have with this festival. Peter Deepen-Radi lives half a mile from the falls, so close that is when does sometimes rattle from the road. One night in 1987, Peter was lying in bed listening to the falls and hit him. He would make history by going over the falls in the barrel, go to men. The first time ever two people would go over together. He found a partner, a guy named Jeff, and together with a crew of men they built a 3,000 pound-blocks deal barrel, and the inner tubes inside the cushion they're fall. Two windows of bulletproof glass so they could see at as they went over, and a stereo system so they could listen to tunes. They also installed a recording system so they could document the whole experience on tape. It took them 19 months. to build and then let's Peter will tell you. There was the mention of that bridge. As part of the second end, I used to sit out here in front parts of the three in the morning, because it's just me and the boss. It is wrongly, I would say the only half in the morning way, and so quiet. Now sometimes if the wind is right, the breeze is right, it carries the mist all over the down the porch. You can see it's called the wall and the backdoor be where Darling goes down the porch. sitting there and all of a sudden all of a sudden you reach this little finger of missed that left the mainstream of the missed came over and it hovered over the small per capita car and it looked  two little fingers and it's pointing to the middle pointing right at me sitting there it's day there for about 10 minutes Then finally,  a finger as if you're just bending your finger back to the palm of your hand. It's drawing the rest of the mist and that's it. And it's just, , how about getting in deep it? It's  it is kind of suddenly messages and, oh, that's what I went through and we are this. I came home and I called myself, , doing a normal job during the day and I came home. I went to bed, I was late, I was going to have a nice morning, I didn't go, I didn't get back. I did have a summer sleep repair that means psychologically repair is not that good in body. I was going to get back to bed, I was going to get back to bed, I was going to get back to bed. But next morning I got off the Jefferson down. So we got everything together, the whole crew together. We, the vessel was up at the Kuchu House, all the David State truck. There was a special crew system on the truck and I don't reply into it. Now we'll never forget the sun. And for this day, that sound in the late Monday night. Then we'll probably... There's metal dog links. It is  being sealed into a metal coffin. And that was , yeah, this could be it. This is your coffin. So here we are, we're going down the road. We can hear our acting. here. That was the shortest two miles trip ever in my life. We could hear each year's ship, each stop, each turn, and there we got to really, really turn on. And we went down Murray Hill along River Road.
