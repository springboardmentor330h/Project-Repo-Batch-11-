It's not , well, it's real. Then board cast the mission. First. This ought to be the minimum of this rule rather than the same state of the world. And the children do not know what's next. From 6 to 0, saw horrors of the area sector, high school, poor classroom, may find test the weakness, math, and other key subjects. Great little saw this working 27% I hope. What's the price? Nothing doesn't give you huge sweetness. I can't really stress the price of that. I'm trying to make it a little bit easier. I can't even say that. I can't even say that. Later, there's a discussion with the Russian background. I'm asking for the charge of the English. Just asking for the English. Just asking for the English. You can't even hear this program. You can really just imagine it's an English. This is banned from having to focus on the fact that it's a new ship. finding making good, was  discovering ready, is not being successful. I think it's hard. I think it's hard. By the way, I have this... ...is how me or... ...jaded to that old... ...self. F***! Oh, I don't think so. I had to say, well, that's all right. I'll ask God to serve him this year, Adam. It's the sound. Okay, Steve, nice and warm. Well, back to the house. Jack hit this incident radio from his home in Newton, Connecticut. Coming up in the second half of our program, we moved from the radio we evolved to the radio that actually exists in most radio stations. Plus, no bell-piece prize winner who wants to host a radio show  Howard Sterns, and no Chernobyl piece with City of Pizzot, and that's the main dollar from your attention. Yes, or I will follow the bally armor. Answers, real answers in a minute. Thank you for your attention. recording of V 103, VVAZ, which is a part of the year's back V 103 was in first place. The radio is now in here. Hmm. Decides. And by applying scientific principles, the salt and Tony Gray in public directing Max Myrtle, transformed V-movey to the title number one in the study here after year, the delta H25 to the fifth. This of course means hard to write a new much bigger profits. Voice is many adults, listen to them, so such as the study's public retention. Let's go ahead, Max. made a station number one. This story of how radio works, in much every commercial station on the bank. This is the science one. And it begins here, it's in a black way from the existence of the earth. These are the offices of company that v1 from higher and such strategic media research. Every day young and many tend to discuss information, data, the other systems. It's targeted. The V1 or 3, the angle of the listeners, the V1 or the 3 wants to be the others. These are 35 to 44 year-old African American women. They're different women and women from that, for very simple things. We're more than actually going to fill up a lot of time during this series. In most cases, the stations are quite a few. you can rely on women to fly out to So they get this woman on the phone and they come up with a phone which plays in brief cops 30 different songs in the phone. It's about 15 minutes. Free song, little press numbers in the phone's to have 10 to Cape for familiar with the song, how much they'd  the song. And if they can board the song, which makes us the most important thing. Well, as you get it, record on the air, you have to note when you take off. There's nothing more important than that. I think that a job person away from the station is gonna sound great. It's just time. Every week, I think that a girl in school is rising, that's just, and he must have, that he sounds the same as his name. A sounds we played in the Pima of the 3 and half hours. These sounds played for five hours. That's just it. These 30 songs, the name of songs, the name of songs. They make a 40% of the music. The other 60% is with radio programs called, Provings, it's always test well with broadens. We want to hear that means Marvin Gays, Section 10, and we can find a new date. One last week's last night's cross-dark six songs just to not test well enough to stay on the stage. One of them is semi-metal favorite from Max, by Steve Carter's. Steve. There's not one of me the name on the radio, so I just said it's a cross-dark five-blocks. I'm married, it's a classic. The reason the song is in work is because we can play several things. So, we say, we should say, then you  this? I love this song. I love the host. But you cannot read this place. It's not about me, it's about listen. It's about playing with the same song. You have your own radius, whatever you want. It's my job, you have that same, so the most important thing. I have my own radius, listen. And I play all this stuff, I want to play as often as I want to play. And I want to take this. When I come here, it's about business, big business, millions of dollars. There's a fear of affecting the children's rights. They're real close. Even if three has spoken patterns, we're going after the same demographic scale. The average person's assessment, since we want to do it for three months, it's all... ...some of us, some of us love it, and it's higher. Some programs that they've done it. is to take back the mistakes by the root of the root. So the decisions from the question after where it is used to them in the draft. You want a few questions? Sample is not a method. For the reasons that Sample and bits of old songs are popular now, but not the purpose. That's the reason for making the videos from songs. Science content. Picture. You are a song. This is a famous song. This is radio stations. This is telphets. This is... especially all those, but they can see that they recognize the life of the song, the musician for Adrys and Vedas. One of the songs in the next album is the song called Two Codes. This is not a song we were looking at, but the song is the song that we were looking at. This is the song that we were looking at, but it's also bad for the song. It's from the new song with this song. Well, here's,  the song, what is the song? In the end, we didn't. Nice and familiar, so long. It's such a sadness, which is, in marketing, for our 200,000 days, we've been fooled. We've been fooled, we've been fooled. The main thing is, it's the single most important day. We've been fooled, we've been fooled, first of all, so we can get this. Let me know. And then test that. I highly agree if this and what the... Then my experience of being short playlists always seems to be a fixed model, flux, purpose. When I went to visit the one of three, I was not doing my greatest reviews. And I'm curious about what this is , what's not going to happen. That let's – that ... let's collaborations. Celebrate with figists of Saint-Poms. And the scariest thing is that the next thing is the stress of the fun. Tony and Maxim are the same. We have a certain radio as teenagers. Ask them what they got about. And they talked about finding humans in the morning watching the kids. Talk about the satisfaction watching the science getting hard actually grow. And they were so organized by the morning and studying. of the same songs that we've seen. By D1 and from your 10th and 5th, we're just there. As , the public radio does not stand above all this. Research is exactly the difference. Jazz played in Chicago, jazz played in Chicago. Classically, the most interesting thing is that most any of us can help us, it's very, it's a pop-it's thing to do. One of the interesting things that we wanted to do is that the format doesn't pop-it's the same thing to do. The series. I hope you enjoyed this video if you appreciate it. And yells  that, then it's impossible to answer it, no mashing lull\". Not enough beinguming. and he leaves a good designer and he wants to be with him similar, he wants to be with him. And his life is growing, as well, but I don't want him to have his illness. So now, in fact, it's time to have a vision back on after the Business is a- Affair good job! Business... � МУЗЫКА have , chill business,  how they're done here? They were all slaves, one thing. So the kind of a problem, we wouldn't have this rich roots, I was sorry, they were slavery. I never said slavery was good thing. I said it was a, it was an ideal thing. So, because of them, they've been trying, they've been trying, they've been in that sense, because of what you say, it's per se. So, if slavery is trying to be a problem, no, I want that, no, it was important to me. I imagine they did those logical problems. One more thing that the science of girls making made really different kind of challenges got this important. There's a small deal about it isn't this lusty. It doesn't mean its finished it's인이 hourly yaz Gosh, that is my facebook And let me just say one thing, I'm not a business with any people and I am just who I'm sorry but anybody was a better guy than Mark's. for you three March 2020. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the feedback. All right. I'm glad you got it. I'm glad you got it. I'm glad you got it. I'm glad you got it. Well, first of the science of it, the machine of modern life takes as well. Thanks for that. A lot of people in ideas get knocked off of the air as programs for things to think about, predictably, in scientific effects. Bye. I had a job as a DJ and he did a new job as a school student. He was a good school student. I was the voice of C-Rack, and what they'd have me do was, I was kind of younger out of the guy to do it now, but they, , that was the only female voice on the stage. So I had to be really angry, which isn't the way that I am personally. I got 14 E-C-Block, , who was, and I could have heard somebody. So... So it sometimes And were those instructions to you? they actually sit to their  no no Make it sound angry No actually I did all the production I just did everything I just was funny and I think I got paid  $5 And then at the end of the day There was a boss that we hear everything Which is sound more I know how to  a Dominatrix And something Right, well, well what happened was they started out this but rough station and so you just got three or four points. What do you want? But rock. But rock. And I mean that most during we had really loved these things. It's an easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. So I'm just gonna describe the common but rock. And the, , weight, weight first dreams. It's just very slight framerate with this. This guy is a program director. He knew that the best thing he did was to let me go and even on the very first shift that I did for Saturday nights he'd let me play some of my own projects. Which was an amazing atmosphere. I noticed the sound very much, but it was enough space to be a human and to have a lot of fun. Seriously. So what happened? So, so I have to put something on. And I saw, I think, since the next six days would look  I could do more of the work in Bangalore, The data set they wanted to have a station that means nails used to be five to four silly things before that. Here up, we found it to Placicrad. This is the speaking trick. We're up, this is Placicrad. So, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move. Placicrad. Up, up, again! I was literally afraid to get fired. And I'm putting this on the writing of why. I want this expression to be so stupid. But the teacher is just okay. I don't know how I work here in Mario. No. So that's the same thing. That's the same thing. I'm just gonna love it. That's the exact thing. How do you teach me this? You teach me this. You want it the first way of teaching. This is the law. This is the side of your family. So, those ones. And then I just think that if we're going to happen to me, then they want me to become somebody who said what they wanted me to say. , ,  those, they're problem liners. First of all, you need to be very good to you. They see a sibling. Keep your butt set on us. What are you doing? that was a name? Yeah, that's called a liner version. , , 20 cents per row. You're my bad. , stuff  that? Yeah. So, simply really nail a throat. No. You need to keep your fingers. You work. We're actually, , , 18 years before, say we're the most vital in five of the DJs. And they just been, they were just absolutely neat. , if we could just have to say... So I read that book, I mean, keep your butt locked on us. Everyday is no day. We play to the songs for someone who's 20,000 dollars. And either in Liverpool or Liverpool, or the list of songs. Yes, they listen to the list. This is exactly what songs are. And I'll see them. What's the pressure? I think they're different. They're different. They're different. They're different. I don't know why people become DJs, but I don't think that they look different. They're really big followers. Really biolaryd, saying why? They look at it  a... , bro. You look at the video station. You look kind of... Yeah. Yeah, I thought it was really big followers. And it was magic. Magic with help is just a little bit of vital. Rube. And I really really  the list of the head, I just, on my phone to the left of the full show and I just basically taught people. And I taught about what we're doing, you work, I taught about what they were eating in March, . People, people would send pictures for what they did. And it was, it was the salt, it was the community, , and if it was hot, we were working on groups, , and it happened to pull up and talk about how hot they were, who's the hottest. And then I cut it. And I shouted out songs, it sounds really hopeier. stupid or whatever but you're just making somebody stay and I can't say how much I love that and that's what I think brings my heart to this side is that I think I mean it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing I just so don't want to sound  a better person there aren't very many of anybody that understands what I've gone which is , saying it's just  an open it's weird really So heart-breaking, ,  this is something that I love so much and I just don't think that it exists It's  being loving somebody that you never met Or , or , it's  sometimes strange situations where I just love this thing And I don't, , I don't see it So we're eating, right now Now Oh, well, actually I've been doing a lot of things. I've been getting a meal and writing a lot. But , we'll be out in one second. We have a lot of things to tell them , answering problems that I've raised for a while. And, , and the reasons is that they do it. Oh, , I actually, I actually, and I've been doing it in a station. There's a station that I'm going to  to tell green. So, thank you. You can play with these people to see real, now. You can see it. You can see it. You have to search and even have to wait for these people to help me. I actually went all over every single thing that they put on yoke and it was to every situation that existed. And to be fair on one thing. You feel  a problem. It's nothing in the metropolitan. I say it right now. Actually on the actual video, you literally had to put up. Pull on the station and then it's crunchy. Show us your points. Ok. Can you participate in a 30 QKAD不行? programme.

Sounds weird. Sounds weird. Sounds weird. Jamie Lee, that was a good strip. Nice. So can you imagine that the drone radio program is more good this in this kind of direction? Well, I don't know whether I... I cannot vote if he would be acting  that. Well, they would get from there right away. They have a, they have a pen. Yeah. In your magic magic, let's do your business. What would you  to do? I'm off-robed, the kind of soul that the world who, not take, look, see it  a little edition. Do you think, I mean, when you describe it that way, it's a sound, not necessarily, what you say, you say, not as an artist, as an artist, yes, I think, if it's easy to do that, you do that? I know, I can, I was very good to do that. I don't think, you can find the event, event, event, third world, that you do, do that. You have to take the frustration, that's certain kind, you don't have to take that thing, that's it. ready to go, a 10 minute curve is correct, so still the whole tail is very calm to catch. Oh, correct. And then he has to say, what's the feeling to that mouse? Well, he challenges all this property. This property, the top, better, is interesting, the most important one to play on the, the big dog there. , when you describe this program, what you do, sounds did it in the way it's on a diplomat's street. diplomat can't use the same exact things on the line. You grab a radio, and stuff. Because it's the same exact thing. Exactly. Yes, many people, man. People are , hey, do you get frustrated? You hold your pockets and devices, and the devices from the camera that I tell, it's just  you Mountain easing, anyhow it's so insane. and if I work on train-fine, then take work on school, if I work on my own way to program, then I do both happy  home. You don't believe you've let out both of my own. Really, you do. I don't believe it. I think that Mark has a radar in his pants from money. Do you think there are many members that come out of court this and out soon? People have fun, they've got it. and if only I could have the job if I were able to spin it out as  that and that'd not be too sometimes.
