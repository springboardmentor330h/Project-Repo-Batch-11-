Today on our program we bring you three stories that families have meal time. When we be easy Chicago, public radio and international, American life in my class. Today's program. You're going to eat that. Three families, three stories and three acts. Act one, breakfast, story of eating and not eating. And what you learn when you view the world through the prison of a single meal, act two, lunch. We hear a father's lament about city cops chewing with your mouth closed and why it is not good to apartheid to the cat. Actory, dinner. We have a story from daybreakers about what family dinners  when the parents are suddenly gone and kids will have to run things themselves. And then there are the stories that are suppressed, disappeared, and Stalin's the runness. There's an extremely false mark to that second camp in the first, they lay dormitory long time for any cheating decided to tell it here. There's produce a jail. There's produce a jail. This morning for breakfast, I had a toast to everything bagel with eggs and cheese and a cup of yogurt. The reporter where I used to work taught me to ask people what they had for breakfast at the beginning of an interview. Now, I'm going to say that it was a good way to set your recording levels. In 1996, Seattle Police Officers faced a tense situation. That's me on the radio in Seattle. I was a reporter for a public station. They didn't pay me or anything. I was just a volunteer, but I was still a reporter. I had a microphone and a tape recorder and I went to press conferences. They put it. It was tear game. I wasn't very good at it. I couldn't stand being told what to say, and I was too powerfully to figure out that it's the truth on myself. And I'm firing he's done, and officers retaliated shooting him nine times. A lot of times, the most revealing response I got from people was what they had for breakfast. And it was the most stupid thing. I'm an E.C.P. for KUW 94.9 public radio. So I decided to follow my instincts and tell a story about breakfast. I got on a plane to New York and I looked at my old friend David. Okay, so I'm telling you what you had for breakfast. Oh my God, you got me. Oh, it adds a non-fat thanks to I.C.P.P.

I met her when I was 15. She was 36 and sometimes I think she saved my life. When she agreed to meet me, I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't seen her in 10 years, and I didn't know if I'd hug her and just feel bones, or if she'd be strong the way I remember her. He turns out, she's had a hard time. She didn't get better, and she almost died. I was going down towards 60-o-croll out of bed out of the futon. There'd be lying there having padding, tag those, I was having hard palpitations. I didn't see her in words, it was hard to breathe. I have to get some food I've got to go through  that all the time. I would go out and get some good news here. I'd call up to the first time opening up, but there are my needs. And I do that at the school. I hope me go through. I take a spoon for a few of my friends. I really feel it. Go down my chest and I'm all solved. This footfucking every ribbed down. dripping off my ribs. The stomach, that something  one, , keeping teeth from the alcohol. Wow, that was juice with me. And that gets dim. Back on me. I'm fine. I met Vivian when I was anorector. We shared a room in a hospital where there were other anorectors. I'd lost my period then, and my breasts, my bones stuck out, and I wanted to die. Vivian called me out of that. She convinced me by example to get better. And so I did. But sitting here looking at her now, I realized that she never planned on getting better. They had to take out, most of my back top, because they were deteriorating. And there was ball loss. It was malnutrition. So they took me out. And I thought this is really great, because now I shoot some singing with that. I thought, oh, oh. Aâyumber charger? Wait. I didn't know I would, I absolutely would. And then he said he has to make me a removable venture. So I said to him when you make it, make it so that back of its stance, it's cheap, so that that cheap smoke. It's my face, it's something. Why is it that big?

She wears a little t-shirt, and you can see the way her stomach sticks out, part is bone, as if someone had inflated her  a balloon. I still think she's beautiful because I hold on to the way she was when I first met her. But listening to her talk scares me, makes me worry that changes impossible, and that we're stuck with who we are. Anorectics are good at PR. They can make you believe anything. I should know. My whole family is good at public relations. My father was even a PR man. They still issue press relations for my illness. My father says, you made us a better family. My mother says, it showed how sensitive and artistic you are. My brother says, in the testament to your better. But I don't know how it turned out. Work, it's over. Or if any of the things they say are true. I have half a class song toasted with peach jam. That's what you make. The non-cooked method. That's my mother. Her recording levels are too hot. She's distorting. Well, I'd buy these calendars for every year and they show a months of the time. on a page. And I've saved them back to the sixties. It's very interesting. I can see in here when Mrs. Boyle is picking you up from school and who's coming to play and dentist appointments. As a reporter, I was taught to get the hard past first. So I start with a written rep. And I see here that all I have on the day, do you wear in the hospital, is it being had a dentist with the anthems? And I also had an appointment at your house. school, which I doubted, but I did put a red star on their Richmond. That was date, which was impossible. There's no written record after all, just a red star and a calendar full of details. It's as though that day never happened. I think it was sort of a denial. I just couldn't believe it. Even though it's not in the calendar, it turns out she remembers everything. I'm not dead. Well, it was a middle of January, it was bitterly cool. But there was something  a ice cream, a terrible ice. There were no cows, you had this very early morning, you refused to put on enough clothing to confront that kind of fall. And so that was horrible. up as it was and you have no socks inside of it. So we had the terrible difficulty with those situations. The struggle with you, trying to convince you, you can find it to someone who just had to get out of there and can't then. So I think I took some extra things with me. Just in case we could persuade you with the mom. And we went outside and people were rushing off to the offices. Keep hearing. and so we were taking the children to school and we couldn't get a child. So we finally went down to the corner and got in the cost town bus. I think all three of us were standing up. We were all over the city. It was very crowded. All three of us were standing up. We were not standing up together. But now that I think about it, this is remarkable that you actually... Stay with us. I mean in the past, it walked away, bleep, and calm. We got off the bus, and I remember, I was somehow walking, so I was six-five. And I was so good, and I tried to pass the street view and was a shiivice. And that was something you were actually, something, and it was extreme. this country is very, of course, the situation is a shame. My mother's story fits my memory of that whole period. Me in the middle of my two parents, slipping in my leopard skin, high heel shoes. My mother doesn't mention what got us there though. In fact, no matter how hard I try to remind her, she won't remember. Do you remember it, when I�üph. to call those pills? Was that before you went in the hospital? Oh yes, I do remember one. It got too pale. How many were in the room and were in the bed? What does happen? What kind of pills were they? That you took? They were antihistimines. I must do. I'm sleepy forever. I'm sleepy forever. I guess. I must have focused on that, but I mean, I... that's just a terrible. Was that in the fall? And what happened, did you bother them and then somehow you woke up? Exclude the clock sound just warm up. did you not take enough or what we didn't have to get any emergency systems? And taking that off. Ah. Now just  then, sometimes the most obvious thing going right at night. I almost was wishing that this wasn't happening and what I otherwise thought was a really idea  I thought, ah everything is so wonderful. So much fun and enjoying everything. I can't believe this is how this will happen. When everything is going so well. Starvation gets people's attention when nothing else will. Anorected snowed out. I knew that. I learned it when I was. I learned it when I was. I, at one time, play all the movements of the four movements. And the reason why I played peace in the first place was that I used to listen to the version of the horror which played when I was sick, I would play it over and over and over and over again in the living room. And my father's son, graph, you remember sitting in his big chair, but it wouldn't. And I would drink this tea that I always drank, I have six of them, freezing off time. And I would eat a carrot because carrots are vegetables that are the lowest in calories. And then I would eat the carrot on top. These carrots have many layers, so we nibble around the outside level level. And then you come to another carrot inside. At five in the morning, when it was still dark, night nurse come by to check on us. I can remember the sound of her keys playing in. She had a face  an owl, short dark hair that was always a little bit grease. At night, she gave out medications in excellent Thailand all for anyone who couldn't sleep. We would line up  fluttering boany birds, hunched over in hospital gowns, waiting patiently for a dose of peace. Then it was snapped on. A canner tube of chocolate sustow help with a skinniest and least fine of us. 10.30 to bed. There's nothing worse when you're sick than to have to lie down with a full stomach. I can remember shaking my legs under the covers, flexing my feet, tightening every muscle to burn up my snap. When I first moved in, I shared a room with a tall blonde. on quite a 10. She was also a nurse. Before she moved into the anorectic ward, she took turns at both jobs. At 12 hour shift at the hospital, and then off on a plane somewhere. She worked 24 hours a day, she said, just to wear herself out. She was the one who taught me how to do aerobics in the closet. We would get up at five together, turn on a radio, just barely enough to hear it, and then we jump up and down in our stops. At seven, the dayn are survived and purged us into the bathroom. We were supposed to get rid of as much as possible before we got way. I remember Vivian standing at the sink drinking cup after cup of water to throw off the scales and convince the doctor she was eating. But this was in the beginning. And I still wanted to starve and expect everyone else to want to too. Way in was some time after the bathroom visit. We'd go down to the room that had a scale and line up outside. One person at a time, I'd stand with my back to the scale because I didn't want to watch the numbers. Afterwards, I'd ask how much. There was always some motion at way in. Someone would start whaling or shaking or screaming. They didn't want to get on the scale. They didn't want to eat. to hell. There we are, we're in a frenzy about our bodies and about facing the clues of the scale. Women with children and husbands, young girls and 20-somethings who look at times 80 and at times  infants. And then it was time for breakfast. T. Pressure, breath, breath, breath, breath. Block, breath, breath, breath. And the half of the vagal strawberry jam. That's my father on a lounge chair in the favorite spot. We're in historic Columbia County. The backyard of our home, we won't be called the Oasis. We've got a pool, a huge tree over there. Lock wall around. the tables, chairs here. So we can get out here if we ever want to. The thing you have to understand about my father is that he grew up poor and then he got rich. There are times you remember when he didn't have enough to eat. Sometimes he even stole food for his dinner. Now he's known for his brilliant gourmet cook. He's offended because absolutely. destroyed me, came close to destroy me, was when you suddenly decided to work on a E. And I couldn't believe that I'd worked all that time and try to provide food and we've gone a lot of the humiliation in the work that is where somebody's your boss, so have things to go fly to about it. We also work the bring home money to help everybody. having a good living, he, with somebody who decides not to eat, that really does store it back in your face. What the hell have I been living for? I mean, there have been trying to help this family, this thing, itself, sacrifice, all the love and stuff. And all of a sudden, somebody who's trying to kill themselves by not eating, he asked yourself, did I have anything to do with this? Anorexia is embarrassing. He embarrassed my father. He humiliated him. The thing is still strikes me. of my memory is the most height of the client, because we had gone out dinner, some rest were long Columbus, and you've got angry at dinner, you used right before the other staff, but because you would need that strength get to the eat, because I thought this girl was gonna lose, she keeps it up, she's gonna starve there, I suppose she's also sweated threatening it right from some迫ons, by starving itself, to death, Well, no, everybody would say something was wrong in that household. The parents had something wrong with it because the child started herself to death. And it must have been terrible that she'd want to start herself to get out of that. So anyway, and I felt  I had an obligation to get to this post-rageral to keep your children alive. So I followed you down the bottom there, but behind the museum, I was just , the man cutting to hurt her. And she was laying down from the plastic. And she was at the hospital. She was given medicines to doctors that haven't answered a thing behind him for 15 minutes. saying, come back, come back have to eat and you've been there. If that's when we are, I would try to take a, and then this man ran up to the and he said to you and me and he looked turned here and he said, what's going on with here? Are you all right? He said to you, I would see you for a little bit of this parent. I mean, it was asking you, yes, he should do anything. It's totally an illegal house, totally straight you're saying. should I be helping you with you? Take this group of men, beating him up, or getting him out of here. We'll be abused by this guy. I'll tell you that was a really good one. What I wanted by whittling myself down to the core was to get my father to see me walk here. to realize that I was separate from him and then he should love me anyway. Maybe even because we were different. That's what I wanted then, although I never told him. Today I had scrambled eggs, toast, raspberries, corn to juice, cough. When I got sick, my elder brother was awake college. Even though he wasn't around that much, he knew something was wrong with me. even before I started to lose weight. And a father hit because of what it meant about me and what it could mean for him. And because it wasn't supposed to happen. It was a little strange because you don't really understand why it just sort of pops up  a mushroom on your lawnmong tape. Suddenly it's there. They're , oh, what is this? But I just didn't understand how we could be so closely related. It's a good interpretation of things. I think I didn't want to think the things weren't fun. I think there was always an emphasis on being a person and a person and a person. I liked that idea. I still did that way in many ways. I couldn't get upset when this happens. The contrary that I'm for, which is all. And I wanted you to. Maybe you... who provided evidence that things  architecture, by the way you were acting. And I was very upset that you were chattering the glass on the on this nice window. One way our family was perfect. I mean, really perfect, was it the breakfast cake? In our family there's a lot of dishes. There's a lot of dishes for different types, courses, 003. So that were. are tables, sometimes I'd love to be so many plates on the table you could barely see the table. Even for a simple breakfast, so no meal was simple, everything was very elaborate, formalized, ceremonial and had a lot of different. It was very complicated. You could never have a simple breakfast. a little bit. No, no, that could never happen. I mean a lot of people  to have corners and not. and I'll have a full breakfast, but I know it's nice. It's a classic experience and it's one that stays with one. Or glass ice. What did that, what did that was for? Well, that goes under the fruit. Or whatever else, what was it for? Oops, dang it. I suppose the whole place is in the middle, that I just  it to look down. And I think it keeps you on the left, even if. You're just passing through and you're called the breakfasts and you sit down over and you think, oh God, another day. But some know it registers or any registers with me. If I have a nice breakfast and I'm not feeling just great, it helps to improve my mood. So I think it's a nice thing to do. And I don't mind for a taste to throw on the table, I  it to more. organized and made and thoughtful and placed. So sometimes people help me and they just kind of scatter it up and table. Would you  some grass-based? We ate in the day room, it was always full of stale smoke and night before. Someone from the kitchen would come up with a contrapional wheels full of trays. Each one with the name on. We take our places, everyone had a special table, a woman had her own where no one else could sit, no one could touch her tray either, talk toward her meals. Our trays came late and with various pre-measured parcels. Melbitose didn't pack it before, plastic containers of raisins and peanut butter, all things that we had gone over with the nutritionists the day before. I remember sitting in a rock. He talks in the afternoon. She take out a calculator in the next day's menu and say, What do you want to eat tomorrow? I don't know. I don't want to eat tomorrow. Every day there was a schedule. Mostly meals interspersed with activities  dance there, and art there, some snacks and teeth. At night after dinner, we'd sit around in a circle next to the television, holding hands and listening to music. A few of us would cry, some people would smoke cigarettes and then we'd go to bed. But went on  that for a while until one morning the doctor said he'd put me on the tube if I didn't start eating. I remember leaving his office and turning down the hall and seeing some girls there who were taking turns walking up and down judging each other's thighs. Each one said her is more bigger, but none of them were. and a dawned on me then, that if I kept going, I might never come back. And so, I lunch that day. I asked the girl next to me if she dared me to finish what was on my plate. She did. And from that day on, I ate, and they finally let me out on April Fool's Day, 1988. I think I had some flowers and will when I'd done. put your favorite sheets up in the bed and you're seen pleased by that. But I very quickly realized how fragile we're, but the health book that was that while you were fragile, you also seemed so appreciative of my health. And there were times when it was so overwhelming that you would just collapse and suffer. often, bad. And, , remember the nice thing was that, , that I actually felt that I could be helpful to me. And so sometimes I just sit and talk to you and, , and afterwards you say, well,  what? I've done a pretty short course. Bye. Bye. because it was so different than it had been six months before when it was impossible to reach you. So, well, anyway that was a wonderful journey. It was a wonderful journey. When I came home, I ate my breakfast somewhere else until eventually, got easier. And I started to sit at the table. across my brother again. There were still a lot of plates and we didn't talk about what it happened. In fact, we haven't really talked about it until now ten years later. Oh, I was actually some kind of journal about this, this was just a... , except for a while, your memories are selected today. Remember the first time? To tell you the truth, I'm pretty hard on my parents and the part they played in my illness. But looking back on this. time, I also think about my mother. And how she kept trying, no matter how often I retreated into my body and refused her help. She sat with me and waited until I was ready to face up to my feelings. I mean, any feel. I'll try to. The same area where I made the mistakes before, I can't remember how to get out of the mistakes. I mean, there's a certain chord, and then if I play that chord, then I can get out of the mistake I'm gonna make, but I can never remember which chord is. I still don't know if I'm completely better. They're times even now when I prefer hard bones over soft and some sorrow. When I don't want to know this. For instance, I never asked my brother if I could interview him with a story. I thought he might embarrass me, or tell me something I didn't want to hear. It was my mother who told me later that he felt left out, and that I should talk for. Yeah, I think that's just so played into all the feelings I had in the time when I was, well, I'm not wearing everything I've been asked. I'm not going to go over and ask you , why haven't you interviewed him after they had the soon news? Well, because I don't feel it's my place to , come in and , oh. I'm gonna see you in a few because I feel  if you have to ask it would be very it was it felt the meaning to me and I feel  you should have as a reporter just look for all the sides of the story. I mean you want some selective version what happened and you were afraid I was going to bring up some I have to admit I did want my brother to come to me. Yeah I was in some ways anorexia was about having other people come to me. I wanted relationships on my turn. My father's  that too. When I was still in the hospital and I was starting to get better, I called him up and asked him if he'd take me to the movies. He said he'd take me if I gained half a pound, and so we didn't go. Trying to force each other. Five each other. We've locked it in some battle. Ask your inspiring thoughts. This is what dive we'll tav in buried in. Here I am. alls. sebagai to google, go buy the guns! God's, besides punishments, heaps. We're in that comfort. The heaps are presumably thinking we're doing all the right things, going to private school, being able to afford what we were able to afford, buy things, having and materialies successful life. But instead of the... I mean, some kind of reverence for each other. But tell you, times I think the only thing that makes a difference is passing past you, time. You may call kind of mistakes, but time passes somehow. Things get cured a little bit. I'm not sure. Yeah. Well, I'll take it as a movie. Okay. Tell me what you had for breakfast. I had anxiety, and I was very thin coding of agitate. And it was coupled with a cup of very lukewarm pseudo-coffert in the form of connected present. After I finished interviewing my parents, I went back to talk to Vivian again. And I asked her how she felt and if she thought she'd ever get better, she said she realized finally what she'd done and how her body would never be the same again. I realized I've watched him back to Vivian. I'm getting all. I curb myself, I'm falling all. And ... I should. Ten seconds later, she told me this. I, , desperate we want to lose weight. I am desperate. I could tell you she's going to find a way out, and I could tell you she's never going to change, and both things would be different. And she told you the same thing. As for me, I've started going out with my microphone looking for stories that I want to tell. I talked to one woman named Louise who started making hats out of carpet scraps and she was diagnosed with skin cancer. And they really do a good job at that he'll buy a cancer. She told me she's really excited about the rest of her life because she finally feels she can be herself and passed the nightingale. And see how something I've died. And whether I want you or not. She played the piano for me, song she learned when she was 12 and still remembers. Here's her, the song had grown. I went out and got the sheet music for the shoe on please. I even played it and gotten past that chord.

Of the juices and other beverages, yes even of those in city tops you may drink, but not in the living room. Not in the living room, you carry such a daring. Indeed, when you reach the place where the living room carpet begins of any food or beverage there, you may not eat neither may you drink. You are sick and aligned down watching something. Then... you make me in rhythm. And if you are seated in your eye chair or in a chair such as a greater person might use keep your legs in feet below you as they were. Neither raise up your knees nor place your feet upon the table for that is an abomination to me. Yes, even when you have an interesting bandage to show your feet upon the table are an abomination and worthy of your view. Keep your milk as it is given to you, Mark. to use on it and pencil for a knife and your spoon, but that's not what they are for. If you will dip your blocks in the milk and lick it off, you will be sent away. When you have drunk, let the empty cup then remain upon the table to not write a punch edge and by your teeth hold it through your face and order to make noises in it, sounding  a duck, then you will be sent away. When you chew your food, keep your mouth closed and do a swallow, and do not open it to show your brother or your sister what is within, I say to you do not so, even if your brother or your sister. on the same to you. Eat your food home. Do not eat that which is not food. And I've seen the table between your jaws, and I use the rain, and I've been able to wipe your lips. I say again to you, do not touch it, but believe it, it is. And though your stick of parrot doesn't eat resemble a marker, do I not with it upon the table, even in pretend for we do not do that that is why. Though the pieces of broccoli are very light, I believe we are very light. maltreaty do not stand in my bright make force because we do not do that. That is why. Sit just as I have told you and do not leave one side of the other or slide down into your nearly slit away. Eat me for if you sit  that your hair will go into the serum. And now behold, even as I have said to his come to please. So we judge between the plate that is a clean plate that is being said first the plate is clean then you shall have dessert The unclean plate for laws are these If you have eaten most of your meat and two bites of your peas with each bite system If not less than three peas each or in total 6-be even where I can see You have also eaten enough of your potatoes to fill two forks both forks eaten where I can see Then you shall have dessert But if you eat a lesson number of pins. And yet you eat the potatoes. Still, you shall not have dessert. And if you eat the peas, yet leave the potatoes uneven, you shall not have dessert. No, not even a small portion, there are. And if you try to deceive by moving the potatoes or peas around with a fork, that it may appear, you eat them, but you do not. You will fall, nicked. And I will know, you shall have dessert. Do not scream, where it is as if you scream all the time. high. You are given a plate in which two feet you do not wish to touch each other, are touching each other. Your voice rises up even to the ceiling. While you point to the offense with the finger of your right hand, but I say to you, scream not. Only remonstrate gently with the server that the server may crack the fall. Likewise, if you receive a portion of fish from which every piece of herbal seasoning is not been scraped off and the herbal seasoning is loaded some to you, steeped in violence. Again, I say refrain from screaming. Though the biomass overwhelm you, how do you have faint unto death, make not that sound from within your throat, neither cover your face or press your fingers to your nose. For even now, I have made the fish as it should be. Behold, I eat of it myself. Get do not die. Cast your countenance upward to the light, lift your eyes to the hills that I'm in. Or easily wash you all. For the stay. Their puns are upon you even to the very back of your head. There is rice there on. And in your breast pocket of your garment and upon the pie of your shoe, rice and other fragments distributed in a manner wonderful to see. Only pull yourself still. Hold still, I say. Give each finger in its turn for my examination thereof. You can also eat some. Low, how aniquitous they appear. What I do is as it must be. You shall not go hence. So I have done. Light not. Rest you be cast to quiet burn. Now, the drink of your own bath water, no bath water of any kind. No rub your feet on bread even if it be in the package. No rub yourself against cars, no against any building. No, eat sand. Leave the cap alone. But what has the cap done that you should so afflict it with tape? And hum not that humming in your nose as I read. So stand between the light and the book. Indeed, you will drive me to madness. Well, forget what I said about the tape. Oh, my children, you are disobedient. For when I tell you what you must do, you argue and dispute hotly, even to the littlest detail, and when I do not exceed, you cry out and hit and kick. Yes, and even sometimes do you spit and shout stupid head and other blasphemy and hit and kick the wall and emolding their out when. or sent to the corner. And though the law teaches that no one shall be sent to the corner for more minutes than he has years of age, yet I would leave you there all day, so mighty M.I. in anger. But upon being sent to the corner you asked straight away, can I come out and I reply, no, you may not come out, and again you ask, and again I give the same reply. But when you ask again a third time, then you may come out. Hear me, oh my children, for the bills, they kill me. I pay and pay again, even to the . time in a year, yet again they mount higher than before. For our health that we made it covered, I give 620 palanst 12 pines in a year, but even this cover is not the 1500 Dr. Willke-Reach member of the family within a calendar year, and yet for ordinary visits we still are not covered, nor for many medicines, nor for the teeth within our mouths. It's not that what rage is in my mind for surely. Can I know? For I will come to you at the first of the month and at the 15th of the month with the bills and the great one. in my mind, and when the months of taxes comes, I will decry the wrongs and unfairness of it, and mourn with wine and astraise and rend my receipts. And you shall remember that I am that I am before, after, and until you are 21. Hear me then, and avoid me in my wrath, O children of me. ! In followers, AH E.S.
