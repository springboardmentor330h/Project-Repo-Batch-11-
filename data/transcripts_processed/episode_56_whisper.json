  "text": "When my grandmother, Malik Palatza, is 32 years old, she lets it. So sick that she was in hospital for months, so sick that the doctor thought she would die. So sick, that's finally, and all seem to fit. They call her a rabbit. They need change to me. As my mom explains, The reason the rabbit said that they changed her name was to the one angel that she was. She was, and it was take her. It's such a beautiful picture of a danger of death. It's a danger of death to be so easily fooled. Danger of death is stupid. Danger of death is  the UPS. No, it says here is the address. God name. Are you sure she's not here? I don't  if they put the wrong name tag on you in the hospital. Is wrong operation. So my grandmother changed her name. It's a full-day-end tour. And it worked. She's five, got well. Change from the impact to what it was. Live to the age of 87. Something so medieval about this story. So I'm  my family actually my family, which basically discarded the old world, another day that got off the boat. But I think it's... easily believe that there's something magical when you change your name. , you change your name, you become a new person, take on a different identity, start over again, clean slate. Even in the way it's very American impulse. It's the new world, it's the new of Westward, it's divorce and self-help, 12 step programs and Ellis Island all loaded along. It's the way of Marilyn Monroe and Andy Warhol. Muhammad Ali. in the next. We are disformable in those prints. Welcome to BB-ease Chicago with the American Life in my request. Today on our program name changes, some done in innocence, some done to con people. Back one, C-JR F2, baby remember my name, which a 17-year-old tricks an entire risk. The short town is proving that he is someone that he is not. Act 3, as seen on television, the story of a guy who got booked onto the David Letterman show, didn't want to go. He got a friend to take his name. He's going his place. Successfully. Act 4, known to plume, how a guy named Tom came, came and enjoyed. He was , what he gained, what he lost. That. See you guys. Porcupicum. Back one. Procedure. In Los Angeles, two legally-changed-your-name. You show up at the LA Civil Code House of Fibononds before nine. There's your Friday. Go to room 208. This apartment one A. It works  this. You file a petition to change your name. That costs 189 bucks. You pay about 85 dollars to publish your name change in the newspaper. If you're changing your kids. You need to prove that it's okay with the other parent, or prove that you have searched for the other parent and you cannot find them. And you have to fill out a form, so they can check to make sure that you're not a registered sex friend. Imagine a line of department and motor vehicles. That's what this line looks . Several teenage girls in white or black jeans, long nylon coats, heavy makeup, and long long crimp tear. A few couple stand, holding hands, and look to each other for assurance. We send right or wrong to watch the proceedings. Friday. 17 people showed up. It was a youngest black guy with an afro, baggy pride and pants and better droop kids, changing his name from Damon Washington to the Moni and Dea Sativa. Avian amizman named Sunny Taeang, changed his name to Sunny Thomas Roo, a school teacher named Carolina Anderson between David Carr and Anderson, for your little teacher gave it a name. It means Angel Princess. But more than half the people who come here. A Mothers. We want to change your children's names. Apparently they don't want to be reminded of the acts he isn't around. Where is the Marguerac on? To describe the scene, what you saw. Even without being told, people follow the rules of any legal proceeding. If they speak, they speak softly. For 15 minutes I sit in this room watching a line of people one after the other speak to the court clerk, a young woman who looks a lot  him go over. from the OJ Simpson trial. Mostly the court clerk asks and answers questions. She examines their papers and says things , Are you as mother? The minutes tick by and each of the people are addressed in the same kind, helpful tones, and then they walk out the door. And then at a certain point I realize something. This is it. There's no more to this proceeding. In my mind, I'd imagine that the filing of the papers was going to be followed by some. of swearing in causes. the kind of happens when you become an American citizen. I picture the group of people standing up with their right hand raised in a judge banging the gable and then making them repeat some official oath. Although I'm not sure what that could be. I knew name goes here, solemnly square, that I will answer to my new name and know other, so help me God. Where the judge sets, there's only an MP. She chair in a nameplate that says, Murray Gross Commissioner. Later, I asked the clerk why the judge isn't around and she says, oh he is. He's been her all day long, he's in the back, and then she waves her hand in the direction of a room behind her. The thing is, I look through the open door and I only see a secretary wandering around. And immediately, I think of the great and powerful eyes. There's no Murray Gross, I think. And while you're in a new place, if you want to get your name changed, you deal with this clerk. Her name is Robert. She's a town. About five deep into the line, there's a tall, thin elderly woman with a fuzz of grey hair whose stance is patiently as the rest. She wears all white. A long white sweater, white sheer stockings, white shoes, and an ankle length, crisply iron, pleaded white skirt. There's something about her that immediately kept her. to sure I. She's the only one to lie where it accramed, a beat of one, gold and blue. This is her holiness of Bryant. Her name used to be Olivia, she tells me, but in 1981, God told her to change her name. She wouldn't say why. To her holiness, and she respectfully complied. Ever since then, everyone in the retirement home where she lives calls. her for holiness or nothing at all. What did they call you for short I ask her? And she smiles dreamily at me. That's it, no answer. Her holiness has definitely dealt with bigger smart Alex than myself. Somewhere from the foals of her all-white costume, she pulls out a small black letter wallet. And she shows me her social security card and her driver's license, and they both say, her holiness is so bright. Then she slides the cards back into the wallet, and just her crown with it. tiny tap of her long skinny fingers and then she disappears off down the cord hallway. Watching this whole thing is hard to believe how simple it is to change something that has been so much a part of your life for so long. Something that seems irrevocable. This thing you've had since birth. And when they walk out of the courtroom, people have an expression that I've only seen in one And it phrase this It's the what just happened expression of newly grads after they've been married in a poochy wedding in Las Vegas. So much anticipation has come before this, so much thought has been invested on the road to this moment. That all happen so quickly, they don't know what to feel. They assume they're going to feel different, but they don't feel different. Just now. Sometimes they actually say it out loud to rob her, they lean towards her and whisper. Is that it? That's it. says moving on to the next outfit. Mikey Bakuan, in Los Angeles, more name changes coming up.

It's hard for people to understand that it's one one for the ones that you can send me on. , where everybody had to read it for one of their easy. Especially if you were a 17 year old guy. No, no, no. Person group of American teenagers and college students, national anthunes, what's said it in that live, would be John Bush, would be that. But some of the early Saturday night, right up, staff, painting that. One of the nine print writers was a guy named Christopher Sir, this next story is now, Jacket, no one don't, deciding as a teenager to take Christopher's name for the year 19th, or for himself. My buddy Mr. Hit into his studio and his fair. Sir, the fix me out of all the writers who picked his stuff, especially when you don't hear of that. You have so much confidence. This research sign this video session is to interview Jack, get an album to the smoke that you can definitely met. Christine, very happy to be asked. Jack, it's very, very happy to tell the story. The whole story starts in the summer of 74. I was seven years old, arising senior in high school. And my friend Jimmy had a country house in the high-wanton North Carolina, this little town called, he was provide. And on the way up, we were just talking about all the people he sort of had gotten to know over the years up there. He must have the families. So in the fairly wealthy, well, to do people. And he knew a lot of the kids and stuff, the other, teenage. So somehow it would be in the tube. us became up with the idea that I would just be somebody else to and we just have a couple of days fun,hood-making everybody with pretending that I was somebody I wasn't. So we were reading a couple of different articles and we came across one of yours. All those names, by the way, have to remember, that your name, or your name, or your name, Dom, he was named all those names, or to a 17-year-old male, in 1974, these were the names of gods. I'm on it. I'm on it last year. And last summer, it makes on the night. It only took 23 years. It's only was, we decided to have you. And we decided to work in the 18th century. We promised that we could have a lot of things. And we just introduced this person. And it became a conversation in solid but , I began to read it. It's a church. And I'm on it last year. and I was a cute, ear-carb in my spare time, and I was screaming as a random person. Of course, to save that, to save Christmas or a name, , that rhyme was, everyone got. Everyone got to know that. But it's a pure, Christopher's Surve. Say yeah. I've seen my stuff by writing, writing, writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, and writing, anyway, went over, went over. way to, , within 48 hours, I was the hottest, , commodity on the level. It's fine. So let me just send being you for those first three from me. It's just absolutely, that's for a couple of, couple of things. It means because, because I'm for that, , we need some of what things. We need to be laughing, and Joe, we need some more time. I didn't think of any work at all. , I was sort of used to being, and I really put a lot of big show, did the small smile. Anything you said? Got it. He cried. actually. But what it is is that you had actually,  why I hear what I was lying for. No, no, just that you made me up. Right, okay. And I was giving you a good assumption. Oh good. And I realized now that I've been a magazine ready to perform. Did it come so far? That advice was actually going to be a good one. That's all I'm going to say. Is everybody who's career that I helped a lot? That we got that you can tell me that now that made it? I don't think that it's a good one. I do remember what I mean, part of the girls are lying in my eyes. It's clear that one of these girls wanted to be my regular date. I was going to be up, I was going to be a summer car, a summer. I, that night, one thing led to another and so from fell in me. I was , good looking, good man, one. Amazing picture. Oh, all I remember is that we did neck, because the record is a room. Yeah, so we're bleeding, bleeding, and the belt. Ah, that was very interesting. With your fame, I got to neck with this really beautiful. That's what makes you so damn it. Because that's my girl. I love church. She's mine. Because I say, it raises me that the story is that never worked for me. I didn't say I'm Chris surfing, people didn't say, wow. It was probably as you were hanging out with Seth. I should've got it. Oh, that's true. I'm going to see the guy in the mirror. I knew it. But... Did anyone ask you to stop? Would you go up to this question? First of all, I knew the entire ring. And this you. one up until whatever month it was. But there was one thing, there was one guy who was in more information than I was in the beginning. He lived out of her name, but I'm not even sure what he was doing. I lived out of her name, but I probably wouldn't be stuck in the slot in the back. And he read this in person. Because he just knows. But , it first he was very excited. And it's just going on, I signed copies. And it's been a good time anyway. So of course I would always interact with him. He was a great guy. But he knew everything. And I remember it's growing important to me as a house. Why does something happen? See it. Okay, we'll see. remember this one or brighter how did you get the idea for this all right and then one point you call something that you personally wasn't in order to do it but I mean if they've really blown you're not crazy you're not crazy you're not crazy you're not crazy because I knew you nice then you love as soon as he was in on the job then I mean he was He was part of the prime then he was one. That actually I would respond to this. It happens with folks who see it. Once one person gets it, then they're not. But having a confederate. Yeah, definitely made it okay. He was serving. He was serving. He was serving. What else did I do besides right? What else did I do besides right? What else did I do besides right? Well, it was a junior part. And I was made reading the English and I was  I'm ever saying  it was the thing about the first thing I was able to do. I do that. No, he came up to tutor. Oh yes, right. Good. So where did you go? What's the heart? You had a right? Oh yeah. I said, may done. Oh, okay. Actually, you might want the heart to live. Yes. A lot of swords, so that wasn't. And then we figured that can be the wrong thing. Right. Let's start. What's up? SUJAN I think so. I'm going to say maybe I should just give it that to you. But, I don't want to make people are in extreme trouble so that's what really means. because the psychic way of having to carry around all the huge delections and lots of time. Two cool, I thought, would settle on how she's exhausted. I think that's just really hard for me. It was hard to get into the past, I was tired about people. Counting tips on how to get into red, bonking, all things that needs to be set up. Was there any friends? Yeah, they're the special citizens. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What if you were real? Well, you would have to tell them. I didn't tell the one. We didn't. That's awesome. I'm not going to get this. It's not. It's not. It is a week of tongue. It will be released. Ah, ah. In the... Ah, it's all... The most sitting in the half of the whole process. It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... Ah... In the... On... On... Is there... First this in the first episode. Oh, no. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Jack hated Christopher Serve. 1974 when Jack hated spooned his prank, circusing his early 30s living in Patton, going to parties where no one ever, he sensed, gave him this kind of graduation. He became a relative for Sesame Street, offered the song, the letter B, and many other well-known Sesame Street songs. And says that he was in on Pissure, a prank's also. Well, I've always got to say something. Correct me, so we can be violent, sir. I've agreed that whether our books and records and things work  the book and commercializing the book and you want to make it very clear for the words and the words and the things that should be in this institution. And for us to write a book and some people that show us the work show and listen to the so-called mannequin. I don't know, Joe Reposo. I was thinking about the things that I decided you would make the most commercial products and he possibly imagined this joke. Please film temperature and rails of your acquaintance, Joe. and David Chiget, who was the first person to be a Christmas party. He had to tell that friend who was a butcher. So we made up Sesame Street Imperial Polish Philvassas. He had a little picture of 15 miles through the crowd saying, it better than cookie. And we obviously had to do much time in those days, because big bird and cookie lesson chaos, being frank, I was made a series of radio spots. Fake ones, and then we had the band, we spent a lot of time on this show. We had labels printed. and it had a little disclaimer on it saying this educational solution to such an issue. And we made up about 100 of them to give out a Christmas sign. And a few days before Christmas we put them in the refrigerator in lunchroom. And my one-ball whole that night because you had a trip down and decided they were real. This was a real product of it. It then done a legally on the slide. It was just  the whole thing we were talking about. Everyone came up and we were just laver were there as young days  that. It's going to have the words for such a job. He crazy. They thought it was really a manatee and tea out of the interior sausage company. We were always wondering, do you mean, to do it in the Dunn Breast? Oh, right. And , they were looking for it. We just kept saying, when I said, I had a happy family guy in Mill Valley. We claimed to be dominant in Turialli. Who had family scum, he called John Pony to attack, but talked of it with the license. Then we had a radio station said, how are the spots? Saying, are you sure you really want to run these? And then John got a call from him. the winks, the sausage, month and magazine, I feel  for an interview. And it just went on, and finally, at the very end, we dressed the entire chest and we stand up, leader-hows, and they came with tubas, so I played very Christmas dorm, and we gave her the sausages and best stock.

I've got a house and a shop name. One can get no place with you. We have four people. They have written sound right up to the right. They have written sound right up to the right. They have written sound right up to the right. Let's go back to the stage. We did, but what we just did, I've been from so many times, I've been from many times. Robert Hammer and Mitzuchi, But now I'm going to go from college. Can get started with you. Coming up, story day before the moment, we'll be here. So far. It's a minute. This American life, my request, which we can offer to the course which is a theme, write a variety of writers, and form a tackle that the short stories, writing monologues, essays, the occasional radio play, what a week of. Today's program, name change. And when the video staff and I started to assemble stories for today's show, all the stories in the devider. into two basic types. The stories about people who change the name, this is new vibe, new beginning. And the stories about people changing the name, probably in the perpetrator, Kong, Sondol. This next story falls into the second category. Though it's a very small Kong. Very innocent Kong. It's hurt. Property is damaged,  the feelings were wounded. This about is innocent, Sondol as they Kong. What these guys do essentially? is a pure and david Adam's show under a false name  that name. We've arrived at a three of our program, a scene television. When I was first told to expect an invitation for pure and david Adam's show, I only response was thanks but no thanks. This is dish washer. After the scene part dishwasher, you don't just try to have to explain what is the scene is. Okay for those of you who have not seen the scenes are scenes are these little , self-published, ofms. you ask, magazines. This particular one that counts the young, the real life adventures of dishwasher. It's on going quest wash dishes in every state union. It's a combination diary and philosophical inquiry into the nature of dish washing, what it means to wash dishes with it. And it's so well written and funny and provocative that it has gotten some attention for the mainstream material is od the regime. Back when reporters from newspapers and magazines first started contact me, I did a couple of interviews. One resulting article was So Hoki. Hey, look at this wacky guy. That naturally made its way into newspapers around the country. Before long, I began to get exasperated with media folks. Then came the final straw. Reducer from CNN somehow tracked down my parents' phone number. I'm called them three times a week for nearly a month, urging my folks to have me, call him. I made the call, but I happened to mention. my apprehension towards the media. He took it personally and became defensive. He explained that he was down with the cause, his very words, and didn't always work for the man. But was forced to, because he had a mortgage-free family to feed, and get this, had to put shoes on his chosen feet. I couldn't make the sacrifice ride, who's actually implying that if I didn't do the interview with him, and his two daughters were going to go barefoot, I had enough. I got nothing wrong with him at all. in the stationary of some big media outlet from Los Angeles for Europe. They were in straightened garbage here. I don't know. But at some point, a friend of Pete's just held your said that he would love to be in the shoes. He'd love to be in the shoes. He'd be good. Why the pride in this team? I'm sitting in another office in a new college ass. I'm just going to go with the team. Soon, I'll let her run. Let him show. I got... F***! in a, , some sort of old, , 1960's Barbara Streisand Ryan and Neil Moodle soon, a letter arrives in the mail from the bottom of the show. He pecked to his promise, having just a personate on national television stars here is concerned. Had to be appealing things to it. Number one, just get a free trip from Europe, keeps living time and doing it and paying out. Number two, free food. Number one! the original quantity of it, backstage of the gluttony show, he would just tag along on tape. Because if there was going to be free food, then I was going to be right there beside him. And here, our saga begins. The gluttony show was so excited to book this recipe. They heard it throughout the whole possible day. That, , they talked to Jess, he and his people, right? Every day for a week. And when guests can't just have a blessing, we show that we're just going to go through that very day. We're watching. I met him at the airport and we rode into the city in a stretch of the missing. At the hotel, just was greeted grimly by the staff of the desk. They remembered him from the week before when he had difficulties trying to squeeze a room to pass it out of him. They wanted a credit card. He didn't have one. They wanted $150 cash just didn't have it. But both parties frustrated. They had agreed. on a $20 cash deposit. But this time, Jess was determined to not even give up that much. Oh yeah, I remember you, desperate, humble. Jess told them that if they wanted a deposit, they'd have to get it from the Letterman Show. When they called the show, whoever was on the other hand, while saying that they would cover the deposit, apparently explained that Jess was a dishwasher. It clerk snorted, oh, is that what he does? I emptied the candy edition to my pocket and we wouldn't upstairs for a sweet. We spent the rest of the night goofing around in the hotel's gym and roaming about in our complimentary blue-y white robes, creating food service trays left in the hallways. I slept for only a couple of hours before getting up around 6am. Just was still awake, writing letters. Later in the morning, I went downtown to pick up my disguise. Assute. I slowly made my way back up to Midtown. When I reached the hotel room, Jess looked a bit worried, having just completed a series of phone calls with Letterman staff. In the weeks prior, they had been asking Jess to send them more issues with dishwasher, and while Jess kept telling them he would, he never did. The more issues they had meant the more material Jess would be responsible for knowing as his own. But now, Jess had just learned during the previous days they had a researcher working to track down any information by or about them. So we had no idea what they'd come up with, what just would have to answer to. And worst of all, we didn't know if they had found a photo of me. Before the phone could ring again, we took a few beers and snuck up onto the roof of the 55-story hotel. We set up their devising elevise to explain why Jess was Pete, even if her photo might identify me as Pete. Satisfied with our arsenal of defenses and hungry from fasting all day in preparation for the free EATS. It was time. to go. We went downstairs to the waiting limo with its thick neck driver and thicker neck bodyguard. The studio is right around the corner from the hotel. The distance can be covered on foot in two or three minutes and even I with my slow pace and my knee to check the payphone for quarters that have made the trekking five minutes. But with midtown Manhattan's traffic locked in rush hour gridlock and all the one-way streets working against us took a full half hour to make the trip in the limo scene. Outside the studio, small crowd gathered around the limo, expecting a start to emerge. I had hoped just what appeased autograph seekers, signatures  Jacques Gusto, Jesus Christ, when instead he bolted from the car and blew right through the crowd, just  a real start. Inside the building, we were shown around the stage before being led upstairs to the dressing room where someone asked me to be here. Sure, Jess said, how does a bunch of important beer sound the offer was supposed to impress us in the sad truth is we were impressed. Sounds good, Jess said. And what do you guys want to eat? I'll go down to the deli and get whatever you want. This offer caught us off guard since we had assumed full spread of food would have been awaiting us. So we are unprepared to place an order. And when Jess gave his simple request, she sandwiched and nearly screamed, anything, we could have anything from the deli. And the cheese. sandwich for you too, she asked me, yeah, I said hungry, but , a lot of things on it, that's supposed to be awesome. Yeah, a lot of stuff on mine too, just added. Soon as she left, we closed the door and I felt relieved that we survived that first hurdle with relative ease. Then stealthily, just handed me a scrap paper which read, it's in cameras, I could talk to you. Game yet, you never know, if you're soon passing notes, whispered. After only a few minutes of privacy, the talent coordinator entered. She walked right up to me and said, P, to shook my head and pointed her in Jess's direction. She shook Jess's hand, but then turned back to me. Wait a minute, hear the guy in the photograph? Damn, they had dug up a picture of me. He just poses for the photo sometimes, Jess said, his explanation didn't dampen her suspicion, and she kept staring at me. While I could say was, he's peat, not me. My name's Jerry. She was far from convinced. Really guys, what's going on here? Simultaneously, just so I began rambling varied and conflicting stories. Apparently, we hadn't settled on exactly which alibi we would use. The whole mission was on the brink of doom, but somehow we were able to confuse her to the point where she seemed to resign that, the slate stage, so close to show time. As in her interest, three main ignorant. The interrogation ceased while she made small talk with Jess. After each question posed to Jess, she looked at me, as if to gauge any reaction I may have had to Jess's responses. I did my best to disappear from her thoughts, or remained silent, stared at the window in faint boredom. When the talent coordinator finally to the seat, she didn't sit on chair me or on the couch proper  Jess, rather she straddled the arm of the couch, with the arm being much higher than the seat of the couch. and with her wearing a mini skirt, there was suddenly plenty of eye-level exposed flash inches away from Jess's face. It didn't appear to be accidental. When her chat was just turned flirtatious, I realized she was trying to use her sex appeal to get him to relax, this tactic backpired, instead of being relaxed, just seemed uneasy with her presence and the attention she was giving her. It began to sweat. The flirting continued for another 10 minutes until she unexpectedly turned to her focus on me, asking about my life, who I was, what I did, where I was from. My alias was simple. Jerry, a graphic designer from Soho, but the questions kept coming as if to chip me up, and I found myself struggling to explain who this Jerry character was. When she finally seemed satisfied with my answers, and returned her attention to Jess, I quietly breathed a sigh up relief. Then the much anticipated food arrived from the... in the talent coordinator left the room. We hope to relax with our eats, but no sooner had she left than in-walked the segment producer. The segment producer showed Jess six questions he had prepared for Letterman's ask, and six prepared answers Letterman could expect to hear from Jess. To make sure Jess would know what to say on the air, the segment producer had Jess's study prepared answers, and they conducted a pop quiz. Okay, now say Letterman asked you question number three, how are you going to respond? Suddenly, Jess was rehearsing lines. All the while, I quietly ate my sandwich and drank my beer and watched the show on Monat. The show time rapidly approaching, we left the dressing room and headed downstairs towards the stage. In the tiny green room beside the stage, we sat watching the show on the monitor until the segment producer announced it was finally time. rose, winked, and disappeared. I made quick work in devouring the strawberries and grapes, and fruitball, and was moving in on a plate of gourmet cookies, and the television screen faded from black. Suddenly, there was Jess without the obligatory walk across the stage entrance. Already sitting next to Letterman. Folks, Letterman said, Our next guest has spent the past 10 years working towards his ultimate goal to wash dishes in every state in the union. Here he is, the true American patriot, dishwasher peek. I dropped my cooking So hard I slid off the couch. One of the other two people in the green room asked, Is that your friend? Yeah, I cried between fits. And that's really his goal to watch dishes in all 56. Yeah! That's very strange. Yeah, I said again, but then realized that this bozo was calling my friend just strings. No wait, who's calling me strings, I can fuse for a moment, but then the chuckling overwhelmed me again. I no longer carey. Black thing almost none stop. I cut almost. none of the interview until I realized Letterman steering just towards doing his fire-hand trick. I just had lobbied to staff all along to let him do this trick. They had been so skeptical. I was sure they wouldn't allow him to do it. Now, Beat, as I understand, to while away sometimes, the lonely hours of the kitchen, you taught yourself sort of a little kind of a trick and, in time to time on this show, that's something called sleep of human tricks. And I think this falls right smack in the middle of that category. Well, yeah, actually, I'm licking the plates. That's what it is. You've got to get three foods too. They don't pay enough. But yeah, I wanted to, one of the tricks that I wanted to do is, well, after an accident, I had, I sliced my hand open. I don't know if you see it. Well, I don't know if I want to see the sliced feed, but I don't think you're worried about it. It's a five and a half inch star. It's from his slicing my hand open. I had nerve surgery in and my hand is dead. But I keep doing it. You have to show the story. How is that happening? What? But I can  to grab some cigars by catching my hand. and then on fire and putting him up to the smoking. He can catch his hand on fire, but we didn't  place. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Light's dimned. Letterman put a cigar in his mouth, and failed to notice just lighting not his scarred left hand, his right hand. Just rust the flaming hand at Letterman's face, who could only jump back and fright his cigar and lit. APPLAUSE I got scared. I saw a guy. with a dead flaming hand, lunging at me. It is a portfolio. It's a lucky happy. Thank you. And then, before I knew it, it showed us over and I was alone in the green room. Immediately, I passed on the refrigerator at an outnote beer. In fact, there was nothing edible in the whole room besides the gourmet cookies. I was searching for a container to stash the cookies in, when Jess poaked his head through the door just long enough to say . Hey, let's get out of here. But wait Jess, I yelled, cookies. But he was gone. I grabbed as many cookies as I could cradle in my arms and cut up to him at elevator. Back upstairs, I rushed to the bathroom while Jester was leaving his step in the dressing room . We charged down the stairs, past the letterman's office, past his waiting minions, and finally, outside. Jess led the charge, past the crowd, knocking inside at least one autograph book and held out for him to sign. People were shouting my name. Inside it, I seemed very soon. friends in the crowd. But then I saw a pack of fat boys emerge from the mass and rush towards Jess. P, P, P, P, P, L. Terrified, Jess dove in the limousine, slammed the door. Following day, let him in staff found out that they've been duped. Several curious friends pop sure find out one of them. For a couple of weeks we weren't sure if we were going to see the 500 dollars they would ask for their parents. But as we turned out, let them ensure they are very cool, as little customers as possible. So we were paid without having raised customers. Now, let them ensure that they are not coming. Desperately ? SIS Bah This was a piece story about the government show here in the Zine dishwasher. You want to get a copy? Right? This address? Scrap pen? This washer? Heo box? 8213. Corp. And Oregon? 972. 7. What is sacrifice in the change in your name? 3bap? can you take another? More bets. I'm sorry this question will listen to the next act that for Norm De Plum Norm together. One of the most original music writings is not right. It's from Max and Zad Stin, from Smith. But actually this is my from Max in Zad All. His name and completely name quotes it with his name. His name is Hamden Joy. He prints his opinions of posters which he has to solve with in Europe. Obviously his little pamphlets, which had his  the last manifesto's Hamden Joy. But your listeners may remember hearing him when I'm frank so now. After show who had a story for us about watching, movie the men show you and candidate, and a TV and a Bob West Rock, which is Tabby's, Sarah Vow, one of our favorite methods, using Twitter. So, once we're, find out more about Tim Joy. I'm a sucker for a condensed, exaggerated emotion. That's what made me fall for Rock and Roll in the first place. In Camden, Joyce, men of Festos were quite good pop songs. Each one short, crisp, and strange. Reading his bizarre claim that Paul Simon's Grace Land was the best album of the 1980s that a Mecon's cassette saved his life, that he, Campen Joy, should father McDonald's baby, that an obscure little group called Yola Tango art great  Chinese food. I felt  there was no one in the world who cared more about what the Tars and drums can do. One of my favorites dealt with the global economic impact of the indie band, Pavey. It goes  this. I hear by suggest that the American President and all them trade grabs Hall Pavement to the trade talks. They are our grandest export, our finest product, infusible and hot weather, our best materials. Payment should be carried on our shoulders and emblazoned on our backs and ushered onto waiting planes at the last minute with an almost a feat deliberate importance. Their belly is bloated with our very best needs. Have a pleasant look, sunshine. Charles Aaron, an editor at Spin, remember stumbling upon the pavement pieces and orange hand-bill on a telephone pole by its Brooklyn subway stop. It was the first time you saw one of Joyce posters that had lined his head to step piece. I couldn't imagine that it was really the bait about the bamboo paper. when I thought it was maybe about a PV company . Then I read it and it was this impassioned review of, I think, they're crooked right now. And also about how magnetic and sort of awe inspired Steve Marcus, the singer, works. And it wasn't that while written review, but it was so impassioned. And as it went to the end, it became more  a stalker, but I knew that at one point Steve Marcus lived in the neighborhood and I started to get worried that someone was stalking and they were right. And so I almost wanted to take it down. It was disturbing. It was funny though. It was possibly a joke. It seems less  a joke. It seems more disturbing than you. Probably a couple weeks later. I was coming back home from the laundry bag. And this time I was staring down at the ground. And it was another long and passionate review veering into stalker  comments about Lottango. And I mean these are not the most well known bands in the world and I just couldn't understand where these handvills possibly were coming from in it. I felt  I was one of maybe five to ten people in the zip code who would actually know who these bands were. It gets to the point where I thought. I felt  someone was planting them for me to find. And do  his real name? No, I don't. And people with these tell me. Because I guess because I've seen interest, if I was this interested, they would probably tell me right out, but they see their stuff. So I'm fascinated. So they want to keep the myth going. So. Cam and Joy are whoever you are. Can you tell me how long is the end Cam and Joy? , I've been Cam and Joy for about, , about four years. What, what's your real first name? My real first name is Tom. Tom, how do you tell me the truth? You tell me. Okay, sleep. Oh, did you do what the truth? He says he decided on the name Campbell who was visiting Trenton New Jersey. He says he went there looking for the darkest, most classic American city. But the locals had this bus. You should really go down to Campbell. Campbell New Jersey. Campbell New Jersey. And I said, why? I said, this is a lot. It's a lot  Trenton, but without all the frills. He claims that calling himself Campbell opened a window that he gave him permission to experiment with his writing. say whatever you want to be whoever you want. Does it Tom have a real job? Yes. What does Tom do? Well, right now, Tom works as a new professor. I feel  a potman is a bull. I know. So I Tom's job. Where does he process words? Tom? Oh, no. Well, I'm smarter. And do the world things while yours? They address Tom as Tom? Yes, they. And they know about community. They know Tom's dirty little secret. Thank you, Jim. If I went in here and I said, yeah, I'll take it off in conversation with . Can I tell you while I'm doing this with , a world important artist I am? , I mean, that wouldn't really, , you can do this. This song dressed differently, this song were in the clothes, it came in. It's , it can't be, obviously, must wear a cape. No, they sure, they sure a lot. They sure, toothbrushes and clones, they sleep on the same pillow. Now, let's say you're out of party. And you're introducing yourself to someone who do you say, I mean, he says. I can't go either to say I don't go. Shh. , I, I, I. Joy is such a trickster in so a custom to playing around with her so night in high circles, and by the end of the time I spent with them, I no longer trust in a word. said, his poster campaign while I was there certain right. One thing for a man to verbal stop the lead singer, a huge, something else to stop his ex-girl. It was ball and high-stead, and the poster's ran to the against the phone, claiming that his girlfriend broke up with him because he couldn't call her. He says he couldn't find a pay phone to work, and when he did he was out of change. We had a little debate någon relais auspicious. Beef my shirt. Saltiness. successive ses of the worst‌ Weil sliced Korean expensiveInverse TV theory that you you pay up all over town. He's sorry. Paranoid grants against phone company and that's what brings the women to your door. It's never, it's never proven policy out. It's, , you go into bars. I see guys doing this all the time. They go into bars and they explain, , the hands are freezing cold and they're suffering prospered by because they've been up all night posturing. So they're last girlfriend. time and again these are the guys that leave the bar a company pouch is by one but by many many women. So this woman is going to read the phrase what I was trying to use the paper but my hands slipped from pizza grease only showing the receiver and could not lift it from the cradle. But you think women could go I mean go I'm going to go it whose hands are slipped from pizza grease that that's the voice they want. This last girlfriend of mine pizza grease was sort of a catch-off thing that we would I don't want to get too specific, but I would say that he's agrees, and it's certainly a lubricant for the heart. I think in the heart, I think, yeah, what I'm saying here is that I'm a man. , I'm a man, and I have an appetite. Later, when I tell Joy that his stalker imposes towards his ex-girlfriend making nervous, tells me that the whole thing, even the weirdest poster-top-handling conspiracy hearts, was just a big, put on an art-prot, and that he and the woman parted English. Then, when I asked if I could corroborate this part, it says that there was no single one, just a composite of several. Here I was, trying to Joy's raggy, because I thought it was so... emotional raw so embarrassing when honest when really it's a web of pictures This was interesting and the glass party, but it gets even more There's another well know there's another name that I'm writing under my Now wait a minute What did this person write what is Is he right is he a journalist the other guy third man the third man?

I'm not a simple one. What rhymes with Elvis? No, this is beautiful. I'm purple. For the other day you told me you were out of paper and you were picking up on some girl. What name did you give her? Emily. We should call now that I wasn't successful in any way. I mean, and it could be that Tom could have been on farm horse in that way. And Tom should have gone back in the grass again. It wasn't just that, , I didn't think that was going to be coming from the farm. But that... Tom's right out the third guy, Tom. One pound weight. some of the difference between Camden and Tom is examining their attitudes about pre-gence. Camden devoted his coolest manifesto to the conqueror, spewing, I would crawl through glass, claw your eyes, I would offer a hug if my suit weren't splomps. So I think Tom would hear Fiddie Johnson playing a commuse act, the story  bed death, not with sort of... This sort of thing, this sort of occurrence, which is, it should be to show these cute things. And it used to seem good. Don't know what happened to him.
