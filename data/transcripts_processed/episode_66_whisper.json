  "text": "From PI, Public Radio International. From PI, Public Radio Public Radio. Public Radio International. In the BB-Easy-Scargetz-Smart-Life-Mine class, a few weeks ago we invited you, sent us your stories, life, internet, send us your rewards, or our new, new new new exchanges, interesting things down and use networks and web pages, hundreds of people who started. I've a cool deal. interviews with some of them, and if I did the one-two-day parent's Hago to Shkagur's Museum of Temporary Art, for a show, they on our program. What happened? When all the tapes and readings and people were gathered on stage, the museum's theme. Sumeria's 19-year-old, an English major at the University of Washington, and one day she's cruising in it, visiting the home pages of the beats and jurs. And I came across this site with a phone. was amazing. It was the most cutting edge, spot-pivoking sight I had ever seen. And so I was examining it, checking it out, and I realized this guy was my age, and he worked at my first office, and that just blew me away. Some student, I really were talking in the morning, and here this guy worked at my first office. I, I am an emailing, just to tell him how much I would recite for him to be. was and he wrote back and that went on for about four or five days just to write him down and go on really personal stuff. She's not just computer geeks up. What is the greatest reward of the internet? How would I argue that one main difference can redow a life in the net? Is it you can need a stranger in getting a new to me? Much faster than in class. But for a week, Mary and this guy wrote each other several times a day. Well, personal emails. Then they agreed to meet in person. In coffee shop. On Valentine's Day. I was nervous before we met. So I was worried that he wouldn't find these interesting in real life. So we met for coffee. We met standing next to 12 hours together. There wasn't really turning point. until today's later, we had continued to see each other. And one night we ended up going out to the office, and  you saw it's better night, nobody's there. And we were hanging out and looking you've never been in all of a sudden we were making up. And it was crazy. And you were good. You were , oh yeah. Yeah. What's the bad? But it was awkward because it was my first hearing. I never knew we'd done that. There's a very fascinating one. I'm a sexy person. Right. Oh, no. It was my first time. This teasing everybody at all. Yeah. Because you had never had a high school boyfriend. No. Now I was a real big brother. Nice school. I think that's the only thing that I can do. So as you present, just make me know something in this moment. Yeah. And so, made it all the more surreal, I think. It was just weird to me to think that, you subscribe, I met a little bit of a week ago, by chance on the internet. And here we are at his office, to make this. And then after that, I... Barely He told me that he did one relationship now that he wanted great keep using the term He wanted me for a certain million boy had her This was no yes He was a very good boy All the hype about the revolutionary changes the internet is going to bring us what's striking about this particular story He's how much of it could have happened that to start off. Holocaust America. Can H Boys kiss you on data too. And freak out. And we'll drop. All consider as a snare of mystery and intimacy. And some exotic stage props from the drama. Otherwise the lines and the mrs are very very old. After the night and the office and the time to stop, I noticed. Boy, he really was steeped in some lines there. Yeah, I'm going to call you. He actually was going to set me up with a copy of Office 97. He never did. Oh, the... Yeah! A work point in the whole direction did he come to the Office 97. Actually the first night he met, , did you just say, he's giving me all the seats? No, I thought it was cool. I heard some things about it. I don't know what to do. Ah, I thought it was cool. Now I'm drinking mangoed bathroom in a pet bowl night and some some young man is probably in the streets of Seattle Welcome to the view district telling women got your free software Well the question we personally saw is what is happening on And other things happening in the middle of the Over the past few weeks you have a person sitting around providing radio listeners to send us samples around emails, samples of things that found on the net that they thought were especially interesting and amusing. We have advertised here in Chicago as people to come here today to be museum contemporary art with those samples. Living the next hour with your people here and people around the country and I'm in science to be sampling of what's going on on the net. you my purpose Today's show is David Halbsheim, welcome, David. David is a playwright of novelist. His play, trans, when the French first awarded the Edinburgh Theatre Festival, was produced for the Brighton Arch Festival, his play, the persecution of Arnold Pech, who made this year at Redwell and Theatre, to the Chicago and years ago. David started having the show as we called Redwell shows, when people on stage to bring their mail to a theatre and read it. Just a big open-minded, adapting. quantitative shows to the electronic media today. David, why didn't you explain the rules how many shows . Okay, this is a show with many many rules. That's why we have two host certain iridesnaf of 1980. The first rule is the time rule. These are eight times. These are mechanical devices that do not exist inside. They are crude. They will get approximately four minutes. That's what everybody will have in their presenting. Let's give a sample thanks. Military spec. But these have different things, but we're going to start with this one here. This is your basic. So when you hear that, you must stop mid-solabone. Exit the scene. You see much less. You must start talking to me. So we're going to begin with Joe Fasco. In preparation for this show, we spend many hours surfing the net together and finding file. We go away into seeing those going to come up and we need some. Wait a minute, Joe, let me get this timer going here. I'll get a 50-70-50, 50-70, 50 places. This one is a website of this guy who is building a new law of all of these foil in the right way to speak about this problem. This is, don't you remember exactly how Bob Gain was inspired, because apparently a new foil of various varieties, it is most in candy wrappers, the few bits of foil, réseатов in the fridge? So far, the best finish coat is York peppermint hair irreversence. Other foil is fine, but a coat of peppermint hair irreversence is necessary to keep it on. Gummarapers also tend to have that quality. They are far too difficult to peel, considering minimal bulk to hair. Gummarapers do make a good finish coat on top of peppermint hair irreversence. So, some items such as persimmonitures, it's look  they might be good-tint, or your iron. The ball is more impressive in person, this page can hope to protect. This picture. And then he has this diary of his growth. He starts back in January. He says, we've gotten an electric postage scale in the office. He's one more digit of precision. So we now have a way to 3.9 hours. I have done the math to compute the density of ball. Drupal is much lower than that of solid aluminum. I have a hard time believing the ball is less than half blue than the ball. So I invite you to let me know if there are any errors in my competition. I expect that dancing would be less than they had a solid mood. Just a small amount of error between theirs, the foil, the adhesive coating, in small quantities of chalk, these and other leftovers. From the fun of food items that the rapper grew originally used to payact. I wouldn't have been too surprised by 5 or even 10% of it. But I find the actual results obtained a little bit of a relief. I have a question for you. , you believe that fellow would have been would be making that ball for one for the internet. And so, I think that one of the discussions we've been having to pass from Alexis is the internet to eat and eat them. And I think that it is in the sense that people now know they have potentially millions of readers, readers, and whereas the poor, , guy would make a silver ball. He'd make a silver ball, but he's guess no, I know that. No, but he's guess no. And some of you who are interested in the family is a beast, other sites that I'm making new and for a while. And someone also who's making a rubber band ball. But I think actually the idea that he might get some notoriety at it's ball has spurred him earned to prefer the at least maybe it would have been a media, a media broker ball. I think he's working there to make the opening thing. All right, that's , thank you, Joe. Alright, next weed it ... You can just start, I'll tell us anything you can do now. I'll just go to the time of the form of this. Before my friend of mine was called, this crime she living with her has been in son in England. Every three weeks or so, she sends out when I call, I broadcast email. She sends it to what has now become 56 email addresses. I'm going to read one of the broadcast emails but before I do I think she was two meals. One is that she refers to her husband as Bobo or Bobo. And she refers to her son as Boot because she leaned him after been read and she was not good. That's the same as the same. The granted that is his name. So she also writes her attention. with pause, fair pause. In for example, once after visiting the staff for it on the line, she said, three pause for Shakespeareville. So here's the first one that I ever received. Hi, baby boo at first day in London, see that. We went to the British and see. Quick stop to her. Really, quick stops to dig then in what's Westminster Aggie. to take pictures. We bought a six-foot diameter beach towel that I lay out for boot play on. I told him that it's his boundary and he can cause a lot of it. Now get left. The wires. ,  this dog tree. Well, he does a good job. You can see me on my feet now. Before I have to watch, I'm just gonna watch it. What is this ? It's  one of those Christmas... letters. How often did she say? But this comes, I mean, I've recently, I think I've received this over the last year and it's coming from the house and month and for you, some big news are. Actually, what's really interesting is that she and I have grown apart and I didn't really quite know how to end relationship. Right. But these emails that actually didn't be some closure. I don't know if I almost agreed, but this is Because now you never have to say anything. I don't say anything. I mean, it's just, oh. Keep up with the fish and fat. And I never have to say anything. I don't, I never respond to that. But she continues to sound them to me. And I have a lot of fun being them. But, and before I used to go really guilty, I never respond to the water as much as I can. They're fine. But now I think they're fine. This is fine. I don't want to be. Once a month becomes due in Malaysia. And then I just read it and I actually read it. I'm not going to be more about this. That actually is about to remind everyone. See all stops. I can't. I can't. I borrowed it to two other friends who are sitting up here and they read it and come back to me. I can't. Well, she doesn't listen to the baby. Oh, I can't. We thought my friends might set on about it. We thought why don't we? She's a little bit wrong. Thank you. Thank you. What is there to ride? What is there to say? Same things I've learned every day. Not a thing. need to ride, not a thing to say. So I take my pen and hand and start the same whole world. So for the next time that we do, I want to go contact this, we have test run country. for things going on on the net. And some of you noticed about this one web page, who are searching for people who were having experiences on net that they would never have otherwise. And this particular page was made by a woman Jenny Rangham, a senior at Dickinson College in Spain. And a lot of people she created her own little home page on the work on web. There's the regular part of my page, I just would say, with information about movies, I  things  that,  everybody has on that page. The one items that... has become extremely popular though, is the Jenny Cam. And it's just a camera that sits in my room and takes a picture every three minutes and uploads it. So every three minutes you can find out what fascinating thing I'm doing more. The Jenny Cam is on seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and the number of people who want to see what fascinating things going on in a college girls, warm room each day. People I'm not sure, but as far as the number of hits go, get over 500,000. I have millions hits every single day. And what if we will see? Nothing. Really? I write email. I have friends over. I can watch my head talk when I'm not in the room. Things  that. Pretty much just regular college life as far as I know. I associate producer tuned into your page. Just depends on what's going on. And then, for about a half an hour, she witnessed you on. them every few minutes to be another picture of you in a different position on the telecom. I talk on the phone a lot. In a way it's hard to think of anything more than all than seeing a college student's dorm. I would have to agree. I would absolutely agree. I don't do anything that's that interesting. I don't have company very often. I don't do anything more interesting. I believe in talking from watch to be sleep. Well, I'm just going to talk about the new to me. Well, whenever I'm new to my room, I'm new to the Jenny Cam. But , when I think about how often somebody is newed in the course of the day, it's really not very long. Well, maybe I'm not an average person, but I figure when I'm alone, who really cares. I sleep naked and I get changed. When I get out of the shower, I'm all right. There's no hurry to come close. I'm just going to sleep naked. I don't think about it much. So whenever I'm normal, we can remember that's what I would be on the camera. It really doesn't affect you much in a big way. But wait, you're the same thing, make it for the future. I have to know you people that... It means I think you. I think the camera would be a lot less interesting if I pay that much attention to it would be more of a stage show. I mean, people would feel of the camera. that it is. Whatever is normally going on in my room and with it having been up for a year and a half now, I'm pretty accustomed to it. It doesn't affect much of this. It's been any moments of the last few years we were, we were sorry that Camo was in the front room. Actually, it goes sort of the opposite way. Whenever I go home from breaks or spring break, I thought something  that. I'm always sad to be away from the hammers. It's really a different feeling. Whenever I'm in the room and the camera is broken up for some reason. It feels, my room feels totally different, it's  I'm completely alone. So I, I really prefer the camera beatin' and I sat on the top, I was supposed to be pushing one thing. Because you don't feel alone when it's on. Right, even though there's nobody actually there with me, even though I'm still alone, it's... Even if there's nobody watching camera from the other end, it's just comforting to know that there is somebody that is hardly out there. And you'd be why I wear some of the people's things. A lot of people, it's totally hoping to find me. I'm sure I'm gonna get this for dad, things  that. It's hoping to find me. But I get lots of enough people to say that it's just nice when they're alone in their office. To know that there's somebody else out there, something else they'll say. Is doing nothing more interesting than what they're doing at the same time. It's  having a little virtual thing. Now it's on point in the two years you probably had somebody over. Right on. So to mess around. Sure. And... At that point it goes on the other person's comfort ability. I have no problem. That's the whole point in the channel that it's whatever I'm doing. But when I went into this, I understood in order to make really work. We have to be no matter what I was doing. But I can't really enforce that on people who are doing so. If the other person is uncomfortable, then the camera is turned off or it points to a different part. And general has the ability to speak in a company? Yes. Yes. Was there ever time the action had somebody over the way? She said we can all be serving? Yes, in fact. And the fun thing is that it never actually was broadcast because the number of people suddenly reloading on the server and did that crashing computer that posted the check. Wow. So even though we were there in the camera was on, the server was crashed by the number of people wanting to see. Once you're impression of who these people are, you shut your konuşms off. Doing that neat thing you can do. Oh, I don't know. Mostly men. It's almost exclusively men. I do I get about 700 miles a day and of that number maybe 10 or from You get 700 miles a day. Right. What are people saying? Well a lot of those are entries to a contest on my webpage called Neenek serve. Where once a week I put up a new picture of some flows up shot of part of my bot. I don't know what to do. So I would say 300 or so that number are the network members. The rest of them are people saying either I saw your web hand or a page or can I call you? Can you send me special pictures? It's really really random, just. I don't know what you guys are. I don't know what you guys are. Jenny says she's been spying to six hours a day answering me. And when you talk about her on the one hand, there seem to be something completely innocent in what she is doing. Putting yourself out there and not really caring who sees. And if you're pressur about her own exhibitionism, she'll tell you, over and over, oh no, no, no, no, it's not about exhibitionism. It's inspiring. I let people view a person's entire life. That it. The one thing that she's gotten on the internet that she can never have gotten so easily any other way is she's famous. Within , a small. circle to small and take your kind of thing. I do get a fair number at this point in the process for autographed pictures and people wanting to buy my hair, my clothes and things and stuff. Why? Please, Gary. Well, once I was taught in camera action, turning my bangs because it don't students. Cheap. And all of a sudden, I got four emails and people's. Are you going to do anything with that hair? Can I buy it from you? And what's you make? Well, , it's kind of scary. I mean, I do meet people from time to time. Somebody will say I'm passing through the area Can think I can meet you? Yeah, you said. , if I actually have a pretty good nap for knowing, sure, can you feel about people right off the bat? So sometimes I see them in the same class, yes, I've had dinner with both probably a dozen people. And is that the lunch? , I had one person in the lunch. Had a hard time taking no for an answer in the afternoon. One that we fear I wasn't interested in. Really, let's cut a piece. It is kind of, I kind of, , fair number of improper passes in the evening. But, it stays at a pass. They were a cable child. They would just have a hammer on in there. But no, sir. When he brought us down, do you think he'd get a half million views? I don't think I would because if you have a TV, you have a thing you can watch. I think it would still be popular, but I think that that would be a lot less interesting because people can do this from their office at work and say, have internet musicians, not modernists, more people can just put it on and leave it on in the background while you're doing whatever else I'm getting. Hi. Hi. Jenny Mingle is described with the college she's moved to another city, which has gotten job design and web pages for a big national magazine. Coming up by the Palson the net, it's in the mini. life by glass on sweet summer program which is a theme, your variety of different kinds of stories on that theme, the sweet beer, trying something different. We're broadcasting through museum, contemporary art here in Chicago, but we're taking what challenges might call a core sample of things happening on the internet, bring unsigned to the sample. How are people using the net? What is happening on the net that is not happening in the world? It also has not happened in the world. Over the last few weeks we have advertised asking people to come here today with things they have found on the net and putting their own net. of our changes from round the country or joining by telephone by closed today is play way to David Halbstein just to make a difference in dance and pass in the stage during Chicago. Back to you, then. Thank you. But now this example of people's lives changed by the internet. I mean in Fred Keeper with that side call on the Sophia there are septage neurons with seven kids and fifteen. Okay well we first got our email going on our computer. Hey Santa Mathews 2, our son-in-law. I'm gonna talk to the press with KIEFF. You  the, it was my first time to use it in the left 20F song. The email was chatty email, but everything going on in the memory. Sorry, love. So I got back a letter from the one to stress with KIEFF, could you say? I enjoyed this bladder, but I don't think he meant it's clean. And then I, I was back, it says thanks to the police, the police, the police, the kids, you were back and we've been writing now for two years. Man, couple of us, got to hear you now, keep drinking. for the Lord, and he works at Tandy and does the radio show out there, and when he got Mrs. Keeper's email in his account, the thing that actually got to him is that she signed it, love, mom, his own mother would just die to us or his father's dead years. This is Keeper's that you never intended or wanted. Have a long term, now friendship. It's  we had nothing's calm, the age that grew in the head shared with him. One is... cafe,  it wasn't a lot that we... we didn't have any trouble. At first we were writing  the day we both started saving us. And now we're using a patch, these ones we've been in in Oregon, good room for Frank and Brazil, this is just a little less болa toast. a beautiful time. And  30 years younger than you. I've reached the top of the day. I recall my regular job in Shepley. In December when I started operation, he found every night  her. The rest of the season. I've really done my work. So what in the world was in this risk of health and symptoms? People possibly said, we had a bond with that. Oh, I did. I just remembered indicating that I was accepting. We were, we had a speaking match. And then, , you could be the story. That's happy. doing weird things with these funny things. Right. You never had that much. You never had that much. You never had that much. You never had that much. You never had that much. And all of that kind of stuff, one. And the one that I can, you hear from cup of tea. One by daughter who hears from almost the other. Did you have as much contact with him, of course? Oh, now. How do we do it now? I always, I are new and never really were part of that life and we can do that. And last thing, where are we? We're out to close. We're in the future. So , so we brought you all course. Oh, it's just one, I'm sure, so space, I guess they tell you that. Please, please don't lie. Thank you. Checking the universe thing, money. See you, it's on. Bye. Oh, keep it. Yep. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay, let's go with all readers. Our next album. Steve 7. Steve 7. I came across a user net group called Alt. I'm not a user net expert. This is a short time on. I was just talking to someone and they started thinking about a couple of things. Here's an interesting thought. One girl was  five, five, two, ten, five. She wasn't a great athlete, she had a lot of muscles. She was a good man, right? She was  five. So with that thought in mind, I'm curious to know, assuming you can lead that thing. be back right so our easiest way to lift the house, which they are, how much weight will you get some fitness body to lift me? I mean if they can lift 200 pound guys over their shoulders and press them overhead just imagine how much they could lift piggyback any thoughts? So the response that's ee yeah here's the thought where are the lift that 200 pound man overhead press boy would I ever  to see that. I mean who cares about piggyback rides? A piggyback ride isn't unlipped at all. Manches climbs on and all the weight is supported by the bones of the legs because the legs are already bombed out. Not impressive, not six. But, see a woman militarily pressed, now that's worth paying to see. My greatest thrill to see at all. There. In possible you say, maybe, but consider this. In 1988, when we went with YouTube, Tom made it by young age girls. I saw six-year-old Chinese girls and one of the 65 pounds, as though it were better. She cleaned it directly, 231 pounds, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand. Thanks. She made one. Try this guys. Go to your garage, load up that old for about six, 27 pounds. I'll take that same for a bell and lift it all the way over ahead about five seconds. So these are the spots that yes. Now we're getting closer. Our next video. The worst. The worst. The worst. I met the sky last fall and we worked most week in another country. So our romance was in that true man. And pastless ways. And I don't know if I can have a spirit but just start going out with writing it over now. It's very exciting. I think that's the sound I've never heard of. So anyway, we went out with that beautiful once. and then to be done. But eventually, in a certain debate, you start to have thoughts on our daily correspondence that you want to see. And finally, I, I love this moment, and good. Dear, I understand. I feel  I'm making so much to you. I think you should not please in the case. One day. for you every day. You should taste the turkey on the meat. So this is your very heartfelt and difficult to write that out about two and a week. And this is a dramatic culture class. And so when we finally did talk, it was  that. There were 36 hours of intense meltdown. And I fired up by Mr. Maltteri and we broke up. And while we were breaking up, my computer crashed. Lost all. And so I lost all of these perspectives from the pages. And I worked on. I told you about this. You can sign me on two questions. This is my online. Well, at that time, , I didn't want to read the text. I just wanted to know. So when I prepared this show tonight, I decided to go back and do it too. And I just, I was just, I was just, I did. And part of my health, I was in health, so this is what you want me to do. So, it's really so good of course. I'm very glad to be here. I'll take some time. Thanks for watching. Well... I inform this... I accept myself to do my life in some kind of community who walks on these thoughts over time. I still can't quite somewhere else. We'll see you in the next video. Yeah. This is the question. This is the question that every man I tell the story to. Ah! Ah! Ah! Asme! It didn't occur to me. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! And he would have had to bounce and pluck the trouble. Did you? Has it been quoted? Oh! Oh! Oh! What's he? Ah! Nice. Ah! Ok! Just go. Ah! AF! Yeah! I, right now, I'm from G What are you doing here? Oh, you see. Oh, you see. That's the song. Oh, you see. Spong, Gun Alrightin malfunction Siourec C- Oh the St啦 동 You thought. inquiry questions, it here has every freshman and little spy odata and he liked me but not of our country each other so we and what he ended up doing was obsessive about my photo and deciding well I can't just obsessive about her photo I  to know more about her person so sent out  broadcast message to everybody dormant that was on the net of the time asking what I was so all these strangers responded and they just made stuff up. But it was actually very positive because what happened was that handed up writing the letter on paper. I was in quotes about all the things people had said about me that I was cheerful and she told me to have a good position. He decided I was a very confident person. I was kind of cornered in falling in by my friends. This story that my family used to leave, got someone I want. And I had with... Do you think that on the way that you said you put some music to fall for that money? Yeah, I have to admit that, first thing he said when I called him up, he was really nervous and I had to be fair. He said, oh, yeah, we can get together, but not quite a night because, right in the next P-Pomp Terminal. , so a day to teach. For those who you, and for those who you, and for those who you, they solve. website, you have to think, I built a website for you have two people. So yeah, idiotic you want it, you got, put an end to companies in percent of a mirror. They're not meeting credit better than in modern world. Tom Schee, Supreme Court Justice, 100% problem in charge of your office. I must admit for better first known business. But the emphasis is humor. In early November last year, humor versus what? attacks and people without doubt. And if you all be the other thing that you would do your prosthletize, I'm gonna try to bring people over it, encourage people to create gaps in their teeth. Absolutely. What would any of the dogs? This is very, this is not a lot of new students. In early November, the next year was watching Bears pass. During the previous year, the last post-weeks, until that week's end, to this entry. Start new ones, leaving the distance opposite. who is on a stamp writing high top team. I'm just telling you, but something was missing, Coach Lambo's favorite song. He had a new song. The next day is a joke and he's new about two songs, which I think we have, Coach Lambo's favorite song. Because medically altered who would done King G if he were bald, or Gorbachev without the cool age game, or Jimmy Granny without that nose. So knowing that this was one small effort and a little fun pop! I'm going to explain more stories about it's no real name. I expected little to know attention. Event in Yahoo, which is today speaking to Washington Post, which is an app based on the language or an app called, Chicago's Channel 17 to my program, the story is a new, super, , getting out of hand. Yeah, time out. If you're thinking about this, I'm going to put a picture on the screen. I'm really excited. I'm saying running buttons. And he did, he refused to, freeze Maryland, A super fan ready to scrap myself bombs, echo up my teeth, And Washington to see if they didnt change beta, and it was all pretty much YouTube Pirates , So Bob, the other super fast capability To be instant, he ran excited, runs excited, andinmyi whips say for catty people and taken they seriously so I call them Bob and we are talking about he is the customer and s laughs but she is a goodly nice Sting, That was it. Let's go get some of these web. This is called C.B. It's real. It's called E. It's called C. It's called C. It's called R. It's called C.B. It's called C.B. It's called C.B. It's called C.B. music First, we look prettier, as screws in the net. and show a specialty means you can't be dead We found Earl Jackson, this is a very good machine for me, this is a lot, it's a great weapon, it's a set in websites, it's a same. Because this story, we can get into one of your own, I was there well in other services and services for a lot, and there are these chat rooms where I'm given to meet and talk. And in San Francisco, it's fairly wild. There's a 24 hour bulletin bomb that I was serving for. story of the story, where because we can't see that he would attempt to score and he had a problem, he could have sex anytime in the day or night. This was very cold, right? I was in court. Right, he did me the sex. Right, can  exactly what they wanted to do? And you probably have new vision. But I asked of the spirit you could see in this story of AOL, that there was a new metaphysics of sexuality, because he would track up cyber sex or real sex. and actually pretty happy with something enough, but real sex in that farm sex. Oh, really? Yeah, so it became the instead of a 22 year old student, so it's a 32 year student. And we have real sex, auto-reem sex, and cyber sex. Wait, ultra-reel sex, you say? There we make what I call a slow timing for this, which means actually physical hunger. How do you say it? left tried to make his new and not But he needs such a different and I'm understood A lot of little family such struggles and it's perfect and so, he says to no, at that point something we could say because it's a misunderstanding We must always Back in December 2003, O Jackson, Nettoli, and one of these gay chabbers. The last name is Ken, with nearby, pretty at the book, so to many of you. But almost every day for a year, they got online to get a new deal of these elaborate fantasies on them. These are not kind of sufferware on them. You can see that the other person types as they can get a new one. You can see that in the future, but have a fantasy about breaking people. my class and then I turned back and went off. But it was really sort of a game, but these narratives became so intense and that we would set times in day and for who just checking these and do you have time for a story now and hit started and then I can do it. And we have all of these stories. But as we get leaners, then little parts of life are coming and then it will be a story that takes some routes. Then I know a little bit more and soon the set part was really in the space to tell the other stories. And sometimes you're telling the story about his childhood and his very, and then remind him of second fantasy. And then he put me in, and you can plan to do these things. We can sort of  jazz, he and his story is on. We have a dress. The Monday he was asking me if I had time. to talk to and it's just leaving but in the way he is typing in the difference. You can tell even the way he was typing was different? Yes, yes. What do you mean? People have become happy and there's speed or way to respond or didn't put a smiling face, but if there's a number of words, I just knew there was something really wrong the way he asked me and I'm tired. Maybe he's going to help and help a villain? And he said I Had New Son. No. And I think I knew it instantly, what that was. It just happened. And you're not in a break. And our messages to each other then became a lot more about that, you're about what happened from the child and all the things that were in the childhood, for a tragedy. And you may see between the child and your neighborhood because it's really the responsibility of these things. Then this one, I should have gotten more nervous. Okay. He started saying that he wanted me to support you for a long time because he associated with foreign women becoming a bit mean. So he wanted to be out into me and he helped me a person. I really wanted to do this for me. So there's suddenly lots of foreigners in the house and then following me and I was on the TV and just before I got ready to stamp this off. I got a message from my husband who's well in the newspapers. Now, here, this range, you can almost entirely tap all that in this case, which is standing and you can arrive at this lesson. I have it all box up now. Go give it to my friend. He will mail it for me, and I can do it before. And it will arrive at the Thursday or Friday here today express. I hope that it comes to help explain things. Thanks for being friends and really moving. And then three day nothing and one wine appeared to interacted with the Shireps and one of the nine people who came and then when their surgery came danced and we fetched what can if you are screaming? Well dinner community, it would be great if they are having a fun. in a I'd  to ask them to write, , and to look at his online handwriting to the audience. This premiered against him in his ashes will be dropped into the ocean of synthesis. Hence mental altitude of the last 46 weeks, it's very hard to describe. This vastness is the least, but it will keep the count open for the next day if you have any questions in his post-loss. We will try to use him for you. He's friend being. Did he send you a final note in the last pages? Yeah, it was the only time I ever saw it's never written. That said, it's similar because it's thank you to the friend who needed it. I would always say, You must have been so strange to see a physical manifestation of this. It was really odd, was that when you first sent the first box of tapes. tell me which tape had seen where two people are once the image and asked to do. Now that doesn't mean that people  everyone of them, but he knew the fences in order to resume the last. So even at that point, our fences were constantly mediated by some other technology. And which is quite heartbreaking, ? But none of this was called. There was something so tender about this. And I was very moved by. Bye. experience. After you died, you could get to a period of control. Yes, it is. What is strange thing to be more in somebody you never actually saw? Yeah, although it's real. When people say all the computers are making us all isolated and it's such a cold I could enjoy the motion experience. the launching friendships that would be near the last month. It's funny because , it's almost, it's almost  the whole thing. It could be a kind of elaborate, , that he would be such a creep that I, I, I thought of that actually, because it seemed almost. No drama from the bottom. Yeah. No, it's really tough. I wrote a story, I wrote an end, I wrote an end, I wrote an end. After he died,  how every person was supposed to be gone. How many people back to the places were used to go with that? , you think that, never to be. In this sense, after he was gone, he knew he could back on the Buddha. He'd used senses, lots. Yes, he really got gone when I saw some of the else. matrices and specificשרis.' DNA, and the DNA in it. So it's the main background with which it's polyman科ism, person by further decades.
