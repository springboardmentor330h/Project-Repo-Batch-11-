Keep it Sea Siky, naturally causing up with the woman his mother hates most in the world. I only surprise about that part of the story as they're not all Jews. Keep it Mary's Siky. But he doesn't want Siky to know that he's a god. It's a little ruined. She won't love him for who he is in this heart. She'll just love him for these famous, powerful. So he makes her promise to never look at him. They have this passionate love that takes place entirely in the dark. But her girlfriend's popular time to start. They tell her that if he never wants her to see him, it must be because he has something behind. It must be a monster. So she comes to her midnight while he's sleeping with a good candlelight. And she sees him there. He's naked, he's perfect, he has wings. He's beautiful. And she's just about to go when some wax one of the candles falls on him, any wigs with a star. And they're eyes made. He sees that she's betrayed him. She broke a promise. She got it his love, she wanted to see. And the God's Punisher, this, I say to you, somebody who works in the medium. radio where you never see anything. This is what seeing is all about. Right there, we do not listen to our hearts, we doubt, and then we want to love. And seeing is about something else. It's about power. I check with an actual humanities professor, this is really told me Richard Kine teaches at Cornwall. Power to dominate and even destroy it. It's a very obstory in history. and may have biological origins. When a dog from the weeks directly in the hive and other animals are huge, as if to stare at down, that's a certain sign of hostile feelings, sort of challenge of privilege or rushing. It's an ancient rule he says, that's why slaves don't look in the eyes of their masters. That's why you don't meet the eyes of a king, why you balance presence. It's why parts of British royalty even today. For not to be seen in public, not to be photographed. Even after Prince's day-on, it became the most photographed woman in the world. And I mean, the monarchy itself, I mean, particularly has long sort of felt and is in the contrary, more from the hope of it to the monarchy. And perhaps even the necessary to survive, that it appears less in public. That's one reason why they were so belonged by Diana. In the mentioning mentioned song. Friends, I believe. Powerful. that leaders should be little seen and rarely, rarely heard. That the power sort of comes from the invisibility. I've been thinking a lot lately about why somebody would pay 30 bucks to come to a theater and see a show that you can get for free on the radio. And I think that this is the very reason, right here, on the radio, invisible. We are just too powerful. Seeing anybody that you hear on the radio it makes them human songs. Which seems  a... Well, from WBE's issue, public radio international. It's American life. I'm Ira Glass. Today bringing you a co-production with WNYC in New York, a live show from town hall in New York City. ADO Today on our program, as hundreds of people watch us do the show our theme is, what are you looking at? Stories of what it means to be seen and to see, at one American guy, the story of one woman's ongoing quest to look meaner. Back to life savers. The story of a teenage girl who would hit you if you looked at her the wrong way. And what happened when suddenly hundreds of people were looking at her. All at once. Act 3. Time every mountain. Die hard to your great-a-drake off heads off to a land of incomprehensible people. Who he worries are always noticing how different he is. A land called New Hampshire. On stage, us a year of town hall, they might be giants and the American life orchestra. Stay with us. At one, American ball. There are the people who take hours to get dressed. You dress primarily to be seen. And then there are the rest of us. Sometimes someone tries to make jump on that second group into the first group. Please welcome, writer Sarah Down. I'm sitting at my desk quietly minding my own as they say in the rat songs. When my torture darkens the doorway. She drags me into a cramped bathroom, shoves my head under a faucet, shines a blinding light in my eyes, cinches my neck and plastic sheeting and comes at me with scissors. She douses me with chemicals and makes me sit there, dehydrating under the plastic while the acid steams my flesh. And so, when I look up from my desk and see your standing there with the scissors, I shudder. Hi Mom, I'm safe. Guess you think I need a haircut? My mother had been a hairdresser before my twin sister Amy and I were born. More precisely. She was a hairdresser in Oklahoma in the 1960s, the B. Hives Gold in Age. Since she gave up her career to take care of us, all that energy that used to go into whipping hundreds of heads into an architectural frenzy was focused on the two of us. And since we were as bald as fairows, she killed time while our hair was growing in by Scotch taping bows to our newborn nogans. Her ardour for our parents increased as we got old. and her attentions never stopped at the neck. There were clothes, there were shoes, accessories. Amy liked to think about such things, shot, such things. Unlike me, my sister did not threaten to call amnesty international every time mom wanted to give her a home perm. I was a bit of an embarrassment to my mother, all scuffed shoes and stringing hair and lint. Once when Amy and I were 14. The three of us were getting out of the car after a trip to the mall. The neighbor woman who was outwatering her yard saw the shopping bags and asked what we bought. Amy showed off her new candy colored sweater in her hoos earrings and hot pink pants. The woman congratulated Amy. She then turned to me, pointing at the rectangular bulge for treating from the small brown bag in my hand. I reluctantly pulled out my single purchase. A hardback of the butter milk. My mother looked at the neighbor, rolled her eyes in my direction and staged whispered where going through a book phase. And it's such a hopeful, almost utopian word that word phase. And now that we are finishing up the third decade of the book phase, we ask ourselves if we have changed. Sure, we still dress in the bruise palette of gray, black and blue. And we still haven't gotten around a pair. our ears, but we were ellipsed it now. We own high-field shoes. Concessions have been made. Still, I have been called a crumudgeon by bitch magazine. I'm not the amin' time cultivating. Metry, feet old. I'm not as dower looking as I would . I'm stuck with this round, swede-py-face, tiny heart-shaped lips, the dainty-is-dimples, an apple cheek, so rosy I exist in a perpetual blush. At five foot core, I barely squeak by average height, and then there's my voice. It's great out of second grade. I come across so young and innocent and harmless that I have been guarded for buying maple syrup. Chorus feel more than safe approaching me for directions. Tell a marketer is always asked if my mother is home, and waitress is always always call me her. So the last time I got my hair. Cut, I asked my hairdresser if he could make me look more menacing. I said I admire Marilyn Manson's new hairdo and putting make me look  that. And even though my hairdresser is German and everything, when he was done with me, I have never in my life, but so sick and equally nice. Is it too much to ask to make strangers nervous, to look shady and untrustworthy and mal-content? Something needed to be done. I happen to hear about a group of gods in San Francisco who offer god-makeovers to civilians and then take them to a god club to see if they can pass. God's for those unfamiliar with this particular sub-culture are the pale-faced, black-clad vampiric types with four-lawn stairs framed by Raccoon I make up. The name derives, of course, from Gothic, a style according to my dictionary. emphasizing the grotesque mysterious and desolate. So I called Mary Mitchell a.k.a. Mary Queen of Hertz and asked for a private lesson in God. She just told me to come to San Francisco and pack some black clothes and she and her team of expert gods with handle the rest. Coming up with black apparel for the occasion wasn't particularly problematic for me. One might describe my closet as Johnny Cash, what's described. It is. It's dark in there. And I'm always admired the goss. There's something brave about them. Something romantic and feminine and free. Not to mention, refreshingly honest. If the funny t-shirt slogans and crisp khaki pants of the average American tell the lie that everything's going to be okay. The black lace scarves and goulish capes of goss tell the truth that you suffer. Then you die. The gods literally wear their hearts on their tattered sleeves, frankly, daring the world to stare at their inner ugliness and stare hard. I reported to a market street address where I met the five members of my death-formed over Beauty Squad. I met Indra, a gorgeous blonde and a long velvet skirt, parents, dashing and enveloped smoking jacket. The tall dark monique, Elizabeth and Strapie Black leather, and of course, Mary, whose seven-inch patent leather heels would relegate. her later on to dancing only to the slowest songs, for fear of tipping over. Prior to meeting Mary Queen of Hurtz, I found her sadistic nickname entirely appropriate as she assigned me, got homework to do before my arrival. The assignment consisted of going through a punchy little primer she wrote with Injra and Terence, which outlines the seven steps to got the tune. And number six asked me to go through my records and pull out the tune. darkest saddest song play it over and over again. Though the darkest saddest stuff in my collection is all old country music. So my Goths soundtrack is Roy A. Cuffs, godless drunk driving car crash number wreck on the highway. Hit it boys. Before anyone breaks out the eyeliner, we all sit in a circle and go through my homework. The whole thing reminds me of graduate school seminars. Except these people are smart and funny and have something interesting to say. They outline and debate the finer points of God theory. turned Gothen their early teens and they are and endr puts it so in our 30s. Step one of the guidelines is choosing a Gothename. Endr says most of us have changed our name to be something more Gothen. A lot of people legally change their name. According to Mary, if you go into any of the Goth clubs nowadays you'll find a lot of spooky names  Raven and Ratt and Sage. When I was pondering a good Gothename for myself, I page through my reference book and ask them which of invis often uses the effect of RPGs. Ж on death and dying looking for something gruesome. Nothing felt right. Maybe it's because I came of age in the 80s and I've seen blue velvet too many times, but to me, the really frightening stuff has nothing to do with ravens and rats. The truly sorted has a sunny, wasp-be glow. Therefore, I tell them the most perverse name I can think of as Becky. It turns out that by saying the magic word Becky, I have suddenly moved to the head of the class, God-wise. As Monique puts it, you are understanding the pink of God. You skip to couple levels and you went straight to pink. The group's consensus is that pink is the apex of expert God, that newcomers in Neophyte should stick with basic black, but those confident enough complex enough can exude gloom and doom while we're... the color of sugar and spice. Indra argues that paint can be intelligent, sarcastic color, though Terence says of experimenting with pink, who see with caution I can't warn you enough. As if they need to warn me, it would never occur to me to wear a pink, just as it would never occur to Michael Douglas to play a poor person. These are my people. Simp, Patrick Ho. I think that's why at that moment, I'm willing to do something with them that I was never able to do with my mom, namely, sit still while they poke and prod and paint me without complaint. I know I'm in the right hands when parents reassures me that when we're done with you, no one will call you fun. It's an astonishing. slow process. Andrew decides to make me up  the silent film star Louise Brooks, shading in concentric circles of eyeshadow and then liquid eyeliner, which takes a full five minutes to dry. She agonizes over lipstick, applies a birthmark in the shape of a snake on my cheek. Then they dress me. By the time they're done cinching up the corset and stabilizing my bustle, I'm in so many layers of black lace scarves and fringe and fishnet stockings that I could play strip poker for three weeks straight without bearing my belly button. The finishing touches are applied in a full on pit stop. I send in a chair and Monique curls my hair while parents buses with my lipstick and Mary paints my nails black all at once. I find I enjoy this loving methodical attention. I'm so pleased with the results that I keep looking in the mirror and smiling. I smile so much that Elizabeth reminds me that technically a good god is supposed to pout. But I'm too giddy. Something occurs to me. What if all of those years my mom wanted to do just this, sit me down and settle with my hair? Not because she wanted to torture me or because she was embarrassed about how I loved or because she missed your job. What if she wanted to do this for me to show me that she loves me? If all along she was trying to give me the feeling I'm getting from these strangers. I thought she was the oppressor and I was the victim. This just is true the other way around. It was time to go to the club, but after two hours of crimping, I was tired. I asked them if they were spend so much time doing their hair and makeup that they're too pooch to go out. They said that for this very reason, there is a goh rule. You have to stay at the club at least as long as it takes to get dressed up. The club we go to is called Roderick's Chamber, cheerfully named for a character in Edgar Allan Pose, fall of the house of usher. Everywhere, blackness, leather, lace, browns, and music. But while regular dance club music clips by at the pace. The club music is sluggish, slow down. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. The thing I love most about Think Guys Club is how passive it is. Hardly anyone talks to anyone else. It is free of the normal social pressures to smile, and interact, and compare content. There's none of that getting to know you pickup crap. In fact. The mood is antithetical to pickups. It's more  stay away. No one cares if you dance. No one cares if you don't. As someone who often dread strangers, the antisocial nature of this social situation makes me feel communal and part of something. One of us. hey, I hate talking to you too. It is completely liberating. The whole point of going there is despair and be... stared at. Someone walking in off the street might think what's the fun in that. And the answer is all the interaction, all the fun, all the real moments happen at home when you're getting dressed, talking to your friends about how you'll look. The club is about being seen, which is so inferior. After the mandatory two hours, I hug my gauze goodbye until I have. Usually I am. a cap driver's dream, a light, small, non-threatening. Perhaps that is why cap drivers always talk to me. But tonight I am Becky, I am God. Not a word from the driver. Bless him, he keeps staring at me and my eye makeup in the rear view mirror, watching his back. She is menacing, he's thinking, I can tell. His rear pays off. I think it's  catching me up. It's  making a sandwich. That's the way the consumers feed the boxes. But lucky that they are Brightly-Playing! him extravagantly so extravagantly that I blow my cover. He turns and gives me a lift it says thanks hon. he wants to shoot more the kind of tape people should get beat up or stay there believe she wants to shoot or  I'm a tape because  there's no such thing being a seater if they can both sit in a chair body doesn't get nervous she's not really there he wants to shoot or  I'm a tape because he knows there's no such thing door the world you're gonna have to be metal back but they run out of gas the blanket everland he wants to shoot or I'm a thief. People should get beat up. Or stay in the marable leaves. He wants to shoot warm. But I'm a thief. Because he knows there's no such thing. What's the sense? And I'm a think about the tune. When you're much too busy. Returning to the world. He wants to shoot warm. But I'm a thief. People should get beat up. Or stay in the marable leaves. He wants to shoot warm. Go! I see no, there's no such thing. Mr. Damningy Way of God. Thank you. My two life-savours. Last month, I was doing this project as a paper for a friend, where I was interviewing a lot of kids in Arts program, around the city of Chicago. And as part of the project I met this 18 year old girl named Lucille Gopens. Back when she was 16, who was sort of flooted, who was the adjoined group called Music Theater Workshop in Chicago. And it happens in kids' basically just came through the neighborhood, interviewing teenagers about their lives, and then those kids wrote a play about what they got and invited them to see it in the play, where they were. And at first when she joined the group, the other kids were scared of her. She was much tougher, much more street in a gang. Let's refer to families in the gang, which in Chicago is ended. Come on. and family relations. She yourself is served time in duty. Yeah, I would tell people, I'm , what are you looking at? Do you have a poem? What do I look  so many or am I somebody? , people be , I'm , I'm just going to do a new one. I'm , well, keep my wondering because , whatever, but don't be looking at me  that because , something to kick off. No. She's , we're open now. house with having violence  my stuff always  it's very violent. So it was one of those things that it was a mistake. Did anybody social use? No, right? Right there and then we had to get it and plus , yeah. Well  it was it was just that. If anybody even stared at me, it was   what are you looking at? Do you have a problem? Some old started off and we could just pick it up right here there. Now long after she started with a theater group, she missed two rehearsals in a row, and head of the group, Beat Paladowski with a place during the show with another girl, Rosa Rose. Then, what she came back was, especially going to her, was that this other girl, her shell, who's going to be on stage, reciting with Seah's life story, things that had happened to was Seah that were in the script. Me and another girl on the gate tell what happened when the Seah showed up again. When she was upset, she was win... Kate Beck in on my told her that Rushella taking her place she was  I'm gonna go beat her up Yeah, I'm actually was gonna I mean it was I had a stopper is and nobody needs so we have to be me Because I'm the one The game or the park , we're sent in early lunch It's a calmness. I know don't be Rushella It's all right and so and  we talked to her in eventually we split the part up. We realized how much meant to her but then she also realized that if it meant that much she needed to cover rear result Back when she entered public school,  a lot of kids from her neighborhood, who she didn't speak English, didn't do well. And she got older, she found herself getting mad at the other kids, fighting all the time. And I can't, I cannot get a decent sleep ever. I have to go, I go to school with this, with this image of my head , , , I see my mom's getting bash in the walls. It's just , I think that's what turned me into a very violent kid. , , just, , the kid's been happy. It was very tough because I was , why can I have fun  that? Why can I live  that? , why, why is this so difficult? I was really bad. I was very bad with teachers. With teachers were to even , , tell me, , you see. I'd be quiet whenever I feel that I feel that as an attack. So I was , was there gonna attack me? I should attack first. Those points were, I excite teachers, don't chairs, whatever you name it. No one, since I was a little girl growing up, I never, never had an OK day. To understand, I never had anything akin'ho face or rather some Cat Pi with my hand. So, when I was little bit cool today, it's gonna be okay. You're not gonna hear, , one of your friends did, and you're not gonna hear that coming in the house being ok, you're not gonna hear that, you're just, just a little bit okay. And that was just another thing for her. I just went so whole different world. Do you ever see a tower? Do you never met kids  the ones in the theater group? Kids were strong and independent. Let it work. and again. And the first they were literally in comprehensible, whether they could be around with each other, whether they talked to each other, she just watched them, trying to understand why they acted the way they did. Why would they so happy of it? I just started seeing , , , these kids weren't in games and, , they just had, , they had the terrible their lives, , and seeing how, , , I had a lot of them telling me, , you don't have to be so you don't have to do this in the... You mean, you empty the becaes saying you have to becaes. And then just to hear somebody from my age, to tell me that, , that, they're really true me, I was , how, , can this person's my age and they're taking  this? , why do I think  that? , I was , , I was wrong with me. They would think people are gonna divide for urging her to change, quit the gang. And Thursday should be a day for my wedding phase, but I'll actually dress for the next one. Wait, wait ha ha. Why, what, what? Why don't you have the time to have a wedding phase to attend? That's all. That's all, that's all I've been doing. You show up, man. You crying, you show up. That's all that needs to do. If you feel that  that in matter of your si. everybody else in her life is either in the gang or close to it. And I should just point out this is very common. So many gang kids that you meet in Chicago. If you ask, is anybody trying to convince you to quit the gang? They'll tell you now. And central to the change that we see ahead of the go through with this whole idea of what are you looking at? Is it okay for somebody who just looked at you without it turning into some kind of pipe? And for a long time, even in the theatre group, she struggled and she just thought, no. And if you looked at me and you can tell me in any one. way no matter how you look at me, you'll be dealt with. what so weird is that you got out of the whole thing but putting yourself in a position where you're on stage and people are looking at you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That was really , I'll be , wow, I guess I gotta give you a story. I was thinking, I can't be attacking everybody who's looking at me doing the same. Should you be standing on stage? play  in Costa and you look at and you see all the people who had you and going through your mind would be yeah what the hell are you looking for? oh  with some problem or whatever yeah I'm just oh I'm just  what are they looking at before and it's just  man should I tell him something  should I go on the mic to say if you use all have a problem what am I should I be attacking this was going to my mind A researcher at Stanford University named Shirley Bryce Heath then the remarkable study, which he sent a team of researchers into 120 after school programs for kids over the course of 10 years. And seven years into the study, she found this result that she was not even looking for. It turns out that arts programs were more effective in changing kids' lives than any other kind of program for kids, with in sports and academic programs, what in service programs. Their kids not only tended to come from worse backgrounds, kids in the upper ground, that is, they were more likely to have the parents who were employed, they were more likely to have friends who had dropped out, and more likely to get into the school. But after being in these programs, they became kids who were more likely to read the pleasure, they were more likely to honor society's good actor, honors, they were more odd. Norial started projects that were more willing to teach other kids. Shirley Bracette said that's because the arts programs tended to involve kids in more complicated collaboration. They were just doing hard. and they were critiquing it, making the clients, tangency plans, and reevaluating plans, and they weren't all these verbal skills. For study also showed that although those programs are the most effective in helping the kids who are the most at-risk in our society, they have a terrible time staying for nine out of ten of them can't find funding sources die from eight years. The program that we see was it's constantly struggling to make music data works a great program, constantly struggling to funding. I also see a documentary that this was an art school which is a bit... doing a play. Wouldn't she have changed a bit, fallen in with it? Wouldn't she have changed a few, fallen in with any group of kids who she might, who were not in gangs, who should get to know this right? And she said, absolutely not. She said, part of what helped her change. Part of what helped her fit again, go to school, specifically to do the fact that it was playing for those parts, doing what art does. If you're got it, which is changed. I think the play, the real art, the play itself, because  I said. So since it was part of my life story, stuff and play in there and... Since you're doing it over and over, it's  one of the things that you just had in the go, you put just everything. , how could I say the whole drama state of your whole life just, , just on paper, just, , let it fly over whatever, , let it be done in the car, just, , it happened, , Yeah, isn't it just the wrong? Just the wrong. The peace. Finally. So, some of the good things. Please, please. And going to sleep better. Let's be wrong by all the way from your Kishikago. Just huge, beautiful theater right up.

It's 5 or 6 guys from another game coming in slowly. screaming and representing where the max down that face will its applying everywhere and I see Roberto, my purpose is on the graph. for this chess world shrine. A lot of the ladies and the ladies start screaming from the windows. We are, can't I warn one, the old ladies are praying with the rosaries, then the cops come to investigate, takes a long time before the ambulance shows up. The cops even have time to question us, question the neighbors, and look into the bushes. The ambulance guys move really slowly, they pull out the street. the church, they taught to a cops. We scream at them, do something. Meanwhile, two other guys who shout over to them, all walking around making sure he's dying. He doesn't die, then the way to another walk by. So they changed their clothes so they can't recognize him. They took a look around to see what's there. They'd see what they'll go after when they come back. The red is so breathing. Everyone's setting up her minutes too. I hope it happens to you. The permanent is just took a look at them. , what are you saying? Take a look at Roberto. This is by his clothes. This game colors. This go chain. This is what he's much sick and they don't care. They want to go near him. They don't want to touch him. But I see him. I don't want to see him. I don't want to see him. But I see him. leading what is eyes, breathing, trying to grasp what they're , you had left. One of the permanent exists, why should we even bother? He's in a gang, we fix them up, and we'll just get shot again. I'm thinking to myself, he's still alive. Here are the saithers, besides I'm thinking to mind, please get them to do something. Finally, we take out a word, though. The trauma and the ambulance landed on the door shut and drive off. Everybody stands on the main thing I don't know what to do. But I want to run after my string or then show what we have to go through. Walk over their time, bodies and do nothing. But instead, I changed around  everyone else. I went home.

David Rackoff is pointed Toronto moved to New York when he was a teenager. He has so successfully learned to pass himself off as a native New Yorker that usually even he believes is one. And we probably sometimes yes to actually read the five birds of New York City. Please welcome Rackoff. I do not go outdoors. Not more than I have to as far as I'm concerned, the whole point of living in New York City is indoors. Do you want greenery? Or do you spend it? So, but no we can go outdoors for 8-15 minutes Paradoxically, I am being sent by an outdoor adventure magazine to climb a mountain bump Christmas Day with a man named Larry Davis. Larry has climbed Mount Monad knocking southwest in New Hampshire every day for the last five-plus years. I will join him on a cent number two thousandth in 65. The trip up to New Hampshire will involve a tiny plane from Boston. I tear my medicine cabinet apart  Billy Holiday and still only uncover one Zannax. The hiking boots, the magazine sent me to buy large, ungainly potato  things that I've been trying to break in for the past four days, cut into my feet and drool blood as if they were lined with cheese grater. I have come to hate these timberlands with a furver I usually reserve for people. I guess think this s redness burger's Alaska tteokbokki wouldn't be puede to trade up. I generally not see this, but a Latin American perovista. I wouldn't be cognizant in my just turn out to be the shoes I am caught in. It bears mentioning here that Monat not is not Everest. It is 3000 feet high and the most climb mountain in the world. It's not even a real mountain. I do not let this sway me from my worry. I have other reasons for concern. My status is in the belt perpetually teeters. on the verge of being exposed as a sham and revoked. Plus, I am only playing a reporter here. I have up to this point relied upon my relentlessly joky, believe, running mouth, loggeria, and the unborn to good graces of magazine editors who just let me make stop. I have never been sent anywhere on someone else's dime, and it takes all of my strength not to call my editor and tell him that the jig is finally up that I cannot do this piece. It seems to be... bad that the jig has to be up so far from my home in New York with its excitement , right lighting major teaching hospitals. The central grandma of my life is about being a fraud, a las, that's a completely lie, really. The central grandma of my life is actually about being lonely and thin, but fraudulence gets a fair amount of play.

In particular country charm. I have an intense dislike of flowered wallpaper, dito jam, the bowl of swords. The former is in all two abundant evidence when I enter and the latter I'm sure lies in ominous weight somewhere in the cheery kitchen. There is a naughty pan bar of the entrance hole with a setee with several empty. brighter pillows. I'd rather be golfing. On the eighth day, God created golf. Golfers have sex and some humor is golf-related manner, et cetera. The proprietor is the kind of toll-style word woman of a certain age that used to be called chants. She is approximately nine feet tall. Her eyes are blue, resolute her faithful dog Charlie on her side. She smiles at me. warmly and introduces yourself as any extending a hand to size of a fine. You must be Dave. She says, in New England, everyone calls you Dave. Regardless of however many times you might introduce yourself is David. I'm reminded of those fanatically religious homophobes, your stand on the steps of some Patrick's Cathedral during day pride, holding signs to say, Adam and Eve are not Adam and Steve with. I have always wanted to go up to them and say, well of course not having to stay. Never having to stay with. It's having to stay with. Here I am, I'm free. She continues, why don't you go into the dining room, you have some lunch and then we'll talk some. Come on, Charlie Dog. In spite of myself, I am charmed. She puts on the dark ring. and me high-welling tons and is out the door, presumably to chop the ice off the pun, deliver a calf or simply raise a barn.

Larry Davis stops by the end, as shake his hand in a hearty, hail fellow Welm Netway. As my reward, he gives me dispensation to climb the next day in my $20 plastic. pain that's shoes. I realize I've done almost no research for this clip so I walk into downtown jaffrey to check things out. This seems to smack to me of journalistic realness, a kind of topography as destiny, new journalism, Joan Didean opening perhaps? I'm taking notes by speaking into a little type recorder, perhaps that is what attracts attention. Or perhaps it is that there is not an other living creature out at five p.m. on Christmas Eve. Because a car has and immediately circles back. The driver rolls down his window and asks me if I want to lift. I do not, but how nice I think. He drives up. I'm churned by the congeniality of this interchange. How friendly, how uncreepy. I speak too soon. He circles back. He hands me rectangular package and tarten wrapping paper. Take this. The most watched video in the world. He says. This man is giving me a copy of first term which life of Jesus. I beg of politely claiming Juddiag immunity. He drives on. Who's an age-repping thought? If your therapist calls for reschedule your appointment as mine did just at the moment I finished writing this part of the story and you make it laugh as always and if you're wrapping up you say, well, I'll see you on Wednesday at 1230 then. And he responds, I'm looking forward. to it. Is that bad? I returned to the end. Now, reached in the kind of Christmas in New England, warm, heart to cheery, various similar to that Ralph Lauren would burn down the synagogue the Conqueror on his birthday. That King Cole's Christmas album plays at toothlessening decibels. I go upstairs and continue reading the New Truman Capote biography. The inserts developed with families and couples who have come for Christmas Eve dinner. Along Jewish and the wash in unkind thoughts about Christmas and the countryside as I am, I say out of sight for the most part. I can hear general revelry and prandial marimant come from the dining rooms. Finally, I had directly. to the bar of Gulf Pillows. Annie is there with a couple. Merry Christmas, Dave. She greets me. A retired airline pilot sits at the bar enjoying a decidedly unnewing glind cocktail with an orange-sized, marasino cherry and pineapple spear crowning the glass. The bartender is a woman in a sweater, knit with a portrait of a family of snow people. The wife of the couple also wears a sweater, knit with a smiling hollyfastooge teddy bear. The husband presents Annie with a very well. I've ended framed watercolor with my fasts. It's really very good. And I say so. Well, we'll put it here to keep your company, so as any prop in the frame up on the bar is still next to mine. I make sure to look at it attentively. My face froze and into the art appreciation rickters until Annie and the couple go into the dining room. I'm picking my neck, I order a snake or a red wine. I use the writer, I can answer you. Right, site. Despite the fact or precisely because this is just what I wanted, I replied my voice far too bright. Oh, I'm gonna complete it. She doesn't entirely know how to take it. She gives me the careful half smile on levels at a very large, possibly a rapid talk. The climate is the anti-medium. A man so utterly comfortable with himself that he can drink cocktail with no fewer than three different pieces of fruit in it, and still seem the very picture of the doubt would. He talks a while about fixing up houses it's what he does in his retirement. His voice is velvet soft and adequate to finish the fun to eat. But there is a sad with of mortality. The smell of old leaves underneath everything speaks out. It's a bit  watching this old house posted by both Larry. The pilot leaves fairly early in the evening. I hope he's somewhere at home. Then again, I think I don't have any where to go. Why am I so concerned with the imagined loneliness of a total stranger? Then again, again, I actually am a supplier. I'm sitting in a bar of anyone going to end on Christmas Eve. I am the writer, eating a steak drinking alone, talking, and even though I know these animals, they lazily toss bits of popcorn to charities since they put them in the costume. It's just me and bartender in my faithful bow. Plus, my day to wipe my classroom up in ignoring me. I fairly drift with often, too, so to now. I have let go of my paranoid, I beg scrutinist, I feel completely comfortable. So comfortable, in fact that inexplicably I find myself asking the bartender that is either a synagogue or a gay bar in jaffling. I clearly feel the need to out myself to hear in every possible way. Well I stopped there, I wonder, not just go ahead and ask if there is a Canadian consulate nearby. She keeps refilling my wine glasses. talk. She cuts me in enormous pieces of bakava more popcorn for the dark, and I have a mountain to climb in the morning. Dammit. My reveries, I'm done by the strange series of Glawol, Kex, and Sureds, come from below. I looked down to Charlie, the odd who's neck is arching forward and back in an ominously regular reverse parasympathetic fashion. I find the words as my voice droppers up to a fairly effeminate and vaguely hysterical pitch. I- I think the dog might be getting to... The dog is getting to... Oh my god, the dog is getting to... Oh my god, the dog is getting to... Oh my god, the dog is getting to... Charlie Romance had a small viscous puddle for witch from Mike. We can crazy bruise or I'm largely responsible. The bartender cleansed up without a second glance. Therily unmasked, I set up for dinner and take myself upstairs to sleep and do all the good night. The climb hardly bears mention me. The dog bears mention me. It was fairly awful, cold, slippery, kind of arduous, and even an ice storm. Although kind of monochromatically silvery pale and glimbers at the top, a lot of the talk focuses on 10 28s. I think we'll see on the 10 28s, she was a real 10 28, but we need to some 10 28s to make the superb Christmas. 10 28s code for babes. I realize that... everything about me, my inappropriate footwear, my effete, my succumb, my unfamiliarity with such natural phenomena as trees, rock and ice, are all met with great equanimity and good grace. They're friendly. It becomes quite clear to me that the only one testing strange glances of disapproval my way. It's me. At the summit. I made Larry take my picture a number of times. When the film comes back, I will look at the photos of myself standing them for evidence. Looking for the face of an adult, the face of a man who climbs mountains. The face of a day is... Clearly no.
