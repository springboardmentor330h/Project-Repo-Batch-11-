  "text": "that saying, it's gonna really tell you if somebody is crisis. You can really come and question this term. That's because Christmas, or the any other day in the American year, this is the day when we're all handed the same, the same stage props, the same tree, the presence, the meal, relatives, and all the same expectations. And then we all try to create more of us the same kind of day. hundreds of millions of people all set to work doing exactly the same art project. Not just any art project but a very high state art project and our project everybody cares about getting right. And in that sense the choices people make never seem clearer. In one place in witness this human drama we work is at one of the epicentres of modern Christmas. We will take this toy from hours. The story is filled with parents making one last run to the goal line of a perfect Christmas. Mark Nemes and his teenage son, Rick, you're walking the link in the story. Walking literally is quickly as men can walk without actually breaking in for a run. If I'd as your tents, they spot sales girl. You'd always win thousands or twins for  70 bucks. They're directed into out 12 C. It is stacked high with dials. The name is what's down a much time. Where are the twin dials? There's hard to heart baby who's heart really beats. There's possible sleepy soft skin. There's soft teen and miracle soft foam dial. There's baby bathalot. There's Danielle's fashion ensemble. There's baby braids. The pretty huggable fashion fair dial. There's baby tummy talks. They're in a style somewhere. Well, , actually they're not. I'm going to wage black couple themselves in the search for a dial called the sparkle dial. So guess what I didn't see. All the dolls in 11C for some reason have names that suggest the names of Starlets and adult films. So shy, Sherry, Baby Shivers, Powder Cool Twins, Previous Playmate, Debbie Attachable Accessories. It's getting very realistic of course their names are  names from adult films. Where else do you find this kind of height-up, packaged theatrical grunk of shit? There you are. Okay. They find the price sticker. on the twin style and they stand under it. I don't know. What do you think of the price? Turns out to be $90. I guess I got it together. Who's it for? My daughter. How old is she's four? We're going to be five. How come, how come, so last minute? We're going to start our business team. We bought our other things in tonight. She asked me three times The sandals come in and I said yes, and she said good because she's she's bringing me these twins So all and we didn't have it Saul. I never thought I'd be doing this at 730 and Christmas Eve I've seen it movies. I swear to God. I never thought I'd be doing this but here I am So Well, I gotta go pay for this now. Good dad I better be for 90 bucks This is the thing thing about Christmas. Christmas is given this stage on what you can prove for years. He's the same to daddy always is, but more so, , Christmas. Christmas is the time when everybody is who they normally are, but more so. Well, from WB EZ Chicago, it's American life in my reclass. If you are hearing a present for the first time, the number of public videos. around the country are just picking us up for this Christmas special. We are a new public radio show. Each week we choose a theme. In fact, variety of writers, performers, radio producers, tackle that theme. Radio monologues, mini documentaries, over-heard conversations, found tape. Anything we can think of. Today's program in three acts. Act 1. Choice our rest. Act 2. David Sidiris's Sandland diaries. Act 3. Christmas for it. Act 3. That's Sigma Freud. Sigma's. Actu. My costume is green. I wear green velvet knickers, a forest green velvet smock, and a perky little hat decorated with spangles. This is my working of one. For Christmas's ago, those were the words of introduced radio listeners across the country to David Cedaris. He's a count of working as a... serve in Sir Elf for two Christmas seasons was immediately one of the most popular stories ever broadcast in National Public Radio's morning edition only the coverage of commentator Red Barbers Dad generated more tape requests than before. It is with pleasure that we broadcasted again today the morning edition version of the Central Entire Resort and only 8 and a half minutes because the format of morning edition but here here we have the time to stretch out and please something that's much closer to David's original text. I was in a coffee shop reading what I saw. Nasey's Harold Squid The largest store in the world has big opportunities for outgoing, fun-loving people of all shapes and sizes. Working as an elf in NACI Santa Land means being at the center of the excitement. I brought the ad home in my roommate Rusty and I were laughing about it, and he dared me to call for an interview. So I did. The woman at NACI's asked, would you be interested in full-time elf or evening in weekend elf? said full time mouth. I am a 33 year old man applying for a job as an elf. I often see people in the streets dressed as objects and handing out leaflets. I usually avoid leaflets but it breaks my heart to see a grown man dressed as a taco. So if there was a cast of involved, I tend to not only accept the leaflet but to accept it graciously, saying thank you so much and thank you for your son of a bitch. It's afternoon on Lexington Avenue. I accept it a leaflet from a man. and dressed as a camcorder. Hot dogs, tacos, video cameras. These things make me sad because there's no place for them. No community. They don't fit in on the streets. I figured that at least isn't enough, I will have a place. I'll be in Santa's village with all the other elves. We live in a fluffy wonderland surrounded by candycains and gingerbread chacks. It won't be quite a sad as being some big French fry out on the street corner. I have to admit that I had high hopes when moving into New York. In my imagination, I went straight from Penn Station to the offices of one life to live. In my imagination I went out for drinks with cord Roberts and Victoria Buchanan to show his biggest stars. We'd sit in a plush booth at a Tony Cocktail lounge and they'd lift their frosty glasses in my direction and say, a toast to David Sedaris, the best writer of this show ever I'd say you guys cut it out. out. People at the surrounding tables would stare at us, whispering, is that. I might be distracted by their enthusiasm, and Victoria of Ecanic would lay her hand over mine, and tell me that I'd better get used to being the center of the attention. But instead I'm a polymphorage I was in hell. Instead, someone will say, what's that shoe size again? And hand me a pair of seven and a half slippers, pose at which curl to a point. Even worse. It's a very real possibility that I will not be hiding, that I couldn't even find works in L. That's when  you're a fellow. This afternoon I sat in the eighth floor of Santa Land office and was told congratulations Mr. Cideras, you are an elf. In order to become an elf I filled out ten pages with the forms to a multiple choice personality test under what two interviews and submitted you're in for. drug test. During the second interview we were asked while we wanted to be Elle, so it should be think about it's a fairly top question. I told the interviews that I wanted to be now because it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. I figured that for once in my life I would be completely honest and see how far I got me. I failed to be drug test. My year-on-head roaches in the stems from the minute but still they hired me and honestly had nothing to do with it. They hired. me because I'm short. Everyone they hired is short. I am one of the taller elves. I've spent the last several days sitting in a crowded window this macy's classroom undergoing the first phases of health training. We have been addressed by all sorts of instructors who begin their presentations by saying, this looks  an outstanding group of elves. bosses have led us in motivational cheers, a concept which stuns me to the core. Following an eight-hour day of cash register training, we retreated to a video presentation by the security staff, visited by interpreters for the death, and presented with the Elf and Guy, a 40-page booker of rules and regulations. This afternoon's training concluded with a tour of Sandland. the Williams. It's a wonderland with 10,000 twinkling lights and diversions. People enter and walk through a maze which affords views and mechanical dancing pantones, train sets, spinning bears and really big candy games. They walk through a quarter mile of maze and wind up the magic tree, at which point they brace themselves for Santa. The tree is a tunnel designed to resemble a complex system of roots. The child is supposed to think I can't love the Canadianjeans!!!! We get looks  a large scientific model of human intestinal tract. Once he passed the magic tree, the lights dim. It's dark beyond that tree. It's dark because Macy's is not what people know that there are six houses. Macy's wants people to think that there is only one house, and one Santa and he lives at Macy's. They constantly refer to the movie, Miracle on 34th Street, but even if someone believed in one Santa, while they believed in the final story, nobody less than a final The Santa houses are cozy and intimate, lady poems. Each house has a hidden camera. This afternoon we learn the names of various self-dicisions. You can be, for example, and oh my god, and stand at the corner near the escalator. People arrive, see the long line around the corner, and say oh my god. In your job, you can tell them that it won't take more than an hour to see Santa. You can be in Antoinette, a water cooler elf, a bridge elf, a train elf, a maze elf, island elf, magic window elf, emergency exit elf, counter elf, magic tree elf, pointer elf, Santa elf, photo elf, a busher elf, cash register elf or exit elf. We were given a demonstration of various positions in action. Backed out by returning elves who was so on stage and goofy that it made me a little sick of my stomach. I don't know that I could look anyone in the eye and explain, oh my goodness, I think I see Saint-Tap, or can you close your eyes and make a very special Christmas wish? Everything these elves say seems to have an exclamation point on the end of it. It makes one's mouth hurt to speak with such force, marionette, and embarrasses me to hear people talk this way. I prefer being frank with children. I'm more likely to say, we must be exhausted, or I won't be possible. I know a lot of people who would kill for that little wasteland of course. I'm afraid I won't be able to provide enthusiasm Santa to his asking for it. I think I'll be a low key to what he's about. Today was Alphdresbury, Hersel. The lockers and dressing rooms are on the eighth floor and directly behind Santa's eye. People have gotten to know one another of the past four days of training, but once we took off our clothes. and put on our costumes, everything changed. Ivy, the woman in charge of costume, handed out our uniforms, gave us a lecture on keeping things clean. She held up a calendar and said, ladies,  what this is, use it. I have scraped enough blood out from the crotch's of elf knickers to last me the rest of my life. And don't tell me, I don't wear underpants. I'm a dancer. You're not a dancer. If you were a real dancer, you wouldn't be here. You're going to wear panties  an elf. My costume is green. I wear green velvet knickers, the forest green velvet smile, and the turkey little hat that created the spankles. This is my working friend. During Dressby Hersle, I worked as a Santa Elm for house number 2. A Santa Elf reads children's magic tree, and reads in the Santa's house. When he works as a Santa Elf, you have to go buy your elf name. My elf name is Crumpen. The other elf have names  Junk on it, Froth. They take the children by the hand in the squeal and enforce the line. They sing and prance and behave  cartoon characters come to life. They cry to me. Today was the official opening day of Santa Land and I worked as a magic window well, a Santa El and a national. The magic window was located in the adult, quick peep-lunch. My job is to say, step on the magic store. and look to the window and you can see Santa. I was at the magic window for 15 minutes before a man approached me and said, you look so stupid. I had to admit that he had a point and still. I wanted to say that at least I get paid to look stupid but he gives the way for free, but I can't say things  that because I'm supposed to be married. So instead I said, thank you! Thank you! This is if I had misunderstood and thought he had said, you look terrific, thank you! He was a brawny wise guy, wearing a final jacket and carrying a bag in the radio shack. I should have said, real loud, sorry man, I don't date other guys. People would have turned and looked away and he would have crawled into a little ball and died. All the scientists have different routines. Some want the children's names, so as you're leading the youngsters from the magic tree you say, what was your name again? Write on the tip of my mind where I can't get ahead. Then they say their name and you say, that's right, and fan, you're van. See, I didn't recognize you with that turtle neck. That's new, isn't it? And it's always new because they grow so fast, they're always meeting Roger Clubs. Then you lead them to Santa's door and say, let me just check and see if he's ready. And you poke your head in and whisper, fan. Then half the time you're lush of the child in the house and Santa will say, stand, it's so good to see you. It's hard when you have three or four kids in a group. It's hard to keep the name straight. Some of the names are names I've never heard. Venisha, fontage, great, a child named great. I'm great. That's the name which is bound to prove challenging once it gets old enough to start sleeping around. And... And... And... And... And... And... This afternoon I was photo well for Santa Howard. Santa Howard uses names and sits the kids on his lap and asks if they've been going in the morning. They want the Christmas. And then he asked what they planned to leave in my Christmas Eve, and they said cookies and milk , and he asked what kind of cookies and they said chocolate chip or whatever. He demands the photo well to say, chocolate chip, that sent his favorite kind of cookie. I don't mind saying it, but I must have said it 60 times today. This afternoon Santa Howard got an Asian child who wasn't familiar with the idea of leaving cookies. Santa asked what she was going to leave in the eat and she got a positive look on her face. He said something round to eat and she said, a potato. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Twenty-two thousand people came to see Santa today and not all of them were well-behaved. Today I witnessed fist fights and vomiting in that magnificent canotrums. It's a line gets long. We break it into four different lines. We can say. when they're right-minded, but leave, they knew it would take over two hours to see Santa. Two hours, you could see a movie, two hours. Standing in a two-hour line makes people worried that they're not living in a democratic nation. I was set into the hallway to direct the second phase of the line. The hallway was packed with people, and all of them seemed to stop me in the question, which way did the down escalator, which way did the elevator, the patio restaurant, gift-grab, the women's restroom, trimotry. It was a line for Santa. and a line for the women's bathroom. In one moment after asking me a thousand questions already, asked, which is the line for the women's bathroom? And I shouted that I thought it was the line with all the women in it. She said, I'm gonna have you fired. I had two people say that to me today. I'm gonna have you fired. Go ahead, be my guest. I'm wearing a green velvet costume. It doesn't get any worse than this. Who do these people think they are? I'm gonna have you fired. And I want to lean over and say, I'm going to have you killed. This morning I got stuck at the magic window, which is really boring. I'm supposed to stand around and say, step on the magic star and you can see Santa. I said that for a while. And then I started saying, step on the magic star and you can see share. And people got excited. So I said, step on the magic star and you can see Mike. Tyson. Some people in the other line, the line to sit on Santa's lap, got excited and cut to the gates and they could stand on their magic star. Then they got angry when they looked to the magic window and saw Santa, rather than share with my Tyson. But what did they honestly expect? If share so hard up from money that she would agree to stand behind the two way mirroring naces. The angry people must have said something to manage it. Because I was taken off the magic star, Santa, Alpha Island, which is really boring. This all you do is stand around neck and airing. At noon a large group of departed people came to his Santa, passed me on my little island. These people were profoundly retired. They were rolling their eyes and wagging their tongues and staggering towards Santa. It was a large group of departed people, and after seeing them from 15 minutes, I could not begin to guess whether we targeted people and they, and the regular New Yorkers began. Everyone looks to be targeted once you're second-born to me. This morning I worked as an exit house, telling people in a loud voice, this way out of Santa Lan. A woman was standing at one of the cash registers, paying for her pictures while her son light beneath her, kicking and eating, having a tantrum. The woman said, while if you don't start behaving yourself, I'll sound as not going to bring you any of those toys you asked for. The child said he is too going to bring me toys liar. He already told me. Good woman grabbed my arm and said you there else. Tell Riley here that if he doesn't start behaving immediately then Santa's going to change his mind and ring him call for Christmas. I said that Santa changed his policy no longer trapex and call. Instead if your bad he comes to your house, steal things. I told Riley that if he didn't behave himself. It was going to take away his TV and all his electrical appliances. You can knock. All your appliances, Riley, including the refrigerator. Your food is going to spoil and smell bad. It is going to be so cold and dark where you are. You're going to wish you never even heard that he's in the hospital. The woman got a worried look on her face and said, All right, that's enough. I said he's going to take your car, furniture, and all your towels and blankets, if you would not. The mother said, no, that's enough, really. Two new Jersey families came today to see Santa. Two loud, ugly husbands with two wives and four children between them. The children gathered around Santa and had their pictures taken. When Santa asked the 10-year-old boy what he wanted for Christmas his father shouted, oh woman, get em' Woman's Santa! These men were very loud and irritating, constantly laughing and jostling them out. The two women sat on scientists lap and had their pictures take. And each ass Santa for a kitchen aid brand dish washer and a decent win or comb. Then the husband's Santa on satin's lap. And when asked what he wanted for Christmas, one of the men yelled, I want a broad with big jogs! The man's small, breasted white, cross-door arms over chest. Looks  the floor where did you see it? The man's son tried to laugh. Fine. Hello. How are you doing tonight? What do you up to tonight? What are you drinking? I think I'll have whatever you have. I could use the change. I will make Rusty gave me these lines. I don't have any idea what to say to people on clubs and bars. I'm free. up and with her away, but Rusty tells me these lines work. Either. I was just standing across the room who couldn't help but notice that your glass is empty, can I buy you the drink? I think I'll have whatever you want to have. This evening I was in May's health, nothing is more boring than being in May's health. Other May's health's address children may ask, what do you want for Christmas? But really, why should a child tell an elf? Santa is who they come to see. This seems pathetic for an elf. try to out shine Santa. After children have passed the dancing penguins they don't care if they ever see another elf as long as they live. The maze is overpopulated with elves. This evening I was stationed in the maze near the candycains. Children would pass, bored, and I'd say, I didn't. What do you love to receive me? Go. I'll write whatever you're happy. I've met El Smoll Walks in life. The recession is hit in your very heart. Most of the other El Smolls of Show business people, but several of them had real jobs at advertising agencies, the brokerage files. Bless their hearts. These people never in their wildest dreams figured that was about the cost in way new to each other. They're the really bitter ones. Most of the El's are young, high school and college students. They're young and they're kids. and one of the job perks is that I get to see these people on their underpants. The overall cutest elf is a fellow from Queens and Richie. His elf name is Snowball and he tends to ham it up on the children. Sometimes tumbling down the path, Santa's house. I generally gag when elves get that cute, but Snowball is hands down and adorable. You want to put a meaner pocket. Yesterday, Snowball and I worked with Santa Elves and I got excited when he started the same thing  I'd follow you to Santa's house any day. it made me dizzy, the slantation. I met afternoon I was running into walls, by late afternoon snowball, cool man. By the end of our ship we were in the bathroom, changing our clothes and all of the sudden we were surrounded by five sanders and three other elves. All of them were guys and snowball had been sirting when. Snowball just leads elves on. Elves and sanders. Later on we were in the elevator and I heard him say to his friend. I don't know what these guys all want, but they give me the creeps away they spare. Snowball is playing against me. It's one thing to get a child fired up and really don't want to be working under the Children's Centre. More of David Cedera's is Sandaline Diaries, and Christmas Roy in a minute, when there are problems with seniors. the änd nausea glass, special Christmas edition of our program, we continue to give it to the earth's assuming diamonds. Out of all the sand, as two are black and both are so light-skinned, that with the beard and makeup you've never know they weren't white. Yesterday a black woman got upset after having requested a Santa of color, she was sent to will. He's not black, and he was said. We've shared the woman that yes, he was black and woman said, well he isn't black enough. Will is a difficult thing. and tongue, moody and unpredictable . He spends a lot of time staring off in the space. When a boss tells Will that we need to speed things up, Will gets defensive and says, Listen, I'm playing a role here. Do you understand? I dramatic role that takes a great deal of preparation. I was the pointywealth this afternoon when the woman approached me in whispered, we would  a traditional Santa. I'm sure  what I'm talking about. I sent her to Will. Last Saturday, Snowball was a point when the woman said, Last year we had a chocolate center. Make sure it doesn't happen again. Snowball Center, too well. I spent time at the Magic Wingo with an elf named Rita. A dancer who was in the process of making a video with all girls singing from. We talked about one thing in the... and she told me that she's appeared on a few soap operas. I asked if she'd done one life to live and she said yes. She'd had a bit part as the Flunningco dancing two years ago in Cordon Tina, remarry, and had their honeymoon in Madrid. Suddenly, I remembered Rita perfectly. I remember Cordon Tina's honeymoon  it was yesterday. Rita wore a red lacy Flunningco dress and stomped around the shiny nightclub floor, Mustangs greatest doorfire challenge called to do. Rita said to Cored, don't do it, Sinior. You'd be a fool to fight with Spain's greatest bullfighter. Rita told me that Cored and Tina's honeymoon was filmed right here in New York which surprised me. I really thought they went to Spain. Rita told me that she performed to Flamengo dance in the morning, then they broke for lunch. She was in the one-light to live cafeteria, and Tina went to Overton, where Rita had lunch with Tina. She said Tina was very sweet, but all she talked about. that was her love for Smokey Robinson. Tina fell in love with Smokey Robinson in real life. She drove away between Smokey and his wife and left the show so that she could move to Los Angeles and be Smokey. I'd read that in the soap opera digest, and it was really the hear it from someone who knows the whole story. Later I was working to hash register and Stephanie, one of the managers, told me that her friend Carol was a person responsible for restricting on one life from her. Replacing the old team with the new team. I told you. told Stephanie that I liked the new team up, and she said, well, tell my friend Carol, she'll be happy to hear it. Then Michael, another one of the managers got involved, told me he's been out one life to live seven times. He placed Clint New Cannon's lawyer five years ago, when happy to be Cannon family was on trial from the murder of Mitch Lawrence. Michael knows Victoria because he can't be personally. And says she's just sweet and caring and real light that she is on the show. He said that Clint tends to keep to himself, and it goes a lot of fun. I keep believe I'm hearing these things. I know people who don't see the core, we can make it. And holding it, I'm getting closer. I can see them. Today a child told Santa that he wanted his dead father. other back and a complete set of teenage mutant duty curtains. Everyone loves those turtles. A child came to Santa this morning and his mother said, alright, Jax. Alright, tell Santa what you want. Tell him what you want. Jax and said, I want crocked in and gamble to stop animal pestering. The mother said, proctor, Jax and that's proctor and gamble. What do they do to him? Did they torture animals? Jacean is that what they do? Jacean said yes. They tortured. He was really 16 years old. Tonight a man proposed to his girlfriend and sent a house number 5. Santa asked what he wanted for Christmas and he pulled the ring out of his pocket and said that he wanted this woman to be his wife. They thought it well, got jumped up and started crying. I got a new haircut in a few people complimented me for the did register. I spend all day lying to people saying you look so pretty and Santa can't wait to visit with you all he talks about. It's just not Christmas without you. You've sanded his favorite person in the entire Christ's daydreaming. Francis Laira is treating me. Aren't you the princess of Rangovia? Santa said that a beautiful princess was coming to visit him. He said she would be wearing a red dress and that she was very pretty but not stuck up for two face. That's you, is it? I lay it on the parents now, in the words, thank you and I'm going to die. To one child I said, you're a model aren't you? The girl was maybe six years old and she said, yes I'm a model but I also act. I just got a second call. The girl's mother said, you may recognize Kate and something up, my first 70 campaign. She's pictured on the box. I said, yes, of course. All I do is lie, that has made me be in the consciousness. This afternoon I was stuck being photo well for Santa Santa. Santa Santa. I don't know his real name, no one does. During most days, there was a slow period when you sit around the house and talk to Santa. And most of them were nice guys and you sit around in the lab. But Santa Santa takes himself a bit too serious. I asked him where he lives, Brooklyn or Manhattan, and he said, Hey, I live at the North Pole with Mrs. Claus. I asked what he does rest in the year and he said, I make toys for all the children. Santa Santa sits in waves and jingles. his bell-sash and no one is there. He actually recited the 94 Christmas and it was just the two of us in the house, no children, just us. He says, Oh little elf, little elf, straighten up those maddo-toys for Santa. I reminded him that I have a name, comment, and then I straighten up the stuff. And then I straighten up the stuff. Oh little elf, little elf, bring Santa a throat-loss-inch. So I brought him-loss-inch. Santa in life with this lamp. Children, they'll talk to them and give a hearty chuckle and ring his bells, and then he asks them to make their favorite Christmas Carol. Most of them say Rudolph the Red Nose Ring here. Santa then asks them to sing it for him. Children are shy and don't want to sing out loud. So Santa Santa says, Oh the love, the love! Hope young Brenda here sing that favorite Carol of hers. Then I have to stand there and sing Rudolph the Red Nose Ring here, Chai Hain. the afternoon a child said she didn't know what her favorite Christmas Carol wants. Santa Santa suggested way in a manger. The girl agreed to it but didn't want to sing because she didn't know the words. Santa Santa said, oh the love little girl comes sing away in the manger for us. Didn't seem fair that I should have the son on her. So I told Santa that it didn't know the words. Santa Santa said of course  the words come now sing. So I sang it the way Billy Holiday might have said she Well for wait No cream For a day, the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. Santa Land finished. The evening I was sent to be a photo-wealth and house number two. The camera is hidden in the fire place and I take the picture by pressing the button on the end of the court. Most bells will hold up a stuffed animal over the fireplace and say, look at my little animal friend in smile! Oftentimes the parent will settle the child on Santa's lap and then start grooming. I see modest. full cans of hairspray from their pocketbooks and spray the child's hair as if Santa were a false prop made out of cement. Hairspray shoots in the Santa's eyes and eat winses in paint. Once the child starts crying, it's all over. Parents had planned to send these pictures as cards or store them away from child's grown can lie, claiming to remember the experience. Tonight I saw a woman slap and shake her crying child, she yelled, wait you'll get on that man slap and smile, I want to be- something to cry about. Then she sat Rachel on Santa's lap and her picture was supposedly means on paper that everything is exactly the way it's supposed to. That everything is snowy one. It's not about the child or Santa or Christmas or anything, but the parents I do are well but nothing. David Cideris is sent around Aries, a published in his book, Barrow Feaver, is for coming book of stories, it's called Naked. I'm going to be tonight. Santa Baby, a 50th or convertible to light blue. I'll wait up for you, be Santa Baby. So hurry down the gently tonight. All right, three. Christmas for it. On the Upper East Side near the City of the F-scale department store barnes is chosen. and odd tactic for its Christmas decorations. Amon. They don't refer to Christmas. It's  an, , you got to respect the kind of contrarian street. Instead, each of their department store windows is dedicated to different Amos people of 20th century. That would remember. Bealya, picture is video monitors, also images and colors and lights. The subjects of the windows, Frank Sinatra, the beat poets, great bonds of the 20th century, Martin Luther King, and sing. Freud. Only one of these windows has a live human being in it, and it's the Freud window. Human being is a third-ish, dear-ded actor named David Rackov. I am the ghost of Christmas of Conscious. I am the auntie's center. I am Christmas Freud. People tell me what they wish for. I tell them the ways that wishes are on healthy or wish for an error. My own presentation merely involves me sitting in a chair either writing more reading times on the interpretation of dreams, every Saturday and Sunday into a Christmas. I sit in the mock study facing that of the Snapdragon U at 61st Street. My study has direct visit chair and couch. It's also equipped with a motorized track on which a video camera wielding baby carriage travels back and forth. A slight projector, a large revolving black and white spiral tube hanging torses and about 10 video monitors that play for right related text and images. When I sit down in the chair for the first time, I'm suddenly horrified at a female age in the past. I have no idea how I'm going to get for four weeks in sitting here on the spray. And this role raises unprecedented performance questions for me. For starters, I have no idea that there were people outside my window. I opt for covering my entire center of the kind of London human species. If they want twinkles, that's saddest to be heard. I'm not at my two fears. One that I'm being upstage by the end of Evans's wig in the blonde's window, and two that a car will suddenly lose control, come barreling through my window and kill me, and ignore both the end to be sure, a life given in the service of retail. Sometimes for no clear reason, entire crowds make the collective decision. not to breach or respectful six foot distance from window. Other times they crowd in a tempting to read what I'm writing over my shoulder. I thank God my original handbrake. Easily half the people have no idea who I'm spending me. They wait as if Freud was Garfield the cat. Other snap photos. The waves are the kind of tiny juvenile handcrenches on gives to something either impossible, young and tiny, or a dorybly fluffing. Oh look, it's Freud. Isn't he just the cutest thing? you ever saw? Or I just want to bundle him up and take him home. They're also the folks who are more concerned with whether or not I'm real. This I find particularly a laughable since we're on Earth where they make mannequins. My friend David came up yesterday and was writing out when people were saying outside. He really looks  him only younger. Hey, that's a real guy. He just earned a pay to see a lot of do-to-do? Who is that professor Higgins? If psychoanalysis was late 19th century secular Judaism's way of finding spiritual meaning in a post religious world and retail is the late 20th century's way of finding spiritual meaning in a post religious world What does it mean? I'm person living of father, sacred houses, and a store window to commemorate her religious holiday. In the window, I fantasize about studying the entire Christmas-fried movement. Christmas-fried everywhere, providing grown-ups and children alike with the greatest gift of all, inside. In department stores across America, people deep display window, couch and snifflingly, meaningfully whispering. Thank you, Christmas-fried. Taking his hand further than the holiday angst, if not to see. spelled at least brought into start relief. Christmas right on the cover of cigar, Fishunato magazine. Christmas right on friends. People grumbling that here it is not even Thanksgiving and already stores are running out of Christmas for its face asking the question, what do women want for Christmas? If it caught on all the stores would have to compete for a good man with me. into action with the CG Young Windberg, a mere perfect simulation of a repair cave. While the Melanie Klein Windor at 1910 would have them lined up six deep, and neighborhood groups would object to the saliva and constant bell ringing in the baby gaps BF's killer remember. There's not speaking me out some near-not-sign, but right now, ready something down. I hope it's his firm remember. How do I indicate to the woman in the fur coat, in the neverland Christmas Freud fashion, of course, we get real guns in the name. Then again, how does one cruise someone through a department store window? Should I press my own phone number up against the glass? some polar bear in the zoo holding up a sign reading, help on being held prisoner. One day I come up to the store for a photo up for a news story about the holiday windows of New York. It is my 32nd birthday. One pair with little girl. and then Sasha, it's her birthday as well, she is turning ten. She's strikingly beautiful and appears in the upcoming Howard Stern movie. She's to be my patient for the photographers. In true psychoanalytic fashion, I make her lie down and face away from me. I explained her a little bit about Freud, and we play a word association. I say, center. She responds, of attention. I ask her her dreams and aspirations for this becoming 11th year of her life. To make another feature in half my role on one life to live continue. She sells every word she says to me smiling with both sets of teeth or gem  eyes clearing. She might as well be seeing cranty the entire garden. Her cheek is charming. I experience extreme counter-transference. I read a bit from the interpretation of dreams to her. Is this boring? Perhaps? Oh no, it's relaxing I've been working since five o'clock this morning keep going. Even though her eyes are closed, she senses the light from the news cameras up. She curls the wards with black and white, and the glasses with dolly were stuck in the unchild- manner. Glass of the window fairy frogs up. My photo-op with Sasha means he can be positioned to start seeing patients throughout the sleep. I'm simply not bad at it. exposed to wind or wind. It's too humiliating and boring. My patients have often been right now. Perhaps it's because of the couch face is a way from above the street and myself with the sessions of surprising the end to bed. But it's more than that. The window is weirdly enough very cozy, more  a child that's right away in their social home. Patients seem to relax immediately and remind them. Tea begins the session laughing at the glass of care that's participant actually prior to a second. Christmas Friday's preparing. Jay has near-pricpling tents and I have to see where the students are. People watching from the campus are fashion. She wears a dress with low-end and bright green red red. Gee, a journalist likes to talk with children and write about them. Perhaps that's why his shirt is a regular button. I'm told that a woman outside the window wondered a lot of unsanctual families. I'm supposed to wear a mask. He wanted to stand in jeopardizes and her credibility in my mind. I've scheduled our next session for the Windart Barney, I hope that's okay. Huh. You seem really resistant to the wind. A journalist is doing a story on the windows for the times. He asked me if this is a dream. dream come true. Well, it is a dream. It's logical I'm alive. One of my parents is the psychiatrist and the other one is the department's throat winter. He doesn't laugh at my job but it's half true. One of my parents is the psychiatrist. The other is an MD who also does psychotherapy. I've been in therapy myself for seven years. The difference between seeing or showing you can be in your shrink is not only less pronounced than I imagined it might be. intoxicating. When my own therapist of seven years says, I have fantasy of coming by the window and being treated by him, I think. Of course you do. I feel finally and blissfully Victorians. My father tells me a dreamy hat in which I have essentially analyzed and exposed him. It's the only indication I've gotten from him so far that he's anything other than amused by what is basically a mockery and what he does. In a certain sense, I'm not just aping my father and my mother. But also in a way, therefore, man has fallen their profession. And when I sit there, a patient on my couch pipe in my mouth listening, it feels so... Perfect. any psychiatrist is key that I know enough, growing up in front of my own ears, and couch to ask open-ended questions. To let the silence is played themselves out or not. To say gently, on time is a after 45 minutes. The charade feels real. The conclusion of the equation here is in the making. Even the media coverage for this excavator's extensive and strange. People from newspapers and television are asking me deep questions about the holiday, the nature of alienation at this time of year. Things  that, as I actually was Freud. It's disconcerting because with very little effort I could be drunk with the power. but it also points out the oh Henry gift of the magic quality at all. The media is so desperate for any departure from the usual holiday stories they have to turn out they come flocking and yet the public doesn't really even want to read about the holiday in the first place. It's  trying to jazz at the meal note he wants to eat anyway. I get a call from the store that Alan Ginsberg might even be spending a lot of Sunday and if he wants to what I speak to him. I have no sway over Mr. Ginsburg, but if he is something he'd  to talk about, I'm certainly available, I tell him. Not entirely true, I'm pretty well built. The whole lounge Ginsburg thing depresses me a bit. Then again, if he can see it as a cosmic joke, why can't I? I feel indignant, very territorial. In post-urzone, but no real ones in the window. Anyway, it's moving, he doesn't show up. There's a street fair outside that seems to have brought a decidedly scary or type of spectator. They're  the crowded carnival nun, the dog face boy. A grown woman sticks her tongue out at me. Later during a session, a man in his 50s presses his nose up against the window, getting grease on the glass, presses his ears up to hear and screams things at me I can't offer here. When I leave after each stint, I put up a little glass sign reads, Freud will be back soon. It's  a warning. The postmodern version of Christ is coming. Repent. Freud will be back soon where the youth  it will be learned. Freud will be back soon, stop deceiving yourselves. In the affluent downtown neighborhood in Toronto and Richard was raised, someone had spray-pied on a wall, Mow lives, which someone else had added. My window is a haven in midterm. I can sit there, unmindful of the crushing meows in the store. The hour badly spent over gifts to stop and see him desperately bought. Because I sit there, I hear the songs that play for the display in one window over the blonde room and the sunshine. Dore stasing in once I had a secret loud. May west singing, my old flame Marlena Dietrich singing, falling in love again. I listened, I feel that they're really referring to my window. He's drawing. Every time they come up on their feeding team, I found the most unfairly poignant. With all their talk of clandestine love, their obficiation, painfully hidden romantic and gender . But they might also just as easily be referring to this time of year, with the aching sadness and loneliness that seems to be in view everything. Where is that perfect object? That old flame, that secret. I'm fine, Mom. I'm purchasing Mom. This is my final weekend. I'm starting to feel good. I'm just paying for it. I started off as a monkey on display and I wound up uncomfortably caught between joking and serious. A persona that seems laughable at times. I know this will pass, but for now I want nothing more to continue to sit in my chair, someone unhouching to ask me if real concern. So come. I knowBut You This Christmas vine, Christmas vine, this Christmas vine in the window, In側 clue, in側 clue, The game, Subnamay, Subnamay, Soon it will be Christmas day. See, side was, see, side was, All the roses and fear. Still, remember, be a beautiful promise, a complex, then there's your dream. That's a drag, we... Come is driving us crazy. Some cigars are only cigars, oh, Christmas Friday, Christmas Friday, Christmas Friday, secrets must fight in the window, in the window, in the window, in the window, I'm a friend, our time is now all. I think it's time for one word. First share himself. Even it says on the box there, since there for Daddy. Hey, Monster Side's in the middle. 36th. John Stan, all the time he sends. Putting this question on your screen. How? Wow! What are you doing? Look at the market. What is it there? What's the market? What's the market? How about that when you  it? John is John Conner, Chuck of DJ. He provides a lot of music for the American life. He is fast and strange, rapid collection. And on this, third. Christmas of sight is given exactly the present. He asked for it. Close and play record play. Speed's fine. That's one of the cool set of Cameron. He picture it in his presence. You  it? Cameron is first on my graph. OK, baby. Why? Jimmy. Long on the ball, you want 30 batteries? You just put little batteries in there. That's not that big. We wouldn't have left points. I have deteriorates from there. I'm just a little bit scared. I should have gotten a nice one from Santa Claus. That's what I should have got. This right here? This is what Christmas is all about. These pose that are ready and be straining to be happy. Everybody has this picture in their heads in perfect Christmas. And of course it's never going to be perfect because it's never going to leave up to them. and so disappointment is built into the very structure of the dead. And so the best you can help for are Christians. And I say this is a Jew. Somebody who has never celebrated the holiday, which makes me an outside observer and in partial observer. The best you can do is to ride the imperfections. Hope they don't have to take everybody. In the state from 1926, John's parents spent a lot of time trying to keep him from destroying the new train set in the very first day he gets it. Applegate. Yeah, that's right. That's right. You're right. You're right. This is Kittalina. I love one. We are a genre's train so fast. It always pass. Well, don't turn it so fast, man. Look at this. Don't look at it with that. Oh, oh. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. for a while while boyhood's disaster, for a choice for feelings to point you. And listening back to its happens. By three year old DJ, put a 45 of Winchester Cathedral in the Zure record player. The ones that came to the fast. Queensborough keeper clicks off.
