  "text": "Not all in go. The guy you've headed to youth did, the covenant press between church, decided to home to the day. Half the kids knew you through a pet argue for Christianity. Half the kids had to make the case. The Christianity was all made up. Very tale. And the Christmas loss. And I think the number one reason why is it is that you try to just come out with the long films. Dan Adamson is the youth man. And it was amazing to watch these films. The ones that were the new Christmas film. Jesus is real. There's people that found this proof. I feel  I could go grab a lot of those records. And what was so awesome, I've been on Christian Bate, say, said, fine, we totally acknowledged that Jesus's so was Muhammad, so was Buddha, so was his. And the Christians were , yeah, but Jesus is real, and he died in the cross and he rose again. And the Nacris came out and said, well, there's people that believe that, but there's also people that believe Muhammad's. And what I wish the Christians would have done, what a bit sad. I believe God is real. It's changed. Put myself on the way to sleep. Here's what I was before that year's school. Problem is, for the teenagers in this neighborhood, for a year's story was before I found God, it has no meaning. They all come from families that discussed the Bible, dinner, church every Sunday. They come from the kind of homes where all the kids can tell you how many squares are in the pictures and they're meeting with me over there already before that we had one. as every TV show in film is pre-screen. Kids that are willing to serve kids that know the Bible. No, they're theology. This is not true, they've known. Didn't call from the very beginning of that mouth sound. Just as they're safe. Same as these lusts. It's quite interesting. It's time for them to develop an own thing. Not just the paragraph back with the parents say. Dan says this, but some parents say it. We need to question what they find and come to their own conclusions. Don't do it. and then says to do it later, that parents and youth pass the emergency in the world God. So they decided to take them from West Virginia. It will be a mission set. The youth groups first missions set that will help for people that have to testify about God's word strangers, to be hard. And hardship can make you turn to God. And they see the kind of things that make people engage serious questions about it. If they didn't doubt because they looked in this world, they see hard work. lives and was they see people that are hurting and they see this male couple who think why we've got them. So that was the plan. Now let's meet some of the teenagers. Kelly Hoover's age 14 on ground care, braces, with gloss. Kelly's outgoing and bright. And she's... somebody capable of saying exactly what the song is . Well, I really want to use it because they are. I mean, I don't want to sound  crying or anything, but I'm more privileged than what I'm talking about. I mean, I wasn't doing house ever before. And I don't really see to the lot to don't have as much variety. When I really want to be what it's , I can't hold living with them. And I really do want to teach them about these, because I don't know how to love it. And sometimes I think how it lasted was, we born and started to be family. Welcome to the BBE's Pago Public Radio International, it's a American life in our class. Today in our program, the teenagers guide to God, story of five adults, 11 kids, and six days in West Virginia, of adults, trying to mold the faith of teenagers, and things not working on the place plan. It's a not fact that we're just life in America, that in this country, founded by Christians, in which majority of people say they believe in God, and identify themselves as Christians. So many religious Christians feel that they are in a crest of an army. They say the media doesn't share their values, secular institutions, undermind their beliefs. The job of raising Christian children will tell you, is  trying to do God's work from behind enemy lines. Today we are devoting our entire program to the kids that they are struggling to bring up. This American life produces Susan Burton and I spent a week this August, according to these teenagers, day and night, rapid mission trip. We bring you this portrait of what it means to be a Christian teenager in America. Some kids around the world, and they say what's. Hac one. Exodus. The youth group was part of covenant press between church and Chicago, a city church with lots of members who we've happened to sublands. And there were the parents who were founding members in church, less than two decades ago. These teenagers were 13. 17 they all grew up attending Christian schools and homeschools. I tripped again in the fourth-nourde drive in two-rated bands who wasn't in the world. What did  about? I remember her name. I heard you heard the summer in your home, summer and your home, oh it's so funny. We were barely in the band 10 minutes when Marisa and Pele had stayed in the late summer and became the unofficial theme song for a trip. Wasn't by George of Play or DC Talker and any other Christian pop music. with CDs we brought. It was a rap song by a white one-hit wonder way down of LFO. Everybody's spent the ride down and I remember I was the lyrics. Oh, I missed it! I missed the Billy Shakespeare. I'm waiting! I saw it! Okay, I'll be back! Okay, I'll be back! I started over! You got it! Yes, who kept it a Larry Bird? What did he say? What did he say? Dan is 29. Mary, the new baby. But in the band, he's more  a counselor. and build by his campers, then you pass them. They go to stand their next and try to meet his eyes in the rearview mirrors and talk, asking what he and one of the other leaders, they go back and polished together, the evocatively named Ludy Vibal Institute. He's in the way about the songs he writes, which, so I said concerning art and possibly old, and maybe 15 years. He tries to satisfy his anybody's words to some of them. From a complete میں, what's called나�w! Help!? Was out to be king That's too 80s for me. He says I couldn't watch it He's girls are the children that the Christian Wright has in mind when he holds press conferences and what's it's day , they're the culture word. They are cannon fodder in their work Just be used where they were born child psychologists named James Dawson to the group called Focus on the Family. It is an enormous religious organization based in Colorado Springs. Topson's genius is that he offers exhausted, concrete advice when everything can child discipline to move he down. To a generation of parents can kind of raise their kids in a new way, a rather real way. As part of that, Topson has built an entire superstructure, the shield young people, Hollywood, Rap Music and WD. Focus on the family publishes an ongoing psychic Cover. Wowár system! It evaluates pop culture and Christian perspective, parents. In addition, they created an empire of Christian pop around the original radio dramas and children's videos, both websites and several magazines. It is irremarcably effective in social experiment. These teenagers don't even fight with their parents about what they can watch and listen to. At this point, they generally agree in certain films and shows that they are in a crescent of any of the TV shows, targeted that and beloved by so many of them, 14 of the TV shows. , it's fierce, fast, tough, illicity. You can hear the parents' voices. And after that, it's in their response. You feel really guilty walking away that you just , tell a perverted reminder, all this stuff. You're also gonna sick the fact that a boy is sleeping with his teacher and he's  15 years old. I mean, these people are supposed to be 15 and 16 years old. And if that was how my life was, I would be dead right now. You can feel this is ridiculous. Everybody with his jumping and bed with everyone out and all switching. I mean, by the little... series I was hearing through rumors that so and so were done with the teacher was now with this girl who was actually in depressants I mean  I have no idea what's going on. It's handy. We're just supposed to not use types up and back. What's so interesting about these girls is the odd mix, Christian and secular pop and bars. Despite the Christian schools, despite the carefully monitored TV viewing, they do not seem out of touch. They're not on hip and here is the most important thing that they would want you to know. They  being Christmas. This is what? People understand that we really enjoy this religion. The us as teenagers who are the ones who are out for have fun and whatever. If this is actually something that means something to us and that we are having fun doing it. Is it that an order? Some of them have taken more steps, perfectly measured steps, into the second world. Ruth and Jessica and Anna go to a public high school. And Anna is in the kids' school a hospital Christian. They say where Dan says. He was a teenager. He stays the attitude of the school was Christian and his your thing. That's fine Just so I'm just you don't push on other people Probably teenagers in the YouTube who weren't struggling the most out of their best and we were just a person in the second world He wanted to boys in the Joel I've had shared feelings Kissed in the public school and I just don't really  what I see until 13 Probably the most chocolate person It's morning. あ's all home school because he says she does the Christian schools only teach Christian values during Bible class she does they should be announced yet in all the subjects. So I was getting out more and more just this summer who spent three weeks waiting for the first time in his life and it was with non-Christmas and the soccer trip. I don't know I mean I learned a lot of stories and jokes and stuff they were all really nasty and unrupeatable. este凡是我的 stats.'' The boys are always , , talking about sex or things that have to do with sex. And , I mean, this age, I'm certain. Think about that, but still, I don't , ,  talking about it. A typical joke, the only one that I could drag out of him, without the boy, you grow having a period, correlated night, a policeman, and a pizza. Believe me, you don't want to know. It's just incredible. Being they were, it's just they were the most. And they didn't, . But he is literally at a loss for words. And then some of the guys, they just got a kick out of acting, they were gay or something. On the bus ride, they found out that an audience, they did the bus trip. Acting  they were , after me,  what I mean? They were , say stuff, and  kind of exaggerated. If eminence kind of accent, there was one guy who was , oh it's been getting mad, knock it off. He said, oh come on,  you wanted me. No, I don't. Up into this point you've been home sport. You haven't been around other kids. And so was this literally the first time this happened to you? Yes. Yes. Here without the other kids in the trip, Joe's family is much more fundamentalist today and incorporates the Bible in their lives. But if a benefit you get from that, kids' parents try to balance, secular and Christian and Muslims, all seem way more at ease in themselves. In the world. Thank you for watching. For the rest of the drive, the girls sing the Elapos song every few hours. They wrap it through the pages of teen people, we destroy it out loud to each other, cause the magazine and the vibes, flip it over and begin again. By the time we arrive in the rest of Virginia, this is the first accomplishment of trip. Everybody is memorized all the words. It's on the fly and on the edge, Chinese makes me sick. I'm the one who's smiling, girls don't pop up with the summer. These are the vessels that God has chosen to come here, it's all about the rest. I'll take your fire one way, see you soon. Back to the other most part of the earth. Everybody stays at an old 4-H camp that had been taken over by the press between Church and Americans National Missionary Organization, Mission to the World. Kittin' adults, mother of the country, built various cabins, Persian-held and campfire circle, whose green, shady, spectacularly, pretty. Daily sermons from patched. ex-marine and we call it past the penny. We've had people come up here. This is our sixth stuff. And every year someone come with the idea that we're going to win West Virginia over Jesus this week. I'm serious. Now this is true. I'm here to tell you that's not going to happen. Now go ahead. But if you will open your- Your heart, you got this weight, God will change your life and you will never be the sign. Right now there's a boom, church parking site this one, sent people on one to the commission trips. Spoon classes are denominations, there are no great national estimates, but in this one press between the nomination, that's the biggest one. The number of short-term missionaries, more than double, in just three years. Now it's a boom. 5,000 souls, 750 of them came to this West Virginia summer campus here, and the number is still climbing. And so, among certain groups of Christian teenagers, going on a mission script from a right of passage, their upbeat articles, ads and Christian team magazines. When the Chicago girls Anna says that of the 11 girls in her class at the road school, smocked Christian junior high, all 11 when her mission trips this summer. But when they got to where they were going, they often got a job to culture shop. The Chicago pants up, and scum caws small town, fixing up a house and a beautiful sleeping yard, apple trees, two porches. Further, a trailer homes up the street, this house was all in all, not with kids thought of, and they signed up to talk from the porchiness. On girls said that she had envisioned something more  green and green, a high-rise Chicago public housing project. Hello, one of his family is a fool, did this work? I didn't picture, I mean this house is a lot bigger than I thought, if I'd be  a one down below, shag. I mean, I didn't picture, . , rack a lot of, ? Rack, cause did you say? I don't know, , I don't know, dirt, why, but. But it's nice, I mean, you definitely need to pay it. The mechanism would be awkward for the recipients in this charity work. Nothing else, to have all the neighbors see team of out-of-state church kids working on their house. But as it turned out, the neighbors saw the kids and thought that perhaps they were from some kind of work-release boot camp kind of program. they saw them. to see date my quotes. How about my name? I'm a student. How about the phone line? Kebbo Kani Ham is 80 years old. She lives in the house that she got into this painting. Long to daughter, she's in the 50s, and a grand-done, can you? I really expect it for somebody  you whose family is always worth. Is it strange that these people come in and help your heart, this? -huh. It's saying very, it's nice. So we have no main comment. How? We got no men's helpers. This has to be a noun for us. But I would think that because you've always been a working family, or the notion of having people come in and help out in your charity. First time. Well, we love it. That's it. Because we need it, isn't it? Now, you worried having all these Bible kids come to you, that they'll be trying to preach to you the whole time. I'm a terrible doctor for the disease. A terrible doctor for the disease. Act 3. Why is the serpents and harmless staves? Back in Chicago, Dan said that prior to what brings everybody on the fifth post to God, it's facing hardship together. And as a consequence, difficult is piano first morning. You're gonna give me , the ambulance. You're gonna be sculling here. Girls sit on the porch of the cabin, venting constitution, crayons and people, trying to get well-carred to down, everybody on it. Girls are getting gay to rate. The end part of the hospital are in. Yeah, he's always there. They  Mamanee Barthine, Mamanee. Mamanee. Just do it. Just do it. And then you get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. Good, but that's  an renovation. Good, great. And then some sort of food. poisoning. When he goes into the hospital, it sends the four adult leaders in the floor, marching into a dispute of what to do next. Some of Dan's best-led plans began to go awry. Pick the vacation Bible school. The original plan for the week was that every morning for a few hours, kids were split into two different groups. Half of the work on painting the Cunningham's house, half would work on what they call, of DBS, which is Church Beat Court of Education Bible School. Which it tells us Church Beat Court, trying to bring the word of God, what kids, games, kids, and we, brief lessons. Every time you say, for the way you love, we're good or you feel can try on. Anna and Lauren, practice what we'll say at Roundup Kids. , do you have any kids? Should we ask them to take you to have any kids? , if you're interested, have them come. Yeah. But we've got bad advice about where to hold the big mission by the school. We set up a better 10 minute drive from the coming in his house, in the big empty public park. And as we went knocking, can go to door to advertise the event kids. Is' that... fairy tale. We're at each house. The person at the door was slightly more in front, slightly more elderly than the person at the house before. I am having children on their many grandchildren year. I don't know where my children are. Okay, thank you. I'm wondering if you had any kids that wanted to come to the backyard Bible Club at Werdington's house? Do you have any kids? Do you have any any of your money children? And the next day when we went out to hold the vacation Bible School. The crops and costumes and games, pre-rehears skit and more candy than you might imagine. Aaron Marie Jessica Nora Varac, Kelly and Arden sat on the edge of an outdoor stage in the car waiting. Nobody showed up. Closes the cams when white pick up turned into a parking area. Look at the child. Child. Child. Child. Look at the child. I'm a bear in the car. I'm a bear in the car. Oh, please. Maybe they have seven kids. They didn't even say seven. Created by Ian Oh wow. So we can make every day if nobody comes. This is going to be  three hours of waste this time. Every day. Two hours. One of the group leaders. Nora. God is in the ground. Yeah, I think that anyone who is led to price surprise, Chris, can you start us off and then Laura can you just finish? Thanks. I. They've out their heads. Here's one of the advantages of Christ United, and second one. But at any moment of trouble, and somebody might get frustrated and mad. Hopefully that matter, at any turning point in day, when one thing ends and another stuff again, our group takes quite a lot of requests. We're really hoping that we'd be able to teach some kids about God, but it didn't work out that way. And maybe you're just showing us better to go back to the house and work with the family there. Or please show us some more signs. See you later. much for this day and that was nice and I just I just pray that we won't be discouraged and no kids will come and that maybe well you said that everything is worked for the garden maybe we need more time on the house floor and I just pray that whatever happens that good things will come out of this and I'll do it for your glory Talking with the kids afterwards, I found that the lesson that they took from the 6th months was not that they could have chosen better location, done a better job finding kids. It was not that they could have tried hard. But they are told me simply was, because this was God's will. It's a lesson that seems to a secular person, strangely it odds with the job, reasoned children. It seems in fact to be exactly the opposite of what you would want to teach a child. These kids is after all. A process of convincing them that they have to be... response that is something goes wrong they have to figure out those anything they could come come have to dance about this the other about leaders down it finally the only person on the trip who says anything convincing about why this notion of God's will might be a good thing to teach seniors just root the oldest girl in the world that helps me for the day because you see kids who don't care at all  about Jesus and all that and they seem to be doing to spend they seem to be doing a lot better so because I'm in this really competitive program and a lot of the kids are not for shit and a lot of kids do really well one of my classmates I think scored a perfect on ACT and I didn't and I was I mean I wasn't very close and I made a big overview of my not point is that oh, they seem to be showing better and sometimes I think boy I wish that I could do that well and I guess it wasn't that's pretty funny and I needed to do that well seems  just knowing that it's not all under our control and that maybe that no God does have a plan. So whatever he chooses, though I mean that  it and I certainly don't  not coming out on top or not being the best. At Four you name this appointment. for it. One great thing about staying in a camp with 130 other Christians, if you're a young Christian girl who has never had a boyfriend, is he much better than in-school chance of meeting a nice, cute Christian boy. Of course, camp rules prohibit anyone having the pressure of my father. This turns out not to plant the style of the shaggherds from the scrubber. The pressure of my father is exactly as far as they can handle. Monday night after services and after devotions, everybody is milling around volleyball court and center. Your boys are... I'm one of the adult leaders in Nora. Come stand carrying a word game. What? A word? What? What? The more embarrassed. First you're in terms of, you're  anyone up for a game of mine, but let's see how smart you're down. This kids are staring at you. And I run it out of the other door. This is a laughing. Hey, she's a cheerfully described yourself as the most boy crazy. She explains that it was Anna. She just didn't care what anyone thought. You spoke up to say that she liked Bob. Which turned- that the master's book. It's the only end of time playing the follow game. , how did you work with my? ,  the world's in here. I'm a brand. How far? A lot of people are sharing. And the first of all, Lauren and Ruthy, they  to know, I mean, you need to offer this relationship. Then there is Andy, so, that's what I'm talking about. And then there's Ben who's really everyone's part. Not for the all-hats, they're for sure. But it feels  just good thing so for the camera to nod, I'll hit you, Doug. All right, yes, I'm just doing a good thing. Oh my God. During the game, a girl came over and studied rubbing pants shoulders. His little massage girlfriend from over. Oh, I'm sorry. He's , no, it's that. You get a little aggravated. Well, he did a little aggravated. You, are you WWE Team Team? Trend to Power inai. Mean OK, it's good. I won't remember himalnız. You does- What are you doing? make eye contact or talk? We did. First, it was eye contact. Hey, she asked me. And so first we were , we were playing body and not playing,  you find the words. And I was , oh, it's on the words. But I already found the word. I was on the chart. And so then as I began to tell me how we really stunk it, we get now basically. Not very romantic, wait. But after that, every night after the missionary one, Chicago girls shower, high lip costs, blow dry their hair straight. So they're ready for the final point. Joel, who has the most protective parents of anybody, is not indulging in precious demons, very far on this planet. This planet is way and all, some parents. They're kind of strict with the issue of, so , the knowledge of data, so we're dead. Seriously, I'm not worth the data, you think? I'm so good there. until they're dead. That is, too, I'm not allowed to date. They get their into this courtship idea where the family is, the both of the families you can get together, and then, the two people get to know each other when the family is setting, but not  going out , by ourselves, for our parents getting infected, so we can sit and talk, with our parents across the room or whatever, and it starts getting kind of farther and farther and continue to say goddaughter. So, as we get older and more responsible, more mature than , starts getting more one-on-one, as we get more responsible and go now at 16 and 6. Joseph says that he's going through a period of questioning his faith right now, and the most emotionally charged questions that he's asking have to do in sex. He got right bam, from Aridal Sex. What is the 13-year-old voice first of all? Joseph says that he's planning on reading all the biblical references on it, so we can understand the reason, and so you can see from itself. there's any wiggle room. He burrows his mom's theological books and hard subjects  this. What producers use in Burton Assen, he has a Bible verse that's a particular favorite. He goes to scrap paper from his mom. I'll get written down. I was a bit long-gave. So this is a little piece of paper cut out in circle. Is that your writing? No, that's my long-during period. Same time with me 22, 22. We also use a verse by pursue writing as a fate, love. He's with those who follow the word of the Pure Heart. Which basically is means for me stay away. What I want to do at this time. And sometime early in the week Susan and I met Matt Gurkins, there are Kylan, saw standing with her Chicago interviewies, holding our tape for quarters and boom mice, strobe right up. We're gonna, we're thinking we heard something in the woods there last night. I'm gonna get very investigating it. This is just weeks after the movie Blair Witch Project, it did, Matt is 18, Eric's 23, and it becomes clear after some questioning that in fact they have no intention of bringing things. They just said that, trying to get on radio. So what really gets on the radio? Yeah. or rather, do some  the magic to get on radio or you want real light. Ah. We explained that we're doing a documentary story, which means we tell them that you have a better chance of getting on the air, if you go through some sort of chain, but because of this weak mission rate. So we can find something that would really change our lives, doing a documentary, to broadcast the course of this, we call you back. Some of you have this week, a change your life, you find me and you'll be a mirror. We are. So  what we need to do is just check in with you every time. Let's know how progress happens. This is the same thing. What's with this change? Stop! We want to change! After that, as you can spend, we run into them every single day. And every single day, we hit so much disabled. That all changes in the world. Coming up, how we've been Eminem since Starburst can serve the Lord in a minute, and public radio international when our program continues. The American Life, my request, most weeks in a program with course which is a team, where you have a variety of different kinds of stories in that theme. Today we are devoting our entire show to just one story about a group of suburban Chicago teenagers. First... church mission trip, the West Virginia, fix up the housing family who needs help and witness from God. We arrived at 5 carshell at 5. The substance of things before. By Tuesday, dance feeling better. And one of the persons who does the work site is dropped in the neighbors. I'm Dan. It's a closure name again. Chris, this is Marissa. Hi. I didn't come out during the winter to see the past day back then, one of them, Crystal, said the month that Dam is bringing the group out, it's going to be the same as his birthday, and Dam came back to the pair. Are we a celebrate the birthday? So are you celebrating when we came here? Is that the exact migrates below the Mason Dixon, since it's fine? And we actually have a little press for you, because we know it's really a birthday. So one of the girls are not a little present. So, if you guys ever get bored and want to come over there, there's a bunch of people to be here all week. That's it. to talk to you, we got some candy and stuff, and then introduce yourself for now, and if you want to come out, we'll be in the last few times of wee much, I think, 12. 12, we got something to do with the stuff we got from candy and drinks. In fact next door, everybody works in the county and is house, scraping off the old paint, rolling on the new, trimming back bushes, climbing up ladders. Everybody dressed in surgical scrubs, there's blue green cotton pajamas that you see the doctor's mirror and you are, that is, you can paint for the eyes of the watchy brother, it would be sad if I had a third door. other doctor on their home. The record was quickly. At some point, did a slide some ancient pain Dr. Luminum cider. The adults drag in and industrial power washers. They weren't a kid about so frighteningly. Some get sort of spooked. I don't know. I'm pretty used with power and how I see you. I mean, kill somebody. I mean, seriously kill somebody. And he stands in line deciding she picked me. Ooh. I don't know what I see here. I'm just trying to find you. Let's power wash it gets going. Rude is the first one to use it to actually remove paint. It's fine, yeah. I don't know all this so I  the power. Among an earlier generation, Christyman. Or among more fundamentalist Christyman. There might be some question about whether it is woman's place to run power tools in family. This question is so irrelevant, this question. between teenagers. When I bring it up, they literally do not know what I'm talking about. While they all work on the house, every now and then, somebody from the climbing ham family spot. And every single time it is  the experience that you have when you spot a minor slept, your heart leaves, so all you can think about, and then you're brave enough to still over in chat. Try to play. , oh, we're just talking here. I'm a lot just  talking to anybody. After all, they are here to minister to the staff. From the cutting-edge and starter Angie comes out on the porch when afternoon, Kelly and Jess at the due to best be Franklin. After once, Kelly's mother might feel  she did the right thing by the daughter of her back street boys and dudes. Because now they get the chance to talk back street boys on the words we have. Following Crystal, Grossman, extor, whenever a back street boys poster, Angie in the 98th or. Angie's actually in the late 20s, she has a small disability in one of her arms, and she's shorter than the other, and her handle more musically functional. Most days she stays in calm, watching TV. It is inherently difficult for the Chicago teenagers to figure out how to interact with, even how to react to it, somebody from such a different background, and there's a certain amount of raw confusion to the field-are-way forward. Every night back to the camp, if your prayer is in versionals, they ought to breathe in that day. So anyone have. I thought, , at first is kind of hard to touch baby. Because I mean, I didn't  stirring. I don't want to. And it's not just because of her. I was because it hard to understand her and I mean, she didn't really get what you said sometimes. But, and at first I was kind of doing it at a pretty forehead. And then that didn't feel right, , I don't want to do it. the people her and I don't know, it's wrong or right throughout the day. But I've called doing it and I don't know if that's right and I just, and it makes me so happy when I see this smile and I guess I don't know if I'd  to do that. This is what Jesus does. The remedy does for him. Until later, when dance is the perfect thing, that when Jesus walked here, he didn't feel pity. I think that's a good thing. But the passion. And the thing. Why are there not for this happens? She obviously has  a lot of problems with her deformity. Whatever. There actually can't be an having she's having a main deformity. And we can reach her that way just, , sure. Over and over, Dan tells the group that their main purpose in coming to Western Junior is the minister to the family who's house to work in art. Getting snow Angie's importance. Remember the names? I know I needed  the new college girl. What was the name you got? Really they. I thought it was great. You guys, they were showing your boy fan. I thought that was great. , and they say they go to that show. I asked with them, you two prevent them. They said they've done a couple of youth group events. So I said, , if the time you tried, I think you have a good opportunity to just ask them. Well, , what do you think about God? What? I mean, I don't think it would be awkward at all. I just think I would encourage you and be crying about it at a fixed level, after hearing a little sorry. The motivation is there right? Man, just plan to sleep, just see what happens, and maybe you're going to go with it. Listening to all this, I imagine how to stir up the managing personal problem I think. They overheard all this eating and probably different. And they're pointed to you, as well. They're interaction with the Chicago girls is as simple as they seem sort of cool. They  it. But missionary work is at some level  any sales work. There's no way to do it. You've got to discuss things, some sort of sales strategy. All these evenings. and with prayer, to reach anybody who wants to say something, so to speak up. And a lot of the person about Angie and to neighbors, Chris Malpala, Kelly was among those operant. I just pray that tomorrow we really get to talk to, this is coming here and , , and just really, it will be a witness for you Lord. I especially pray for Angela. I'm just help us to ask the right questions to think of things to say and talk about when until he Far East, hacer yaWith names, be but makes sense to get inside or makes her special. Okay, Frank, in the blood that, so this really gets  us that, we won't be  the other group and that we'll just really get as a really good friend. And then everybody headed to the volleyball court, where I'm sorry to report, Chicago and Zloss. Lauren's second-served one straight to the guy she stood ahead of pressure. And he's spiked it he didn't even know. Jesus. Come on, Dean. We're here. Yes. We're here. Susan meanwhile is watching the volleyball game from the sidelines. When there's two guys, Matt and Eric, we want to be on the radio. Show it up. All right. The game is getting very exciting at this point. Yeah, what do you guys need right through us the game for me? All right. Okay. It has been a terrible long-to-up. All returned to Chicago, too. Hey, Chicago, return with a fight over the next. It is returned and it is all. I have to go ahead and turn it Oh, I'm a nice actor Afterwards naturally the insist that guess what this is change now this game just now has made us appreciate I'm really going even though I want to go to the American volleyball team I'm gonna be the old fish or Spike Even ended the way every other evening did on the trip and happens public who sang that Salad and then one other song. When I say, I That's before I say, how me why? Tell me why! I'm just gonna find you! Tell me why! Exxxx, do you have any things not seen? Well if anybody goes around here that can get candy, you let it know. We'll get them calm. This is damn. trying to attract kids to vacation Bible school literally by walking down the street and passing out and pulls and which turns out to be surprisingly effective. Is this your brother? You got some tan too, Christopher? Actual. The idea is give up on that first location and nobody showed up on the front. Just do it around the corner from the house to the finish. And what points the whole deal? The two teenage girls from next door, Crystal Apollo, took them and just started with kids from door to door, rounding up the process. doesn't pitch it up from the same one. The games, the sharp painting, and the rest from the Bible, it's ended in form of the skip. So let's everyone close it as we're gonna pray. God, we thank you for the stay. We thank you for everyone that made it here. Great, we could have fun time now, we can learn from your skip, and then we could also enjoy doing our craft and playing some more games and having this, your precious, how would you all further do the one? I hope I have a school turns out to be really fun but the Western junior kids and Chicago ones too. Games to work with great. the price of Zurgab and then some of the kids clearly have hard lives and are excited at all the attention again. The only thing lacking is non-believers. And we all the kids say they got a church when it comes time to make beaded faith bracelets, they already know what up beats stand for it. During dance harmless, most of the kids know Bible stories themselves. You guys know the story about the Red Sea, right? Well, here's a good story about the Red Sea, right? Right, tap water, what happened? Later, we're hearing the reasoning, grass, and Bible standing. When Angie and Chris go this walk right up to her. It's pretty much a situation in any missionary where we go our desired deal. And having the choice is if the greater plant is in fact work, the child runs get down and the child's pro-work, talking to her from reaching. Chris will go some of the get her viable. One of the adult leaders, Harold is most of the talking, which has to be telling the reason, at the end. Please call her, have a Bible too. Yes, you're right. Yeah. So that's interesting when I used to go this way, by the way. Is it  I really just saw your story? Is it a religious story? Did they talk about that at school? No. No. Did you see my baby? It was kind of cool off. There was a Chinese boy's school, gave a asylum, and he told me, did I look  that? Doing breaks. All the girls chat happily with their good kids. Later, back to camp. They could graduate from home. You got so well fed. So probably you probably got to work. All of this. to really saw them during the fall of Crystal. Thank you so much. Let's keep that up, smile. This is great. I would say that of all the people, including all the VDS, kids that we've had. The most seeds that we've been plants have been with those girls. We've been to help them on the strip. You've stayed with me. they would make a step toward having things in the ending, and it's talking. This would probably happen to service in the open of this, probably by being forced for articulating face damage. And it would happen by facing hardship in the future, and turning to God to help with difficult things. But the fact is the hardships on the fifth and that would be not very hard at all. Most of them only had to articulate their faith, six year olds, who'd mostly already accept the Jesus in the heart. This was not enough, not around the soul searching for. Instead, we're going to do it. the kids who didn't doubt their faith in Him, didn't doubt their ego. And the kids who had all sorts of questions in Him, they didn't you to know that those questions on the mission trip. Do you need you with the most doubtfuls, or are you the most you kept your doubts personal? Which is really, it's frustrating, it's hard, , to be wanting to be part of the group and being part of the group and yet knowing that in some way you're not part of the group because you questioned what to do with this about. Why didn't hold the special symbol at the place in the church? So it's the first baby born to young congregation in the years ago. Whenever the kids and church fall in the round at Hock Church Youth groups, Arden's always present. But about a year ago, even this carefully raised girl started to grapple with doubt. And her doubt began, not because of some of the chisel and television. Not because of peer pressure, from attractive, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, pornographic website using fans of the South Parking. And then her doubt began to church me. She was there for six weeks, and a program called Discipe. training. We sent her and five girls she'd never met before. Into the woods for two weeks, camping, hiking, and new age. And we were really tight. I mean we just needed everything together. We'd praise you, sing songs together at night. And when we get lost, I mean the first thing we do to have the same frame, we got to , spirit, or at midnight. It's time for, I mean we were just really, I mean it was a wonderful experience. I had a lot of fun. And if you're to describe your friends, so we could use work for, ourselves. I was in the first. He was incredibly real. I felt  he was there. That was the only way I could describe it. He was really there. After two weeks, I had to invite my friends. He meant me to it. We joined the rest of the year. My friends suddenly changed. who I thought they were. They suddenly became different. And I don't think I think it was just that I hadn't seen them with other people. Besides I grew. , they were. , they were just pop. I was still hoping to have that friendship among five of us and I thought I was going to be that, , I just couldn't make it and then I sort of dropped on my spiritual role. And so I started having trouble praying,  I didn't want praying, and I was starting to go, well, , what's up with this? What is REF- feel, if I can't even, when I feel  that's there and then I said, but he's not, we're gonna see this whole time, ? So that's when I really started to question, , and I had always doubted, I thought, , God wasn't any year near me at all, and he did care. One of the traditions in Christianity is a great faith, often comes only after great doubt. The new test begins. of one story after another  this, even Jesus grapples with his conscience in the desert for he begins his music, he prays again and gets semif. Listen to Arden, I begin to wonder if all new beliefs have to go through that pile of the desert themselves, we're gonna arrive at a mature family. This is what damn, remember the parents of the Christianity, it's part of these teenagers lives as they grow old, but it is enormously difficult to go through this time down. It makes Arden unhappy. She says she does not want. and I think I wanted another big spiritual moment, feeling close to God and she had no wood. I don't trust that anymore, I don't trust you, , just your emotions and where they may take you. And at the same time, she knows that without a story we could pay for, she's nowhere. That's the thing that worries me the most, this meant, , I may never find what I'm looking for, I may never find out who God is and that worries me with, I sometimes think. Oh my God,  this. I don't know where I was the, I guess, I don't know. I didn't start all over again. Abraham our father answered his in any, when the Lord commanded him to offer up his son. He took the wood and fire and journeyed to Mariah. And there he built an altar to complete what he'd begun. Pastor Kennedy actually built into song during the sermonary's day. Subjected determined was how the world caused certain people of certain. How when does they usually do not want to go? We had a story of Abraham in Carthus Light Eisen. Moses, we wanted to go to Pharaoh. Can he talk to the heart about the moment he thought he was called to preach? And then he asked all of us to listen to our own hearts. Has God been speaking to us during our week in West Virginia? Maybe God is speaking to you. You want to be a miss? Now, over here, I'm going to go to a legal page. You think God calling you to serve me? Maybe that's what God wants you to. I'm going to leave this page out here, and I want you to just come but you're named. I'm not going to tell your name that he's listed. I'm going to turn it into the world. This is the tweet I think you need to do that. You need to make that. to admit, if God is calling me after it's service ends, he people know now. Because the teenage is a lot of problems. Except God who walks over to the league. He's a lot of people. Yeah. Catch up on the street. So I saw it in this place. Yes. It was for me to me, it's the most powerful in the world. I saw it in the name of God. what he wants to do with his life. But the parts of this thing clearly stopped chasing him, and there was always saying how hard it is from the top. There was still us a long way to go, but he's actually dead. He's in a bigger sector world. He's the one member of the nuclear he decided that once he had out into that world, as a mission, each in the country. You mean, K. was a friend, just , man, working, thinking all these years. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry to play it. It's totally out now. If that were you thought up in turn that phone? Yeah, it is. Given how I'm strict. How do you want to take this amount of light? Given how I'm stricted with them, you can see why you might jump the chance to go overseas. You can wear it. Yeah, some of the rules I can understand why I accept it, because it's  a good idea. It is getting kind of restricted now that I'm getting older. Next up, May Distumbled, this is me. A week I kept running into this guy I wanted to do in radio, Matt Mehran. And on the last morning in West Virginia, I see Eric out by his palm. Night before he had driven some kids from his VDS back home in the near. Eric's group was running his field for vacation by the same time. It's called the Indian Park. The top section of Fairmoms, and every got close to a lot of things. He has really hard days, night. They can come home. Some car was coming to close. He tried to go home. Dr. Nandarin was scared. When it came to left, it was  at the park and he was all afraid that it was stolen. And stuff  that. And while we're going in there,  keep your head low because there's bullets and stuff. It's really hard to think of these little that's the fort. It was  happy deal with stuff, and then we did that. And we gave up prizes on the last day and we did that alone home. So that is where the surprises are. So that's where I'm living. So this was me. That's what I think I'm almost almost  kind of down on the whole idea of VBS because it's you've invested in this case for a week, , they get close and , and the resistance of development is  cut off. So I just have  a notion if this is... hard on the nice and unreal struck in that world. Early early in the week we were checking about  you guys were going to change with the end but you did systemally had some trouble. Oh definitely I mean definitely because I was really hard I was very broken up by the thought of what it's right to do this one of the video I was going to invest in this case just to learn how to believe in it. At the end of there we, the Chicagoans are doing proud of how far they come to the vacation Bible school, the Dangeen, Paul and Crystal. They invited the dinner out of the campsite in the last night. People promised to write to each other. When we asked Crystal which parts of the Bible she could achieve in reading, got a caroled on that subject's phone. She can't remember which something's going to go. It's said, since she doesn't really read anything on the wrong one. Services at last night. kids in these past get up from some song. They're in a band called Iris, and the songs that one unique burdens in the nation and the Christian. So, oh, I'd  to encourage you all to not let it stop here, but when you go back, if you have friends with family that you can witness to continue to share the love of Christ with people. I get so self-sure, you never think you can fight I'm my beliefs so what's it? I would not try to hide I'm not trying to push you, but I hate seeing  this I love you too much, the left you dying rigorous You're on a ledge in the ground in the evening, breaking You try to swim, you're singing so slowly, grab his hand Hey friends, I won't knock a gun on my hand Hey friends, what can I do to make you understand? To make you understand! That's what the Chicago kids about to the task of actually fossilitizing non-trusting friends. They do not seem either or ready. It's one thing to befriend strangers in another state. It's another kind of commitment to their faith, by the palm. It's a sacrifice. And the Hong Kong I've found, Joe, a commissioner, says he doesn't think it'll happen. It is people who want to come. or at least as far as I can insert out, , I'm still nervous to ask. And I already and I already and I already and I also would use the case most of my numbers. Very known. They don't, they, they, they, they're fine. You can be in Christian, mean, but they, they don't have any English citizens. Really, is that possible? In the poem I'm going to sense the trip, only one member of the squadron on Christian parent to move through. As your contact, crystal and pollen and an engine, an adult leader goes to the engine and sends a viable clear sign that has been locked in. Maybe this lack of proselytizing energy is not such a bad thing. The Dan is going to stick to his goal from the trip, helping the kids examine what they believe. The real test day, most people are not usually in interaction. with people, friends, with miles, when, or with people to try and convert. Real tested that happened with people causing students. Parents, friends. It was a bunch of Christians who made art in question, then. The desire to kiss a nice Christian girl that made joke, whilst we're here's those questions right from the continued.
