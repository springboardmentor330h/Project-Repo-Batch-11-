I've rarely daydreamed of befriending my rock idols, maybe it has attention with my cranks.

My musical heroes are mostly not weirdos who didn't become things because of their social grace, just because I have them in my heart. that mean I want them in my life. So the very idea of spending five whole days who've definitely made making guitar workshops for moldy rock big shots and paying upwards to read thousand bucks to do it at something called Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp isn't my fantasy crime I worked tonight here. My Rockwell fancies, you get those lessons from my planner and Leslie West and Felix Cavalier. Hopefully you had no idea these people are. And you never did at the year 1970-75 our underrepresented in your record collection in both the chronological and spiritual sense.

My fantasy for this camp would be to have Mills Lock and teach me a few tricks. I heard it was on the issue. and open G. I guess I would compare my voice to that of  Lou Gramma forna. Where is right there? And who are these rock and roll fans whose dreams could inspire conception across the role is so different from my own. Joe, who marked sound equipment in Detroit, Connie and Maxine, sisters from Minneapolis who left their husbands and kids back home, and Rob, and that teacher from Long Island who heard about camp on Howard's experience radio show. I love things. I  things people. I love to see me things people. This is I never think of anything. That's Neil Blaster's guitar workshop. Probably the most low key sensible seminar of me. He's a crying respectful man. Even though he knows when he's doing, he doesn't get out He pumps out a chug-a-log rhythm, advising his students to try to stay in the back pocket of the beat into state- grummer, real rhythmic. Watching them were too long, doesn't look  any fan of CI or iPad. When almost be boring, except that watching nervous people in any given situation is always at least slightly engaged. And also, as the only girl in the room, I keep cracking up watching an arrangement of men sitting in a circle stroking your instruments. Braves comes to mind when I'm not sure I can say on radio. It includes the word, sure. You'll have to learn these with prayers and then the last time I'm angry. So, what's the response? , you'll have to learn  amazing lines. When Locker mentioned scale, it seems  everyone can play the Go-Reilly one, but no one knows the blue scale, he plays the most basic downwards viral imagine. Seems  something you should be paying canny down to get car shacks in bucks to teach their experiences. Some of the other things bookching with the screen, sometimes they are not funny, it is not the most cool, I have several of them. instead of bothering the man who pinch hits for Bruce Springsteek kneel down. Losson informs the class he's going to take a solo and they should try and keep the rhythm strong for me. Good luck! What's apparent isn't so much the gating difference between skill or the lack of it, but rather the chasm between confidence and self doubt. Losson plays tough, spare rips and looks so much, as it's cool. Meanwhile, all the campers around him are having their feet  their marks. watching off to the front lines and all their eyes are fixed on their feet, trying not to screw up. This seems  a good moment to pause and talk about what is and isn't rock and roll. As it believes her in the anyone can do it all or nothing at all if it could pop rock and think real music is not about technique or virtuosity or knowing your skills. It's about believing in what you have to say and wanting to... say it so badly that you'll scream your guts out of that's what it takes to get people to list. Later on when an asked blocker in committee wanted an amphitheater at real power, or anything to say, the answer was gracious, diplomatic. I heard a lot of music and every gruddy. Over the course of the camp, also it's nearly a dozen such seminars and it becomes clean fully obvious that rock and roll and high school is a lot  real high school. Subject matter doesn't matter as much as the personality. the teacher. Everyone wants to be locked up, but Rick Daringer leads his car session the nitpick who takes points off for bad hinged sheep. Yes, Daringer is the only instructor who actually contended after showing off for a while she proceeds to spend nearly 10 whole minutes. spreading crackpot ideas such as if this played important So, please, please, you can't imagine anyone I admire talking sweet. He is literally holding up a pen of furniture polish  doing a TV commercial. Good heat Richards display a spray bottle of 4.09 with Neil Young asked to discuss his craft even his the word cleanliness. приз And the thing is, well, I was gagging it, and here in your stoking is most of the campers found him hilarious. In fact, these people sat through their workshops and jam sessions and lunch for phase with these serene smiles. And watching them, I got jealous. To me, music has always been an ideological battleground where you hate, hate your enemies, and save your friends. To them, music seems  this I'm complicated part of their lives. It's simply making them... happy. So I'm just here for fun and to have some fun and to get some disclosure to some of the instruments. I really just  the music. So for me the problem with hanging around the campers was this. They were so gosh darn nice to meet Eve. My job as a grumpy commentator would have been a lot easier to stomach if they'd been self satisfied yet than I'd come to make fun of. But they had a ruined my fun by being so white to go. You can even mother Peter Frampton insult under my breath without feeling guilty. And  here in some kind of parallel universe when the most punk rock person there is the reporter from Forbes. The campers came all this way and paid all this money. It's their dream to meet these rockers. stars. So when they finally get to hang out and think, what did they talk about? What's at the heart of their two? I cornered Joe, he'd be Tarys from Detroit, one night after dinner. So Joe, when I was falling back up to the hotel, I saw you getting out of a limo. So I went to travel. And who's limo, where are you traveling in? That was with Rick Darenjur, and also Lou Graham. You went out to dinner? Yeah, we're out to dinner, I glory as the five's restaurant. And so, well, well, let's go. that  have you dinner with those guys? They are so so congenial. We had a sing along in a car. We were doing some foreign or songs and we were doing hang out, sleepy and there was a lot of power and a little kids all joined into the kind of a group. The wives, kids, those guys. Hang on, sleep. I would admit I loved that song. She came in handy from a sandwich. She sent their and her plate on a million years ago. She saw Dan's in the car. She was constant, gentle. and one night all the campers gathered on stage with the department there in your singing lead sparking one of the rare moments when the music they made together felt real sounded exciting them HQ They kind of excitement didn't last. For every second of participatory, palatable noise, there were three hours of rock star wars stories. , gave myself headaches from rolling my eyes, the campers eat these anecdotes up, egging on people , gorgeous bobby mayo, filled their hands with behind the scenes, insights into cramped and comes alive. And now they have the pair of limerite note. for yet he knows. We got together as a group, and January of that year, soon but you started forward to the local field. She's a great guy, I don't know what's going on. So that was a little done as an opening. I really  that about that. I think that's why I'm sorry. And he thinks listening to these tall tells me once was boring, tried twice, on the campus day, all my love of each one. show that. Every time he opened his mouth with a defamation of the Beach Boys greatness, he insulted his audience by telling the same stories at his after new lecture and he did on stage the very same night. Here's the afternoon. I was in India, a part of the one-bugle army that we step conversations of crew, I had started with the girls and all right, you gotta take more care and put your album program stage. He was the master and the shot and said전맹. You say  this, keep more attention in all of those. This is the guy who said that. That's what he said. Afternoon. So, since I've reached the SBA, I've got all the statues, they're more attention. It's the opposite. Which is a cliché, right there. Easy. This is a plot, but I was looking at the... The... The...

And Hitten, sitting there watching him freaking all those no doubt in pants, Brock, Stark, Hall, Pails with such obvious bluishness  watching new pants being bored.

I bet Joe from Detroit's going to be telling his blue gram limo story for at least as long as my love. been dizzy palm of hearty. And I actually found this kind of reassuring. Once it camp ended, I could go back to my beloved punk email content. My nightmare was over the minute I boarded to plain home, but I knew that for the spouses and children and co-workers of the campers, the nightmare had just begun.

And beat I can, sir about. What song do you  to draw in radio? Well, there are songs that I played in my hotel room every night during the camp. To remind me of my ideal, the thing I've worked in for. The six songs, from Spile of Anxiety, your age, the songs called Word and Car. What's a beat-type? What's a beat-type? What's a beat-type?

They want them out. We were just around here and we'll do one thing to get them out. Everyone was upset. They had been since these people who did two weeks. Sam Lawson said there was no reason we had to put up with this. He said these people were brings. We called the guard. They're just guard. They're just guard. They're just guard. And there's no reason a guard reached  that. He's got to intimidate these people because they think they're defense. And even Reverend James have a high word to say about this. they are close to the eight. And it is a Juan. In meditation. and that's what's all about. Get him on. They don't belong here, we don't want him. They're strange, they go. You get there, and just a little bit, you heard that you want to. And that's what I'm not as honest. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
