  "text": "It wasn't a moment on this screenhouse. It was a moment. It wasn't what you usually think of as it was. Picture, I think the people would be at a 10-story building, Rome style, and we'd better go with the city. We were supposed to come for a four-day visit, and it turned into a two-week visit, and  a month visit, and then we lived here. So I never really got to go back and say, why am I friends or anything? And I was really mad at my mother for doing that to me, on table stuff, and I was just really mad at everybody. and get here at all. With the move, it's an experiment communal living that's going on for 25 years, which I don't know. No one owns private property that we've been sharing, TVs, cars, everything. If you need pocket change, you'll go to a room called the Money Office. If that cash, you'll give it to you. Remember, this is five and two people. And while this is starting to sound  a big socialist collective in the middle of 1990s, the El Conservative meal, the girl meal, everything America. Let me add one more fact to make this picture complete. This community, it's Christian. When by a group called Jesus' People USA. All I did was sit up in my room and just stare at the window. I did not come down to eat or anything. And it's sat there and stared at the window. I thought it was so angry. But I was just killed anybody and bothered me. And I did that for  the first few days,  the first three days. Now it's 16, you're in a half after they moved here. Man says she doesn't think it herself is a Christian in the morning. Which understandably if such a mother, who moved here partly so many and who lived in the Christian fire and who ain't Christian values. So, that's the sense between me. , I was in charge of making a union or something. Then all that day she asked her questions, she said, I just can't think right now I can't actually go into hell and hunt. I was stuck. , so I just, I think she's  concerned about me, but she's just gonna have to live with her. Though the setting of this story is fairly exotic, this I would argue is not an usual American story. How many of her parents look to some new place, some dream house, some vision of a new life, somewhere else, moving the family with them. helping woodwork out for the kids. In the last half of this century, the American families of settled new suburbs, families migrated as a layoffs and the horses, what story could be more common? An orphaned works have come, the man does the exception of Jesus' people, most of the teenagers living there, they  it a lot, sales. And  any good parent, a man does my own consult with a man, about the move. I mean, to even agree to move. That's one thing I really get angry with is that I don't feel  I can make my own choices a lot of times, but that's what happens when you're in 16, I guess. Once I come out, it's just a new teenager and I'm , yeah, it stinks! Welcome to the B.E.E.S. How to go in public radio and international with the American live in my request. Each week in our program we choose some theme, and quite a variety of writers, performers, and documentary producers to tackle that theme. Today's show, Dreamhouse. Stories about parents who had some utopia in addition to the family's future, and who built their dreamhouses to try and realize their future. At one, meme is adventure, the family dreams of life in rural Maine. moved there from the city and there. Well, things started to get complicated. Act 2, Blue Sky Dream, a few David Beer is explains the gorgeous modern vision that drew his parents in tens of thousands of other young families to California in the 1950s and 60s working in aerosols. And what happened in the new life? Stay with us. at one. In 1976, Memos Pedola's parents decided to move from the upper west side of Manhattan, where the father was a math teacher out of the city, thought a house in name. It turned out to be a pivotal and redefining change in all of their lives. Mima prepared this story about her family's mother, it's partly the story of her parents' dreams. And partly the story of her. I don't have to guess in my parents' dreams for our family when they moved us from New York City to the main. They wrote it all down in a book. My mother actually wrote... entire children's story, 83 pages long, my dad did the illustrations and I picked a title, Mima's Adventures, I was six. Chapter 1 of Mima's Adventures, Aphome. Mima lived in New York City where apartment was on the 13th floor of a great tall building on the Wendy's corner in all of the city. In the spring, when she wrote this, the winter before we left, my mom was getting her master's degree in education. She thought that our move raised some interesting questions about early child to develop. how do you help children deal with the consequences of their parents' decisions? Mom writes in the introduction, in thinking how best to prepare my children and indeed my husband and myself, I came upon the idea of creating a story that we might when the move comes, actually reenact. Okay, chapter 4, coming to the mountain. The day the green pickup truck finished, its long drive, was sunny, cool, and breezy. The sun was setting rapidly behind the pond and over the mountains. Mommy and Daddy hoped to arrive just at this time and no later so they could unload the truck and settle themselves nicely before dark. Of course there was no houseguard. It was raining when we arrived. There were the air was thick with mosquitoes. The grass was about three feet high. The soaking wet and the truck got stuck as soon as we pulled off the road. That's my dad with a real beginning to our adventure in Maine. It was really history and that got this started. For seven years he'd been working as an administrator and teacher or private school in New York. He didn't want to do that anymore. He was living the wrong life. He envisioned a homestead in the country with farm animals, gardens, maybe a windmill, perfectly self-sustained and efficient. I had this sense that I wanted to do something in my life that was that I had more to stop. I was feeling  I wanted to work on something that felt more  this mine. And I suppose I really wanted to build something. Well, so very enhanced on experience, build it. Well, Dad said we could build a house. So of course, again, coming from part 2 of me, build a house. I just thought that meant, ,  a wildest thing I could think of was kind of  a suburban house. to know where you come in with a key and the toilets are there, the water is set up, but plumbing, the lights, heat, you never imagined. I never occurred to me. It didn't occur to me. And I don't think that occurred to that to mention to me, well, that means you have to do the well, we have to deal with the electricity. It didn't occur. Her dream of our life in means this. She'd bake bread, put up. preserve spraised of kids. My mom was a nice Jewish girl from the Bronx. Her it's  a great idea. And it didn't seem far fetched. Dad was a country boy. His father had built their house. He grown up with pigs and chickens and rural Rhode Island. But let's make this clear. Here was his plan. We'd live in a tent while he built a house from scratch completely by himself on a raw piece of land on a mountain in the middle of me in the one summer. So that was the plan. And it didn't seem crazy, Tom. We were very clear that it was an adventure in that. Some people envy us. We actually thought everybody had me. Did we ever think anybody thought we were a nutty? No, we never did. But we thought people envy us. Very, this whole thing was very. Just no concept of how alive's which changed it all. Our lives didn't just change. For me, it's the beginning of everything. That's who I am, of who my son. days today. Four years into the project the house wasn't finished and my parents were simply my mother moved out my younger brother Amelia when I stayed in the house with dad 21 years later my mother brother and I live in cities as far from rural living as you can get my father's remarried and the last one was living in the house it still was unfinished. ons Well, first of all, we could do these people. I'm looking at Dad with a mustache and a meleo as a... Just a three-old, four-year-old in a cell. Is that me? That's you. That's you. Wow. It's... Wow. I'm sorry to keep saying, wow, but this truth is I could do these people. I love your photos. with my mom, or for some or me. You see, so optimistic and playful in these pictures, our family before the fall, mom and dad are young, good-looking, working on building site together. Amelia and I, breakfast outside the tent, and help him or now, there's one of us posing proudly in front of our house. I remember one time, it was great time when I was working on and cutting the swath through the brush to make put the road in, and it was raining, and had been raining, raining's days. and things have got pretty muddy. And you kids were completely naked, and you were sliding around at the mud, covered with mud. And I had wanted somebody to come up to look at the hospital doing a foundation for us. And he hadn't do a drive, just as you kids can sliding down through the mud. He driven as far as he could up in the truck and got out the walk. And so he was confronted first with a wet muddy little kids screaming and laughing and running past the dump path. And I came out, yeah, and I came out wearing shorts and no shirt holding my machete and covered with  little bits of leaves because  when I'd be chopping the example of the machete leaves would be flying all over the place and I was wet so they were stuck in the y'all of my body and my face I had little piece of weeds all over the place and that's a little little scarier. I couldn't have been happier. If Daz Dream was to have a project of his own, I had my own six-year-old dream, Little House on the Prairie, and I'm not talking about the horrible TV series. I mean the books that Laura Ingles filed a road about profoundly experienced at moving west, building a home, and surviving blizzard sprouts, moloting wolves, and illnesses. In New York, I've been obsessed with a little house books, would act out scenes from friends, and may and I could play Laura every day. I saw everything through the filter of the little house books, I put blueberries up on the mountain and the mom would make a batch of pancakes or some carbs so dad would cut two by fours from the house and I'd stand by and have the nails. I felt  I had arrived. Okay so in my in my mythology of I was somewhere in December of 1976 it was  you were you were pop, Laura's pop and I was Laura and it was  you were you were being a pioneer man. You were a big hero and I was  the... I was the little halberd. That's what I felt . So, that's not that far. So, I think a lot of people thought these big heroes were suffering in New York City, but it was a sort of... And I was probably wondering if I didn't think I was here or I was still the anxiety and I was telling them about that. I realized that I was going to undertake a three-year-in-post cast. Yes. When I was writing, name is Ventures, it was before we did it. So the time frame is totally wacky and unrealistic. Chapter 6, Moving It. Lima Openedize Outside the tenth birthday. birds were singing their cheery morning wake-up songs while inside the tent, neem a lace snuggled in her sleeping bag. She was thinking about the day ahead. Today they were finally moved into the new house. The morning was cool and sunny with summer in its last days mean. Soon, it's been. In fact, when summer was in its last days we had a room in the ground. There was no floor, no walls, no roof, no house. When I look back now, I think the more. with the ominous music starts. It's here. Do you remember not to bring up sad stuff? Did you remember Jamie? The puppy? Yeah. We made it when I ran over. You're sleeping in the truck. It started it off and you didn't wake up and I didn't know you was there. It felt pretty bad about it. It just seemed  this was  the first tragedy of something. It was , yeah. something that seemed so nice had gone very wrong. Yeah. It feels bad for me. This is from Chapter 7 at home again. Winter evenings in the new house will cozy and warm. Mommy and Daddy had finished building the stone fireplace, so now after dinner every night they all settled in the living room. The warmth in color is quite... and relaxed. It's right in reality when the first snow came on October 3rd, we were still living in the tent, and believed me there was nothing cozy about it. The only thing we could do was set up camp in the youngthinished house. There were no windows. There were window openings cut, no windows. And the open was covered plastic. The third wall was plastic, right? Oh, that's right. That's right. The un-un-self-side. Not a very secure house. impossible to see. It was just a shell, really. And it already had started to smell. And I got kind of concerned because we were going to sleep immediately after dinner and all of us were in hats and gloves and coats and scarves. I felt  we were hibernating. Mom said something about feeling   she would come home from work and we would all  eat and then we were all dressed in our coats and our hats and... and you just get to bed and let's say we were hyphenating. Oh, I don't remember. I don't remember. I asked the wrong number. I would drive home for work and through TMD and on the way home to them. And I would see the lights, , , worklock for 30 minutes and lights would start coming out in the houses and I would just... So it felt  I was out of dickings or something. , oh, a house. A real home. And it started getting cold. And when we decided, well, really, mom pushed this, why? That we should not go on further without getting another place from the end. I just thought, it's really important. I think that we find a place where we can have a cabin really have. Warm from light. It didn't need to be necessarily electric stuff, but it closed up off. You, that's what we love to ask. Well, at that point, trying to felt  it was being a little bit of a lot to ask. It was impossible to stay. We moved out of the house to a small summer cabin a few miles away. The pipes there were frozen, so there was no running water. A word now about where this adventure took place. Sears Montman, population 500. You've never heard of it. You didn't go to camp there. Don't think LL being in a bunk for a large scrap of my quilt. Don't skip to my ramp, can you! And my dad's plan in the middle of this was to do everything himself. At one point, he spent a week in the bottom of a 30 foot hole that a pickaxe trying to dig a well. We didn't have electricity or a phone, then. Nothing can come as you hear. Sometimes when people go after a dream  this, they make an innocent decision for innocent reasons that has profound consequences. I wanted a view. And I just thought, well, I just didn't understand what difference it would make. But I think everyone was a might surprise that we built right up the far and the spot up on the hill, , this really way up. And that was where Dad fit right into everything else those fantasies. This is a great idea. Sure, we can build up there. Let me explain because this might not seem  a big deal. A few means back to the road, which in our case was back to the road, passed the field up through the brushing trees on the side of the mountain, which means open. really long drive-day. And when I see driveway, it doesn't exactly capture these. There should be another word for what this was. During the winter, when in the early one I would get home from school, the sun would be setting, and we struggle up to the house and get food snow. My parents couldn't get the cars up, so they'd walk up and down, carrying supplies and groceries on the sled. Once it was told we guys stover and we could barely walk them down. Apart from the driveway, we literally took all our lives and means. And I remember once, and this was straight out of us. the Arctic expedition, laid at night, and the only one I was so tired and trying to line the snow games to rest. My dad pulled on our arms and yelled at us to get up and freeze to go. We all had to deal with that time, but it was the worst thing to do. There was one particular day when it snowed, and I really , something came over, dad, it was  this battle with nature, and that he was going to win, and he did. He started at the top. He must have been snowed in at the top. He started to shovel all the way down. And it took him hours and hours. And hours, of course, was still snowing. And it was very difficult to reason with him of, to let's not get your tracks are being totally covered. This is kind of a blizzard, it's really. And by the time. He got, I don't think he ever quite got to bottom. He was just exhausted, wiped out and he was dark. And then, , he touched back up the wheels and all the long hours. All the ways we were up at the wheel, ah, did nothing. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no思ings and useful. That's amazing that we got this. instruction and machinery, my dad's general friends, he didn't kill himself. There was a series of accidents. He cut his nose on bargwire, hammered his nose, fell off staging two times, broke several ribs, collapsed along nearly ripped his pain, and then there was the worst of all. We had been out for the day, and came back, and was told to you, and just, and just, and just, and I decided that I cut up some good, some good, some good poldation, some good work. and Jesus is in the Bible. So I had not got up in the Bible. So I said I would just work on that and I was trying to do it very fast because he's getting gone. I said I'm not going to be there. And I was just standing in the pile of wood, I thought it was the bad way to go. And kicking the side there, cut in pieces of stuff. And my foot rolled on one and I fell full. He's in the pile and the chains are in front and the tip is in the pile. kick back. And as I fell closed, I turned around, laid face and it caught down the chin. Oh God! Missing cutting my photo, I just inches. What do you mean? You're , I can't fit this. I thought I'd come to the photo. I remember it's some pieces. So, bragged pink flesh on them and it's chin. That's my brother Emilio. He's 25 now. He's about five to five. I remember, mom packing towels against his neck and me out on the towel for driving to the hospital. Bringing up the blood. Bringing up the blood. And I don't remember, mom, he's a sick and sick boss. He don't remember who's coming in this morning. and the door with his hand, the red net, and the lung just gushing out and he said, maddie, I cut myself. It's just  that voice that was words. It was so scary. I just had a quote on the middle of the music. If my dad had his dream of a rural constant, and my mom had her dream of being hurt. and I had my little house on the Great Fantasy. It's interesting, is that Amelia had an entrance that I moved to me. He was just for, and as best as any of us can figure, he was the only one of us who didn't see the whole experience through romantic days. By August that person where he was asking Dad, when are we going to come home, meaning home to our apartment in New York, and Dad had to tell him we are home. So, I... I had an interesting discussion with that about bravery, about bravery versus insanity. Was he crazy or was he brave? Was he a hero or was he a saint? Where do you come down on that? This is very interesting because the framing of the question is very telling you, you're vision of him, but I don't quite get. myself and I get it but I hesitate to say that it's the sort of a little girl vision of the father but it definitely is I just don't remember him is being crazy or insane or well we see other choice her road yeah I remember spending a lot of time and being part of this kind of everyday building the house particularly in the lunches down the sprawl lumber just a lot of time to just be with and just riding around and green truck at him. So being this sidekick and I really thought it was cool. Talking to Amelia, I was surprised. I hadn't really thought about this, but it's no accident by mom called the book means that. This was my dream, not at all. So, I read the misadventures with mom. Do you want to hear a little bit from us? Please, yeah. This is the section when mom and dad are telling us that we're going to be leading New York. And we're over to our next one. And we are. Oh, really? We are. We're going to be doing this. Oh, yeah. this is so much fun. And then will we ever come back to the city to live in the ask quietly turning to daddy? To be honest with her, I don't know. The city is a good place to live in and grow and so is the country. We've been in the city for a long time and life has been very happy. It's a cold and means that in Milio, I don't want to be cold. Yes, the winter's in Maine are cold, so bloody, but will have a good hot wood stove for indoors, layers of clothing for outdoors. You won't be cold, Emilio. You'll be snug as a bud. Shh. Shh. I won't mind the winter. I really want to have some animals, of Nima. And a puppy has to look out. I think we surely could shit mommy. And Daddy will run over it with a truck. Primelio and me, the move to Maine is the central factor of our childhood. One of the central forces shit. in who we are. As we've grown up, we've found we both have our father's mania when it comes to taking on big projects. We both worked ourselves literally on the injury. As a teenager, Emilio tried to embrace rural life. He threw himself into a lot of planning, got wilderness first-aid certification, led hiking trips. He was as obsessive about lot of plans, and dad was about building the house. Here's another thing that I think about. Are we sick kids? Are we conrictions? Oh, well, hey, bye. Definitely decided that I was a city pit the height of my attempt to become a builder in strip later And I was cultivating very natural some adventurous personality at Swarthmore and leading rock climbing flow and then going in lots of heights and I went down I skipped my final exam study period when I was 19 and I went to Go for a week long hike someone shendowns a thing and got through days into it, I realized that. Against every, every sort of instinct that I had and every wish that I had for myself the rugged outdoors that I was really sitting at and came out of nowhere. And remember feeling upset about it. On par with, , the organization that was possibly gay at 16 and they're very similar sort of that moment at which the self or self image and the self knowledge have nothing being ch gosh. I think that makes me feel so. So I'm sitting there. Amelia is moving back to New York to get his PhD in anthropology. She's six blocks from where we lived on the upper west side. 460 miles away from our Nelson Mandela. It feels  this is a person that doesn't think it's just a member of the family. I feel  I would be really hurt when I was in the sky. If it were solid, it would be really hurt when I was in the sky. I don't think there's any danger going to be nearby. What if something broke a land and tore down the house? Right. I thought about blowing myself upon the machine. I'm not doing that for the house. Whereas I would feel in some way that I could finally get on with my life. It's the... It was the difference. I mean, this bit of a story that a family's moved to make continues in the minute, but I'm a pretty much anhash. It's a American life, my regards. Each week in our program, of course, which is a theme, bring a variety of different kinds of stories in the community. Today's show, Dreamhouse, parents who try to build a brighter After- for the families and what happens to them in the tribe. We continue with memes spidolis story about a parent's new family. Just pulled in the driveway here. ... this is hard enough. Hell. To do this radio story, I went home to Maine for the first time two years. How many times does this? And that's home. Just go to my room here. Push. This is promising. This completely depends on where I'm sitting tolerated. That's totally oblivious, he's planning piano,,. It doesn't even hear me! ry erry Even though I hate it. Sneak it. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. You're done, little bliviest play, but be out of it. How did you speak up on me? I'm out of my mind. I'm out of my mind. While I was home, my dad and I talked to him, we don't have a smooth summer of 1976. We've never talked as much about that time. We walked about his ethnicity, created a Christian plan, and visited all the old science, where we could continue to be honest. Please. CD, the rope, and the tree that was or swim. That was your swim. Yeah. We said that. That was good. Good. That was good. Hey, did  about this in the millionaires? Did you go there on the hat as well, House? No. Show me. It wasn't a real squirrel house. This was a game that we played. And that, well, we were building your house. We were building our house. We were the school family. And it was written. right over here. , you. I asked sort of, is it wrong though? I asked dad to give me a tour of the house's distance hidden. The porch you front is happening. The floor is something. She brought us an upper-most room. The bathroom isn't done yet. And I guess I haven't got it on the second tunnel. It really matters to me. These days my dad's not getting to me. He took pains to point out this finish a lot of classes now. Except this one. Oh yeah, I'm scared. just have a wideward trance, they don't have the oak trance and it's just  this. And this little piece of wool doesn't have anything to do with the sheet rock. But I did run the wire a bit so now I can fit the sheet rock. I didn't have any walls on my bedroom until I was  15. Oh really? Yeah, oh my goodness. Oh, I'm so... It's okay, it's okay. And I didn't have a door for a long time. I have a door on my old room now. Yeah. It doesn't have a door knob. So when you close it, it closes and then you have to put your fingers in and over it. This is the idea of how to share. Of course to be an advocate for medicine. It's a great first and foremost. You can't even finish his own house. Well, I was home doing these interviews. There were a lot of plans in my dad's garden company. And I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't remember someone. So I kept pushing. finally after days of this, he told me something I never understood before. We shared this experience, moved to me, but we didn't see it the same way at all. Every time I talked about it as a heroic adventure, it just cringey. For years, you saw the move as a grim series of failures. He dropped out of college, and this was his biggest attempt to redeem himself to make something of his own. And every snowstorm broken down car, every unfinished part of the house, every single crisis was a referendum on his character. desperately he struggled, things kept slipping out of this control. And even as I say this, I feel incredibly resistant to seeing it this way, because it means that I have to reconstruct my entire heroic vision of my childhood. One of the long-term effects, I sort of joke about, and it's also true, is that you've set up this kind of ideal of what a man should do, that Most men couldn't really live up to and it's again. It's me mine Including you yeah Turns out my dad would be more comfortable if I didn't seem as the hero of an adventure story My agenda isn't true. isn't to explore your myth that you did ask me to To get my version of it because you felt  you'd mythology I stood It's funny. It's  people will ask me also that I will what are your parents  and , you, just the fact is you're not  a big band. You're not, how tall are you dad? Five, seven. Right, you're not a big guy. You're very, you're strong, you're, , you're muscular. But you're not this huge macho guy. , you were a math teacher, you played piano. But you were just  the coolest dad ever. No, really, you were. You, , you made a bicycle. You didn't make a bicycle for me. But remember that bike I got the first bike. And you painted it red and you wrote Mima on the side. Yeah. , you were just  the coolest dad ever. You did, you built us loft beds in Manhattan and you, there was a swing in our room and a bar to swing on and , and then you moved us up to Maine. It was , how much cooler could you get them to hatch? It's nice to hear. It's really nice to hear. I didn't know of all. Oh, you wanted to know where the elephant. So we walked to see where the outhouse was. The structure was gone. I was filled in, filled over, never existed. My dad told me he doesn't want to be judged and that one period in my life. Let me move to name. And I sit in my dorm and say that this is from life, living in the house. Now, I don't know if my life is meant for this and the lot too. I was  having children and raising children. It worked  that. Now I understood. I'm in relationships, I'm in relationships, I'm in love. So we're breaking down, do you? I guess in some ways maybe I need to diffuse the importance that this is happened. Do  what I mean? Perhaps. Just because it happened at such an important time, this was my child. girl and I mean I don't have many memories before or time when this was happened. I mean this is what I'm saying. This is what I come from. This house. It was  a family member. I mean really it was so present. But  that that's you. And I don't know that you have to necessarily the bank of me so I leave now quite someини. What would it be  to me if I just  stayed with this? Well, zip this is the assumption, don't you mind? Do anything else? Well, that would be . Then that would be that, then that would be super obsessive. If not, it's just not sufficient, either. It's not enough for me. It's not, and it's in some ways. , we have had a different experience of it enough in one way or another. the common things. It's not. It doesn't mean it isn't having this, it's the go-ah of the family. I don't think that's entirely true. For years he couldn't work on the house. He just stopped. if he stopped trying, he'd stopped failing. But over the course of talking about this for weeks while I put together this story, something changed. It happened after he told me about feeling  he'd failed. Somehow after that conversation it felt  there wasn't anything more to say about that time. And for the first time in years, my dad started working on the house again. He called me the other night. He says he's already finished the bathroom, couldn't a beautiful tile floor, replaced the grave loyalty Ashiva that still makes me ill totally upset. Maybe Steven Smith judge is different. We must try to. Thank you. They get home to the Father. I bow through the trees and there in the night. My father's house stood shining hard and bright. The branches and roundles. for my most fragile arms. But I run to my bed shaking his arm. At two, goodbye dream. Ronald Reagan made my family's track to him into a dream. Just about the time of his long-slightly election in 1984. Ronald Reagan knocked out the North and West facing wall with my help. tore up the linolean floor and the flock ceiling of the family. Ronald Reagan gave my mother a kitchen, quite serious, we all gave my father a shop of his own, just off the road. It's David Bear's reading from his memoir Bruce died dream. Ronald Reagan built his family dream house by funding the strategic defense initiative, start wounds. David Bear's father was an aerospace engineer, and back in 1957 after the Russian satellite muting the spot in the excavation into a new text in the street boom. Bruce family joined 10 to 1000. others went to work in aerospace and noted California. Here's what I would  to do. I would  to see what defense projects through the Cold War and Vietnam War. So, these days, the suburbs could be precise as a place of sheer materialism. The reason why it was not materialism that was effective to his family when they moved out to the California suburbs. It was the emptiness in the place. It was effectively to create new modern lives. Populize. Correcting new traditions. He rated it 1.2 smother actually to set it with his Irish. Even though. really they were only one fourth average. But let's not let those facts get in the way. My mother decided that a fun thing to be was an Irish Catholic. And so she was determined to invent this Irishness for us in the middle of Mediterranean California. So there were leprechauns living in our oleanders. And when we on St. Patrick's Day, we all lined up in our mother clip to our little Catholic school read sweaters these green buttons that said, just me, I'm Irish and shamrock with plurney. She avoided all together some of the other stereotypes of Irishness. The idea of the morose Have you drinker? Did she just select a part you ? Well, that was the great thing about the suburbs in California and anywhere else in the country where this great federal investment and Cold War infrastructure is going on. These were brand new places. There was the opportunity to invent a culture and you constructed that culture with what you had available to you. Can I ask you to talk to him in a bit about how you saw your dad when you were a kid? In your book, in the memoir, you described him sort of in scene after scene as showing up with the lumber and building stuff and laying down a new brick walkways and putting a deck behind the house of constantly having one project after another. You read it one point, there's nothing my father could not do himself apparently. He wasn't always successful. I think he spent six months designing the spring for systems for back yard. I'm turned and I was wondrous to be hope. , the rain birds all swept around in their perfect arch. What have you but the grass didn't grow as it turned out he'd picked them on seed for the soil and then the water didn't fully cover the ground and as it turned out much  the aerospace itself he had to keep going back and revising his plans and went terribly over budget but in the end got the grass to grow that was the main message there which is the third technology and personally re-enseed the Well, you've agreed to read along the excerpt of the book, who was , you read about it in the book. What did you call your tribe, the aerospace workers in the family, moving into a valley that was first known as the valley of parts of life, building a home in a brand new subdivision, with the old world name Clarence and Man. Whenever I think of the house they bought in the developments around the home, you really see me just coming in the mind or having a set of fairness to the streets, the lots of room, the snapshots. firm. There I am with my new friends around a picking table in the back yard. Shirtless boys with mouths full of birthday in the backyard nothing but in planted dirt, the stripe of redwood fence, scucko, milk and sky. That was the emptiness being chased by thousands of other young ones to similar back yard and various rock corners of the nation. Didn't the sterility stare to how out of you I've often asked for mother? Didn't you look around wonder if you've been stuck on desert ice? The questions never phased it. We were thrilled to death, not afraid at all. Everyone else was moving in at the same time as us. It was a whole new adventure for us. For everyone. Everyone was arriving at the sense of forward moment and journey. Everyone was taking courage inside of another orange living thing, pulling the next door. Family just  us unloading coal lamps and crids on micadiene tables  our own. Having been given the atmosphere. long for, their lay had the task point you into the back. We were black conquerors, Monk Trid. When he chose a new homeland and made it a place settled at, and made it over in our image, he did so with the smiling sense of our own inevitability. First, we would establish a few outputs, Pentagon funded research university. say, or a bomber commonsense or a missile test range, and then over the next decade or two, we would arrive by thousands of tens of thousands until nothing looked or felt as it had before. Yet whenever we sent our advance teams to some place  the Valley of Hearts to Life, we did not cause peace and populace, more likely a flurry of joyous meetings of the chambers of commerce and rotary clubs. You can understand then why families  my intended to behave with a certain humorous? In the spring of 1962 the Valley of Hearts the Light was covered with blossom. Back then the cherry and plum and apricot trees would frost so white and heat, the driving around the place felt  burling through cotton. Spanish colonizers had planted the first of these clay. On more mevenies in the spring of 1962. This is what my father and mother made. After dinner they would place my baby sister in her school and the four of us would set out from a small, used house that were renting in an established subdivision already half a dozen years old. The name Strawberry Park. We would walk six blocks and run out of sidewalk. We would pick up a wide trail that could have put in a half deep into the Adobe ground, a winding road bed of waiting black top. At a certain point we would leave the road bed. Make our way at the top. and the awesome muddy clay that was crossed hatched by tractor-trip, driven by pipe-trip. Who had marvel at the pass-on-feet sewer sections lying about, gray, new-stretching barrels, big enough for me to crawl inside. Who had breed in the sap-scented two by four stacked around it, snow-up clams ready to go forward. Finally, we would arrive at our destination, collection of yellow and red ribbons tied to small wooden states, sprouting mud. These markers I did not know. modified the outline of Lot 242 of Unit 6 of Track 3113. Exactly 14,500 square feet of Amphines that now belong to Earth. All around the outline were piles of cherry and plum apoptries. The roots ripped from the ground. The spring blossom still communes with their tangled up branch. The spring blossom still communes with their tangled up branch. Our right evolved at the season. Early on, my father would go from stake to yellow ribbon stake, following us where the kitchen would be, where the front door would, which window would be getting the most sun. Later after the concrete foundation, I would sub-floor in my hand, and the skeletons of walls were up. He would wander through the materializing form of our home, already inhabiting foreign animations. It's perfect to pinch you out. Within a decade after the coming of aerospace to the Valley of Arts Delight, developers were shilling out nearly $100,000 per acre for any land left that might still be covered with flossing. This should give an idea of the quiet force my people exerted whenever they entered a place. How are enough to undo a century old economy? And strip the blossoms from the Valley. once and for all. My people did sigh at the extinction of those blossoms, but honestly we did not mourn their disappearance in any deeply felt way. Certainly we didn't feel guilt. We had not after all come to the Valley of Hearts Delight to try to circle a rhythm of nature. Our imagination was linear, we're sitting forward and not for it. And our lines did not curve back on themselves as did the season. We saw promise in the clean possibilities that arose once every blossom had been a rick. space, never do you. Several valleys over from ours, Joan Didney, and watched the coming of Mo Tribe and Fred. We moved here to write in a 1965 essay how it felt to be a native daughter. She had come from a family who has always been in the Sacramento Valley and to see that the boom was on and the voice of the aerospace engineer would be purred in the way. 15,000 aerospace work, almost all of them imported, and arrived on outskirts of Sacramento to join Arrowjet Gemma, the maker of missile research. Film Dittian's family was,  the orchard people of the Valley of Arts to light, a family tied to agriculture, but the hundred years of circular rhythms behind them. First were people, Primly Insler, and tragic-minded, according to the native daughter. The Valley was a place where in cautious children. and visiting from out of town, often would drown in the river, disappear forever. And the old locals would see a proper lesson in that. Would say, as Joan Diddings grandmother did, they were from a way that parents had no business letting them in the river. And another essay written five years later Diddings gets a profound difference between group people and Mon. She writes of growing... have convinced that the heart of darkness lies in not some error of socialisation, but in the end's own blood. Through the fields or self in other words, to be a pessimist about human endeavor, engineered and executed on Grand State. How different from my tribe, who would say instead, if encosious children might drowning a river, let us direct a cyclone fence, even drive a river undergrin, leaving behind a men-factured surface that was dry and safe. empty and speaking of thoughts. That after all is what was done to create a rambike learned in the end. Within ten years of my family's arrival, the valley of parts of the light was no longer green. It had become a vast matrix of expressways, planned in the end. The vast matrix of comfort. and he's making technology primarily for the government. Population and grow many times over in those teams. And you no longer feared the valley of parts to light, called that anymore. In fact, no one I knew had ever used that sedimental. While I was growing up, my family simply had called it the valley. Whereas it was officially turned on the government studies and plans of various developers, a Santa Clara valley. We're not the until a time distant, well into the 1970s. that we would begin calling our home, Silicon Valley. There was yet another right of spring practice by my family, a right that became possible once the invasion of my tribe was all but complete. Once nearly all the blossoms had been replaced by settlements  our own. On an evening that was bright and windy, the two warm would be winter. anymore. My father would come home from Lockheed with a tighter tooth. Also sticks wrapped tightly, colorful tissue paper. If the next morning was a Saturday, he would put the kites together for us, terrace a tail from an old sheet, make a string bright on a velvet kite just so. Alps launched the kite and send it out over the track. For just this very purpose, my father kept what seemed a mile of pine on an enormous school. And so the kite would prime higher and higher. built the commission. Against the blue. At that point my father would go into his garage and make a small parachute. He would unfold a paper napkin and tie its corners before strands of string drawing the other ends of the string together and nodding them around the bolt for weight. He would stick a bit of re-enforcing tape in the center of the napkin and pass through that event and making a hook hooked out of the top of the parachute. Next my father would write our phone number up. parachute with the words, if found, he's called. Ready for takeoff? My father would say is a grab pulled-up with pot-pite strength. And then a miraculous thing happened. Given by the wind, parachute would skitter up the line. During the kite, I am the sky who it seemed to instantly. I'm going to reach the top. My father would say, give her a jerk. And parachute would fall away from the kite, and drift in whichever direction the wind is blown, until we could see it in the long. Then would begin the wait for the phone during. The wait for someone to call and say they had our parachute. The flowers might buy my mother might suggest the prayer to see an anthem, finder of lost item. Tony, Tony, listen, listen, hurry, hurry, something's missing. He has to believe. If he said the prayer and did believe, the ring would come. Someone would say, got your, , I guess it's a parachute here. I landed in my backyard, almost ran over it with the mull. The father would write down the address and he would get out the street. He would pinpoint our destination and we older kids would set off on our steamer vices, having been given a reason to trace around. He never would have traced otherwise. So empathy, so much to see, every street from mild enough. We would leave our cul-de-sac-name pine hill court, but there was neither a pine market. We would pedal far beyond springwood dry and pass happy that we will. And we happened some cold-sac. they would not know the reason. And there would be a man doll my father's name, but the similarly receiving fellow, Knits Fortune. Man is simply pleased that the senate did put us fun, our tertiary, brought into his Saturday. Man who safely could be assumed to do Bruce Sky worked for a living. Anywhere we cared to drop a tertiary from the sky, there would be someone lighting, a house in a family  his, and  ours. It is Bruce Memois, please start. We hear a lot about war, hurricanes, and get our shore. We hear a lot about hard times, and a good deal more about the crimes. We make the front page news. But all that does is sing the blue, but I'm there. Now, one of the good things are live. About the man who loved their wives. You take their kids when they go fishing. Spend their work in their just fishing. Think things better. A fireman who climbs a tree and sets a little kitten for you. A policeman who helps you, draws the avon.
