  "text": "As a species, something tries to make inanimate things survive. There's statues, there's whole ideas to be to create simulation of soft skin, sheer glowing cloth, out of rock, literally out of a rock. Is it true? This too. There is just something about that moment. You can know, you'll stop being a few, strung together pieces of wood. It starts to seem  you're really able to boy. This is what I caught a guy named Ron Blutus. In Schule quoi's. He's best known for being able to make anything pop, banana, box, breakfast, cereal, a sock. To ask him what he makes for this, his dummies are named Fakura Billi, Scorch. When I'm on stage, talk to my puppets, I believe every, I believe to the point as an actor, to use his character. Charles Lodlan of the ridiculous leader had a dummy called Walter and a wrote it one point about Walter. He sometimes says unexpected things. Does that happen with you with that daily or school? He has happened to me. There's a couple of moments to I, I started to get through breakthroughs. I'm working series of comedy clubs and someone asked me if I could do a military club. And I said, yeah, sure. Not a lot of comedy clubs, isn't it? I worked for the implicit, and they were just really into what I was doing. But then I went over to the office. He's called these guys. Wild. I guess it's part of responsibility of command. You're to hang out just with other office. You're going to some go. Perform inchio. to do my script, I could do the show, I had planned. So I just started doing questions and answer stuff. Doc recalls, , half Nick kind of jokes, , nothing that would really hurt anybody, but , I was taking on everybody equally, I had to prep a step before I got to work. So one guy was an officer, Puerto Rico, today where you phone, and he got you to Puerto Rico, done me a bus. But how many Puerto Rico did you take to school at a light boat? And I said, I'm thinking, right, so why did I have to see that? I don't have an answer. Okay. And in a wing, the dummy came up with an answer. One funny enough to make an audience laugh and an officer's knife, but I have to say, not so funny that I want you to alienate our lovely multicultural audience. And why is it so pleasurable for something inanimate to suddenly become a lie through a voice come down? It is fascinating to hold of you. or can you re-ent under what I'm saying. I found myself doing that not too long ago around a table, some other skill request. And what did it say? And it said, , your film is on my box. Okay, of course. Exactly. , I treated it more  a person. I didn't think of it as you'd fill it to your what it's gonna do. I thought it was sort of a human form, and my film was a long place. which is exactly the point. Every object wrong with this makes me. Keep returns as a person. This is exactly what we're doing as the species all the time, turning things into people. And it begins when we show interest, playing with dolls. Let's recommend and win. Today in our program, what that's all about? WV EZCHKO, Public Radio International, to some American life, how my regardless. Today's show, Stories of Dolls, Dolls of our Swords. And what is it all about? At one, they have in for little girls, made of plastic. The story of a company that has figured out all the different ways that girls  dolls and is trying to sell to nearly every single way they can think of. To,  what Mr. Bear would say, the author of a one-stay in the series of children's books about Adal and how her life came to resemble Adal's. That dream. The boy who would be a helicopter can be a teacher-vivian pali tells the story of how, and his age when schools are eliminating the dog corner at younger and younger ages. It was playing with dogs, so to save the kid in her class, stay with us. I won. Thank Heaven for Little Girls, made of plastic. About a year ago here in Chicago, just around the corner from all the fancy stories that you for three-state radius, Nike Town and Sony Gallery and Neemin Marcus and all those time. Come to the began an experiment in marketing dolls, little girls. They opened a store, the only ones they've opened anywhere. American light producer Susan Burton headed down. American girl plays. It's American girl's place, not American girl's store. The word place was what thrilled me, before I'd ever set foot inside. It seemed to denote a project of such grand scale. Delgmaani men are directly paid. at mile and they will come. You see them on Saturday afternoon, downtown, swarms of little girls. What you notice first are the shop and bags, which are bright, crayola marker red, with American girl place stamped and white across the side. I'll steer, grow up with bags. Even if the bags are large, banging against their legs, the girls tend to carry them by themselves. In good coats and tights and merry james, they look little girls pretending to be little girls. The question of what to wear to American girl place has clearly been given travel consideration. Some girls are dressed  their dolls. I have the purple 2000 millennium outfit. There's purple tights that's sparkly and purple skirt that goes down to about my knees. I have a purple tank top with a purple, a car and again. Whitney Robertson is 11 years old. He came here from St. Louis with her mother Laura. She's shirt one. care braces. She must have kind of heightened for malady. It's as if she's wearing something magical and doesn't dare disturb the spell. That's an interesting thing is when she got her braces this year at Christmas time. She had to have purple what do you call them spacers? ,  the purple rubber bands, because I got my braces a few days after Christmas, so I knew I got, , the 2000. So that's only reason I got purple. Otherwise, I wouldn't get, I would have gotten my repairing. I'm a rural thing girl. Whitney and her mother have come to American girl plants, not to Chicago, and the same way that you go to Disney World, front and to Orlando. This is Whitney's first time here. Parents gave her different perspectives. There was a series of presents. The first one was in necklace that said Northern Expressions, and I really didn't get at the time, but it was kind of a clue that we go north from St. Louis. And then the next one was something from HU, I think it was a knack. plus AG American girl. And then the next one was airline tickets to the AG place. I really had this questioning look on her face  what? And then it dawned on her and then she just went, oh my gosh, and started to cry. Chips! In the stores first year, about 40% of its million visitors have come from out of town. This is Retail's Game Park destination shopping. There's a concierge desk, Coach checks on both the first and third floors. There's a cat thing. and clothing department, a museum and a live musical, loads of furniture and accessories, shelves, souvenirs, and of course the Dolphin cells, which cost $82 each. A former school teacher with a story book named Pleasant Rowland, caught up with the American Girl Dolls collection of teen years ago. There are six historic dolls, each represents the Dishrin era, and is accompanied by a series of chapter books about her life in times. Sameathe, delicious! popular known as Victorian girl, Molly Misses her father, despiteing a little more to, Addy escapes slavery and with North Philadelphia. The girls are spunky and dependent and the books are full of starcled hotel, quilting these supper-deuts, victory gardens. About five million dolls have been sold since 1986, mostly by catalog . The company won't say to whom, but as a poor three-teacher, Whitney's mother has noticed which girls tend to, Now, I teach in a poor area outside of St. Louis, and most of the people would be lower middle class. I would say that's 5% of my 90-tonior olds right now. Now, I got her school who is in the middle class, maybe upper middle class area, probably a good 80%. I know, go, I'm almost go, yes, because you'll see them wearing the t-shirts, you'll see them cheering the dolls. They talk about it a lot, and just it's a big thing. The crowd in the store seems well off, mostly, but not entirely white. One girl, who must be elves 7, with elegant up swept hair and a long burgundy coat, carries a wire shop and basket around the old day with the authority of the jeepedry ares. Whitney didn't even  dolls from mother tells me, until she'd have the first Samantha book three years ago. The history grew Whitney into the doll. The mother of a girl say tattoo. do seem to genuinely  and learn from the books. But mostly, the girls play with these dolls the way they play with any dolls. They insert them into various domestic dramas, new school, orton, the universally popular my girls come in over to your girl's house, and they do their hair. And here that the problem with Molly is that her peatails always fall out that most girls prefer to undue her stings braids. Thank you, brush. You get a little piece of the hair. You brush it from the onus. I was certain kind of brush and for  five minutes and they turned out more shiny than it was and it won't be as good The ingenious thing about American Girl Places is not only that they seem to understand what Girl wants to do when she plays with her doll But that they know how to participate in the game with her It's as if the marketers stepped into the center of a girl's dream and are selling to her from a purchase her own unconscious The doll hair care products in this store right will do these products Employees roam lower, spensing styling tips. So, we're showing them down there, how to brush their hair and how they could put it up into little curlers, again, Whitney's mother Laura. But water on it and it would be shinier and not, , it'd be curled. I mean, they were taking the time to do this down there, unbelievable. American Girl Place knows what girls want. And these days, this includes the look they liked up. The American Girls of Today are available. or 20 different skin, hair, and eye color combinations. Almost every single girl I talked with a today doll, so she picked one she did because it looked  her. And the today accessories are very developed to allow any girl to pursue her particular obsession. I'm pretty set because I know I wanted to be a true alien cast. I've been wanting to even for about a year. I said, we're not sure why. The medical thing, I don't know. That's Carrie. She's eight. She and her sister got the wheelchair yesterday. They've come back for the Opera Skieset, which includes a tiktok toward a tiny premise and, most important, a bright yellow cast. They also want the dog's life. For accidents. They're in the midst of a complicated disaster narrative, sort of wild American meat, little house hockey which they began during their carton to shop. Carrie needs to pass for a related story. Because... They're playing a game and they're going to earn a kid being took course back ready and on the way back she falls and gets stopped at the right. Then they're the collectors, the mint and boxers. By making those collectible American girl plays Pinky Girls buying dolls long past the age they normally would. The family's can be a little spooky. I meet one grandmother who pulls from her hand back, photographs of her granddaughter's closet. The S photos are a closet. filled with American girl accessories. Step-and-other, who's also in school. Tells me that the girl has everything for cursed. For a while there, she thought that this was too Fabius for her, because she kind of got out of it. But then I think she's just realized that, , this is  something that you've collected, and you can just enjoy your whole life really. I was telling her about to me more, that she has a collection of dolls, and she has a special house for all of your dolls. So, it's... It's just, it's a nice happy. Downstairs on the first floor, Whitney and her mother looked for the diaromance. There are glassed and living rooms filled with period furniture, one for each historic character, and display cases of accessories and clothing. The other thing I would  to do is, we over at Light Carilawel in the summer when it's 104-happable, something  that. I mean, it's basically a dress. Girls move past the diaromance and chronological order as if in a museum. But now I need to solve. a very field trip shuffled. They love this stuff. A girl dressed as Samantha, lenders for Samantha's showcase, posing for pictures, staring at the doll's nightstand, and her tiny copy of the Wizard of Oz. These items are called realy. Which is the perfect word to describe what's so compelling about American girl. Everything you buy makes the world of the doll more real. It makes her more real, which is what a lot of girls would talk to their dolls. Now,ulas! in the music overview, the theater is just past the dioramas. This all's are literally brought to life. Channel for your 6-Rosey Cheek Middle School age girls, who act out stories the audience are in news from the American girl books. After the musical, I have teams with Anne from mother. The cafe is elegant in a cartoon swing. Dark pink carpet, lamp-studded with plastic rubber daisies, over-stuffs, straight chairs. There's a harpist playing a back-street voice on. Skones and T-Samwiches are served on teared platters. Girls sit from ice-pink lemonade, they sit up straight, they're giggly and polite. There's a way in which the whole American girl-place experience seems orchestrated around this moment. That hour-winter girl plays out her own story books. Steps into the illustration. what he evaluates to me. Then she says this. In the theater and all in the American girl play the employees make the Dallas feel  they're real and make you feel they're real and it's really really neat. What do they do that makes the Dalton real? in the tea and the lunch in the cafe room they get a chair for the Dal and  if she has her. dress on, fix the dress and set her in it and then put her on the table. Almost everyone in the room puts one of these miniature chairs to her table. The girl could table next to us neatly hanged Molly's going to coat over the bat. And even though the chair is per sale outside for $25, there's something lovely about seeing everyone engage in the same game of pretend to matter. We need on the upper end the American girl to her graphic. She says that in sixth grade, a lot of things that all her baby show, that she doesn't take her. around to places. And as she gives Samantha a sip from a tiny tea cup, slips the nap and hold her that also serves as a scrunchie enter her hair. It's clear that one of the things she likes so much about the sword is that it's a public space for private dolls. Maybe the only sip place anywhere. It's almost five o'clock when we finish tea and Whitney has to make her last purchases. She has to be American girl today, real, which is the only place in the school where you see packs seven-year-old girl. shop and live out their mothers. The atmosphere that of slumber party gone high. The walls are painted black, feels  a nightclub for little girls. Whitney wants to get a please jacket per doll. When that looks exactly  a please jacket from the gap with fluid and the dryer for a month. You sure that's absolutely what you want. But it's not a theme outfit. I thought you wanted another theme outfit. I do but I really want this one. I would rather value a theme. Okay, let's go get a theme up. A theme up that means an historical outfit. With these mothers pushing for the educational experience. You take the escalators down too close to the turn of the sentience amount of clothing. With the points at a straight dress with a tin of warmth. Over the top, pink, straight dress with a little pink for the meal rips. And that one, 42. But I also  the prep cape and gater. I do! But I'd  the regular clothes up there, butter. We head back up to the American girl of today. Girls pulling up boxes, trying on slippers, crowding me aisles in the final shop at the friends. This is the only thing in the store that's not going to make those. Fine. What works? The procedure. I'm going to the regular clothes. The ADA today. Bring your shoes and start off. It's an outfit that girls wear in musicals finale, white overalls and blazing with a silka star. She also has adult-sized American girl-placed t-shirt and a snowdown that kills a song in the musical. These accessories are to be out of history, or anything other than the experience of coming to the store. Her brand itself. One thing what you  about the outfit she's bought for her doll, she's healthy, is that it comes with a miniature red shop in that. Sam, the words American girl-placed. They cast your purse. and she and her mother had out to Michigan app. She's in burden. Well, she was a man who came to raise the promises. She couldn't have taken care of the world. She was a little more alive. Some way else. Back to the world. Back to the world. I'm a little bit more alive. Some way else. Back to the world. Back to what Mr. Barrow would say. Because it children's book that just came back in print that is truly one of the most remarkable books I have ever seen The kind of book that all this week whenever anybody from our staff mentioned the book somebody who happened to have read it as a child There was actually this bonding moment that's the only way to describe it. There would be a bonding moment and then excited stories that what the book meant Then's here She Nathan tells the story of the book and it's off of and how the office life came to resemble something from book It was in the spring of 19th 27 that the audits damagedverted into my mind. The cover of children's book I hadn't seen made in the bottom of these pictures. They're at large dinner remade. It felt as if or a message in its instance to start up at all, I live among burners. But the image just kept flashing in my mind. You can write in them, insert with a black and white photo down. I've eaten the lonely doll and opened book to spread out such nice. My own copy of the Lonely Doll was long lost and I soon learned from a bookstruck that gave me the name as well. There were write, the book was out of print. The New York Public Library's computer is to three copies, all damaged in this. When I called the children's bookstitch, it was to be a phone book. She said she knew the book well and would add my name to her wedding. We need to close the phone book. I found myself turning to start to be the list of these for the name write. There, jumping out at me. in bird columns of type-based wealth. Right, there are 11 East-Adeed Street, two, four, nine, six, nine, six, five. I don't think I could have been any more amazed because the address didn't even say. Second, the right and the straight on to the morning. Peter pans out of this on the island of Nipra. In the weeks to come, I dialed the number several times. There was never an answer. I also sent a letter expressing how much the book he'd meant to me with a child and that's when she lived where I could off. Several months later, I finally received the money doll from the books. It was stated that black and white photographs, the money doll is destroyed, dolling to the... Mired in loneliness, seemingly countless, eating her serial of her own, going to bedermur, begging subtitles in the language that we have learnt and watchingns big were expire. One morning, two teddy bears, Mr. Bear and Little Bear, appear in her garden. They tell her that they come to be fixed. They move out in. Home alone one many day, he didn't move a bear to scuff behind the saddle blue boots, a grown-up leaves closet and just the identities he's in. And her abs to another's way. She might be either smarter or from all indications, even past. A frenzy drassist. session follows in which either the middle bearer during themselves with fine stone feet folds, a pedicum and a hotly roses in the face. High heel shoes are represented. In their references, a lock of her is one long stem for her. The water spills into jewelry box that they are of her piece. Rilling a full piece with all that lipstick. Little bearer goes, either she could have gone. She says she wouldn't dare. You never mister bear with saying. And just as little bear user. The rooster squall, Mr. Bear is just a silly old thing, crossed the old from here. Who should appear if I, Mr. Bear? Spankings ensued at the deep-rish, striking terror in either, Is that her disobedience could jeopardize the whole arrangement, And that Edus would be once again abandoned and lonely. Yet when the little ones clean up from that, So you promise never to do it again. Mr. Bear solemnly promised that he and Little Bear would stay with forever. I was a little nervous. About 10 different times, I received a phone from a woman who moved to the house. She said, my letter had been forwarded to her account once. She said she was there's an official goddaughter and legal guardian. And if there, no 84 was in a hospital in life, she said she was coming to New York to begin closing up there's part. Did I want to meet her? When I arrived at the apartment, book met me at the door and let me to the room. I was spelled out. The living room is filled with portraits, some live-size of a beautiful bathroom. That's Derek Brooks said. They were all painted by him. There, I was shocked to realize, looked very much  Edith, the room he'd all. And Edith I was named for there's much. As I thought, book gave me tears. that leather-bound scrapbook containing the record for publishing, including jacket covers, reviews, and other articles relating the first 12-month-long experience for children. The Lonely Doll was the first part. I have never known for this. The Lonely Doll received mountains of publicity when it was first published in 1997. It was serialized in good housekeeping, it kind of. children's best solace to meet up to. It was translated as six-point languages and the name of it, in various formats for 35 years. I sorted through the piles of clippings and photographs I've been given by book. Mostly they were photographs there. There were magnificent photos of their plane dress up in Robert Costs, from the startly ones to their cost spectrum of it in what could be described as endless or partially so. These photos were just as close to those first post. There, as I just began to discover, had lived in her own version of a one-day life. I spent the next two years talking to anyone at the time who time to make sense to the world at the same time. In 1917, when there was three, her parents, her father was getting custody at theirs. five-year-old brother's name. Pants seem to have made a pact that the brother and sister should never see each other. Darren had mother moved to Cleveland, Ohio. Her mother put a doll made that the Italian company Wenshe, on real call at how he brothers a department store near their home until she could make the full 11 dollars into that paint. The two named the doll either. He dee, as there's mother was known, was a portrait painter some man out. Those who sought for her included instant shirts show, Calvin Corvage and Gettacargo. And in 1924, one of her subjects offered who used to hand-houses Cleveland College wrote as a student. For the next 45 years, it's 1500 square feet, with a northern exposure skylight with the same year she moved in, eating in low-dair as boarding students in private girls. Their graduated in high school in 1934. And moved to New York to attend drama and art school. She didn't know that her brother Blaine was also the beauty. Their uncle orchestrated the beauty in central part of the 22-year-old tall handsome Blaine and the 19-year-old movie Golden There. According to one of the dearest customers, Blaine and their fellow Mark, they even considered pursuing more better in sister relationship in order to marry an idea they eventually dropped. Their child with little success to the enactors. and then went on to work his passion model, including a state as the maiden from Borgor. Soon she switched to the other side of the camera and her passion talked to the dynamic raining boat, her personal side, and we went. In the early 40s, plain intervals dared to a British friend named Verp Sen, the family produced fort and shared. The tall blonde and dazzling beautiful, there was strangely terrible. wedding and shy and seemed somehow confused by her powers of a net. Philip was ideal for there, throughout their five-year-court she remained in the safe distance. First there was the war and after which he was crossed the ship. They were engaged, but a week before the wedding, Philip called things off. And he hears that father dares close, then Donald Su said, then always did be the past to her door. There was an interest. She never seemed. quite of this world said she was a serial somehow above normal fortune. Throughout all of this, there seems to have hung on to doom that Philip would come back. Evie no doubt found this fantasy. There sent Philip's mother photographs of a learning portrait to Evie being a different spirit. In all of them, there had posed a low-cut white gowns. Evie also did many portraits of Philip, planning her from various photographs. These were signs that were... mother and mom. There are also staged elaborate photographs of herself, seated as you'd hesitate to sort of shrine for it. With a pencil drawing you can cheat sketch and bottle of sandley share. Clutch dinner hands is a letter he had sent. She has turned glancing at the camera, whispered, hope. But in 1951 at the age of 30, the book was killed flying in demonstration air. After Phillips-Dell, their bandit at Versailles New York apartment had a lived into them in the series of hotels. She hung her portraits in Phillips-Dell at the apartment, with one by the front door. She made women's drapes with a window and installed smoke glass mirrors. Her all-white wood wire was fitted out with a top of the canopy princess bed. And next to that set off by the wood doors, was a dressing room with a vanity table, an old room here and a large glass. There in her mother were virtually inseparable. There may be difficulties to her mother's penhouse and thief. And Eady spread at least one week in a month in New York. There. See, as was the custody in the same bed. They seemed to have no idea of the artist this range. As Eady told book, I whichever and how to little bottom of night. Now that they're having her own apartment, Beaty Semelon had been along, including her child's doll. After the first in Beatist trauma after his life, losing her father and her consolation had come in the form of Beatist doll. Now after the second, losing the love, Beatist was back again. Beatist was a mess. For Wraig was yellowed and tangled and her clothes were insured. They are quickly set about giving her completely new book, long-stayped, long hair, usually worn tight up in high-ponyed and gold-hoob earrings. He did the doll, now looked very locked there for so. I don't think of he did this doll, they are told in the movie where she is a personality in one night. A suitor told me that one day began with their tidy, you didn't say hello to either. So he had brutally neglected to acknowledge the human persons. Another time when he tried to kiss, she held the dollar and found it to block the process. There also acquired some teddy bears in this period. After Shabbat, her run on a junkie shop in the street, it doored into its power. A former model, who had a particular head-to-head's motherly agency, where there was registered for a task. Rain was drunk, toy he got, and got here to see her. always did when he drank. He passed at various courts and he saw a teddy bear in the room. He decided I had to have one. In we went, but when he saw the bear as he said it would be terrible to buy just one because the bear would be lonely. Without he'd let itself wind pack up the entire law about a dozen stake bears hundreds of dollars. Since there's apartment was just around the corner, we've been over there carrying all these damn teddy bears. Within minutes of their arrival, do I see the cult? Lain and Dare were seated on the floor surrounded by bears, telling bear stories in various bear voices. Soon Dare added Eda's fiddol to the Christ. Eda's dare later told an interviewer, it looks so happy with the bears that she decided to photograph small-ticket. Soon she was making the room to a book. She thought of a storyline made Eda's house with, and photographed her doll and there's her apartment in Ramirook. She saw her houses. Eda appears to be an animated thing. The story of the moment was in some measure, their own story. The book and her life shared the same sex with, seeking love and approval during the pandemic, the skin situation and the same thinking happening with women who put the blood out of the car. removing another few proceedings and inviting Cartery that he, with love and less uniformed two male predators. With the publication of the lonely doll and the 18 books that followed, came recognition that there had never experienced this wish that she's in high-end country. She told a forty game named Lisa and you're the book does called underlying ABICědiete. and she did her age as 35, satirating first. Her mother, Edie Helen, is completely a non-dolged. Do became sort of cute with Edie Lercist's role. They adored Chaplin and built into storyline's Dersports, the most elaborate one being Lona at their age. But this, they traveled throughout the night, scouting out seniority to the story of the kids, who must ever come to spell it, evil was breast changed to his sister. They are herself both as princess. They are herself both as princess. She looks at it the sharp, focused at her. Don't look at her. And have another position. Even on vacation, they were the one who had the most time hard even made it. I had yet to make my way through the dozen stitches. They were the one who made it. They're sanders as mirrors photographs. Let's see. so much more change. Eda is never without a little bit to bear and always appears in the past, small. In months, she just circulates in the air with pain pressure as they're waiting in that environment. And has changed since their mood is crystal. With none of the base I would have launched. Movement is awkward, dearly as it should have been. ⅔ ⅔ There began photography there, and he said, The obsessive nature of these games, but that same course we can photograph again and again is a variety of cameras. So the most extraordinary is a series of dear ones and we're nothing but a pro net for the limp body, tangled up in just shell, see. Whether face up or face down, all of them she looks as though she did and had just washed up and showed. No one I spoke to you. about this photos, but nearly everyone's where at the extreme closeness, somebody got a relationship. Almost no one knew the existence of the night. The name's been Dorothy, we're called Shouting Match, which she invented, is it, did me? The name would see there all just that by the very Princess, the screen of his mother. And this is just not a doll. You'd see why in the sense, all this energy, and way cold, you'd hear a so important thing. Well, whom the brand of dirty wine beans can be in 1784, E.D. H92, died in New State, and died in New State. With their 261 crimes. For the first time in her life, there had a chance to forge a cell to stay in front of the one baby. Instead, after her mother's death, there seemed to be a hollow cart. She ate less and less, her body became more likely to be at rest. And she worked hard to make up and hear some sort of, so that her matching was on. She was dead. She began to host ghostly gatherings, loaning her pregnant as they she got, lining up her to bed some other, father and pillow, but with a new touch. Sitting herself in an armchair off, she could spend hours on. Sometimes she would talk to a photograph at the level of avalanches that the nurse began caring for and maintaining the same. In 1990, she said that there's a green thing. Under green matter, and this was hospitalized at long-term care experience. I've been serious and mobile peptide means that the waxing head popped up on her first arms resting on her stomach. A tube comes out of his lid and he's got to do that on her head. She is still beautiful even in the city. She is still beautiful even in the city. as if under the evil wizard's spot, golden who brings the high-peer to a ground into one gun, ending in a long-during right way. And the lonely dog was really she passed from. I brought her a cup which I beat a lot to her, I used to this holding the books, she can see the photographs. What she actually hears, or she is, and also to note, that if I glance at her face, why I read, I look at childlike Wendy's kind of, from the moment I hope that's books, kind of. The first half breaks in is rice. The version of Jean-Nate and Story first appeared in Glittery Journal of Tane House. She's working in a book about dare-right, the publisher and her house. Coming up, girl turns helicopter into baby, and other two stories in a minute, 걸iple 여보세요. Behold, it can passione. All right. The smart light of my request to keep the program of course we choose theme and the variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program. That's most important from the beginning. They are characters to the nurture. How do , feeling against your cheek, rocking it, just half it. It's a ballwork of ants. A girl's lawyers, Vivian Palli, kindergarten teacher for decades, one of the Arthur Genius Grand, the many books about the stories that children who've been, when they play what it's about. She says children use dolls and they make up stories for similar reasons. Tacked up moments of feelings that are knocking around their hands. In a classroom, Vivian Palli would have her students invent stories and then act them out. And she says, there's one idea that comes up in small children's stories more than any other. So. Oh, many stores, young children, have to do with an animal or a little girl of white, in love and walking on the woods, in finding some wood. It is the universal, most successful school. And if you have a kindergarten class or a preschool class on a first grade class, and although this would never happen, let's say. All 24 children told this story. There was a long deer that had known to him. And then a cougar came up and said, I'll be your friend. Next door. There was a long boy who had known to play. And on and on, not one child in the class would say, what again? And we had enough of that already? It's a... more. Tell us again when you're longer. Someone's going to come up and say, up. The entire essay that it's by making all stories together, it's not just in the conference. Whenever books you tell us the story of one of the children in our classroom, you used a doll and a story isolated from some of the students. And how it was through other stories and the other children final could mark the isolation. The down in this case was the toy helicopter, Vivian Natelsa's story, but that news recreating scenes from her classroom from transcriptions. What really? Every day in the corner of the classroom, nestled between the block cabinet and the bay window bench, Jason arranged his big wooden blocks into walls, and crouched behind him. He called this as airport, but walls surround him. Hi and that so we can barely be seen. to the town. It's pleased to know you got faster now. You're going faster now you're going to crash now you're going off ground now you're going up up now you're going to love. No you're going to land. Okay, all thing. Jason plays along. He tells stories to himself. He seems on the wear of our habits and customs. The whales and the cry of his helicopter is touched. Can he breaks? that are taught with ear splitting noises. He's helicopter story isolates. If you ask him a question, he says his helicopter is broke. He's suggestin' activity. He rushes away to fix his helicopter. He hasn't learned to listen to anyone else's story. And stories are the way children get to know each other. In a bag out of you to keep downstairs. Yeah, I've had a hissim. Thank you. Play with them. Really? Yeah, hey Jason. Never have a day. Hey Jason. There's a lot of these trash. Yes. Children usually take part in each other's stories, because they need friends, and they want to be part of the drama. Jason would agree to be the reality. Joseph and Son. would later tell their families. Jason is my friend. It's that easy one of them. Jason, look at the bloody nail again or not. This is a recipe helicopter. Don't worry, welcome. I have six legs. I got my ginger juice. The helicopter back from rescue escape? Hell man, I must apologize you the dog. Save me your little cock for the rest of you. Save the thing. Jason is silent. Then told for his helicopter. Joseph gliers at me. His best logic is in orchard in his puzzle. I heard Joseph called for help Jason. Can you help after save the snakes? I blame him. So, both this way. Can you show Joseph in Simon how he fix it? I can't show some context. He calls the children some one. After two months he refers to no one that knew him by name. He enters the classroom and turns him through while He only partout. Taff, that he must offend himself. But every child knows this feeling in one way or another. Every day after I've collected ten or twelve stories, we have the stories out. I read each story out loud, and the children take different roles. Stage where we do this, the tape square, and the center of the story we love. It is same person, and stories are. Children learn if you often stay at the Houston Airways store. Jason refuses to follow the rule and it upset it. His motor tunes up as he'd story begin. And within a centre to he's flying around the stage. He does this as we act out Simon's story. Simon, is there a helicopter in this story? Then you mustn't come on stage Jason. Jason has heard this reason before. I asked this question all the time when four disaster Is there a helicopter in this camp? Is there a resort in the? Simon, there is a helicopter in this camp. The squirrels see a helicopter. No. , yeah, they do. Should I fly it over there? That way. Ugh. Ghost breathe, come. Turn up mower. Jason's steps, just for a sign of point, he's deliberately further at another child's store. Today, Jason's whispered. The next day I tell you, you turned off your motor when sign told you to leave. Now  all about storms. Do you want to tell them? It says yes, the launch is ready. And the helicopter, the trigger lock. It's fine. How could his first story be end-realized? In the story room, Jason zooms around a rug as I read his story. He continues to fly several moments after and... I wonder if the helicopter sees another plane. Somewhere. Which someone? Squelts up. He means, he has a plane right? Jason Narns. In the two airframe. Zoom around the room. Chains forward, arms and motion. The two boys fly together in formation. Young children see themselves always inside the story. A young child less than easily, three quarters of his family fans. It's whose stories and fantasies, children understand the world. It is their intuitive approach to all occasions. It is the way they think. Jason still plays on me. I'd want to  always accept you so much. Do you always tell me not to? I didn't tell you not to be a hard-hobb. It's time I actually come to a swirl around. And I thought you didn't hear us, do you think you'd be? Because that gorilla guy's outside the window. I'm not outside, do you think that? Jason seems to cry. that his cat is searching in the tent to response. That squirrel's got one to eat out of the house. And each, there's never one. Yes, I was in the house. I was in the house. I was in the house. Jason still doesn't play with the other show. But one day he points at Simon's. Someone's hiding in my ear. No, I'm not his name. I didn't do my ear, but you're lying to me. You're lying to me. Time is in my airport. I don't see my knee. Tell me about it. Jason, Simon doesn't want you to put you in your airport. Do you really want him to come in? Really come in? No. Jason, can I help you find someone to play inside your airport? Teachers do that, . Once I help Simon find a mother's squirrel, remember Simon? I don't want a mother's squirrel. Who do you want? Someone hiding in your mind, airport. Okay, listen every one. Jason needs someone to hide him. Hold him. Hold me if I can be the mother. It's a helicopter. I'll be the mother and you be the same. No, I'm sure I'm near the helicopter. Yes. Samantha climbs behind the wall of rocks gingerly, and sits down next to Jason. I've laid you both. Fix. We have to make that out of the helicopter's safe. Jason covers the man this place with one hand, blows on the helicopter blades. Turn around, turn around. Ooh, right such a good spin. Get that out. I don't know how he does. She has pillows and sheets. You should mix Jason into a bit. And definitely not she can. Get that out. Shhh! With this one episode, Samantha launches a whole heart of pursuit of Jason, that more than any other event in the school year brings him out of the helicopter house and into the social life of the classroom. She is determined to make Jason enter her bay, however he may object. Other times, Jason shows him unable to join the other children's video. and a secret. We wanders into a game the boys are playing. He doesn't understand what they're doing. And everyone else is gonna have to get out. Don't go to that Jason. You're prepping up the marks. We're breaking up the marks. Yeah, Jason. Don't. Mark. I'm going through an hour. Because there's no Jason. You don't even know it's school. Jason's first cry. This is also a very emotional moment. And Alex is right. Jason is interrupted play in an logical way. In a way that shows he doesn't know that a story is going here. And Alex knows enough to say, you don't know what's school is, which is to say, you don't know what stories. You don't know what fantasy. You don't know what the most logical relationship between being being easy. The story is worked by the most based logic. Logic a try on the hole. It is not too much to say that the only time child understands everything is in the store. It is the weakstass. Samantha's pursuit of chasing Rose more inventive. I am putting you in my storages. Come here and listen. I don't want to. This you have to. Or I will give you a piece of gum when I get to myself. Jason sits down next to Samantha and watches and she dictates for store. If a teacher had threatened him that one, he would have withdrawn. When Samantha threatened to see, his interest in Samantha's store was heightened. He correctly interprets her warning as a sign of French, and the story proves him correct. When Subana time there is a little girl, then a helicopter came. Then a girl said hello to the helicopter. Then a kitty says hello to them. Then the kitty in the girl left after a friend. After she's done, Jason gave her his pilot papers for his helicopter drawings. Don't try and match us. You want to be my husband? No, because I'm this, or the baby, or the cuck? Do you want to make a birthday cake? Do you want to be dead with any come alive? You never be  that time. As Samantha imagines other scenes, she doesn't notice that Jason has stopped long. That's gone. And instead, has cut out a large old wood shape. This is your cap, see? They clue. I can't. But when I glance at their blockheads or a while later, Jason seems to be the queen's baby. The Samantha continued to push Jason to the baby role because he appears baby as to her. I doubt. I've seen too many of the two are children before the baby crib and dry. Samantha's motives are increasing. She liked being the mother and she's fond of Jason to express her true feelings she must act the role of his mother. The mother baby or father baby relationship spells a love most for men for many children. By years, soon, Samantha will have moved to the big sister little sister version of the same mother. No, you go! You've put a lot of time, but we're out of the way. Once changes were being the happen fast. In one week in April, Jason is a she-baby airplane on Monday, a smaller person looking for Easter eggs on Tuesday, a morning and night boy on Wednesday, name-refighting person on Thursday. And it's Friday. He finds a remarkable new role for his helicopter that takes my breath away in admiration and wonders. I'm gonna play Jaisers? Yes, you sit there. I made a choice. Wait, I'm three seats. One more seat at least. Why? I'm going pick up someone at school because not anyone who comes to pick them up, the walk they're full. Jaisers, letting someone else into the helicopter. And when his helicopter finally emerges from its house, he gives it a single task to take a mother and her child home after school. Underlying this fantasy is a basic fear. No one is arrived to take the school child home. Child is lost school. I'm going to pick up someone at school because not anyone will come to pick them up and walk them up. We're going to hold everyone's hand. One kid's going to hold the other kid's hand. And I'm in Mom, okay? Yes, and everyone in my carehouse school and going to pick them up in right ear. I'll pick you up. Yes, you're the kid? What's your mom saying? I'm finding you for me. When you see a guy with the stars in the sky, you can bet that he's doing it for some Well, Vivian Palli's book, The Boy Who With The A Hell of Copter, from which this was adapted, was published by Harvard University Press.
