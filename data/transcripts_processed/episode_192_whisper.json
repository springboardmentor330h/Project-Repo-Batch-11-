  "text": "few years back science fiction writer and fan and Steven Golden is parent for an upcoming science fiction machine. They thought that it might ease some of the awkward situations and he had seen it for the entrance and he had asked, you just write up you simple guidelines with games on how to act and they get to meet one-on-one, some of the professional writers and they align some on. Some of his tips and some here don't delay the proud one his way to the restroom try to start a long conversation for pro is involved in another conversation may not into that weight until it breaks. And talking to a pro keep light, if you want to detail it for the softical discussion, make an appointment. Don't be a sponge, buy your fair share of drinks and meals. Quantity three different rules. Ending with the most important, don't insult, grow. Why would rules is basic is this even being necessary? Science fiction fans are usually the people who have been sort of the social outcasts when they work . growing up in school. When everyone else was outplaying sports or going to parties, the fans were in their rooms reading. And so they didn't develop a lot of the social skills. Their peers did and they grew up being introverts. And so when you get to a science fiction convention, you get a convention of introverts, which is a very strange social phenomena. Have you seen a fan's creative style of the pose to the bathroom? Yes! Well, I bring all the stuff to say that it is not just science fiction fans who need simple guidelines  these. Reading Steven Gordon's 23-Rose Online I realized to my embarrassment that if we need to get it this week's radio show, we have violated 8 of the 23-Rose. Hey, this week we visited with a variety of different kinds of pros and we monopolized their time, we interrupted, we got into detailed philosophical discussions, I didn't behave the opposite of the set that you saw which is messed up next week. See you in the next video understood with a bit, Oxfordophobia. I will also write BIMABVE tales in the comments section there you will.. .. specifically we did not take up the chat. .. F test the completely UK video and just stayed up late. By the time electronicsepherds by Loud7Sqrlive you gotta check the US app and the easiest part of the public radio international it's a American life, I'm out of glass. Today's show, we need the pros, stories of amateurs, heardling themselves at the professionals who's job they would  to have better or for worse are shown today in three acts at one crispy with a rock. The star of what is arguably the world's greatest sneaker commercial and whether it is possible for our correspondent or the grasshopper to grab the basketball from his hand. Act 2, they want to walk away. I know I went to run, which I explained how I went to the world series of poker as a reporter, came away completely obsessed with the game, reading about it, playing online, who an extent that I had not completely admitted to my own family. Until the very hour. That's me, Martha my dear. David Rackoff goes behind the scenes, Martha Stewart lived and climbed up the answer to the question. If his hobby became his job, would it still be fun? See with us. At one, crispy with the rock. This is the story of two amateurs meeting the pros. One of the amateurs, a teenager in New Jersey, the other, a correspondent, Joel Gawbel. And before we get started I should say that today's show, the first broadcast in 2001, and so the amazing TV commercial that we're talking about in this story, something that Eric back there. This is the sound of me dripping basketball. Now this is Lewis Dacelbert, who has been a fastball. Lewis is in the Nike commercial, freestyle, it's called, that ran on TV throughout the NBA playoffs this past spring. If you haven't seen it, the commercial features a bunch of NBA stars, and some WNBA stars, a bunch of streetball players. Guys with names  Speedy and A-Train and the Future, performing a series of spectacular tricks, dribbling and passing and twirling vast of alls, sort of  the Holland Club tunters, but a lot faster and a lot cooler, into this incredibly infectious hip-hop beat. So the dribbling sounds  music. In May and June, the ads were airing and pretty heavy rotation, and I found myself spending a lot of hours. watching games I didn't really care about, games involving the Indiana Pacer's friends. Just so I could see the version. Technically, there are three different versions of the app. Along two and a half minutes spot involving all the players. Then a similar shorter one. And then a 30 second spot that features only Lewis. A 19-year-old kid from Rinden, New Jersey who can do things with a basketball that, fear a serious basketball number. Well, they just make you want to die. They're so great. Linden is a working class suburb just south of Newark. Lewis's family moved here a few years ago so that he and his sister could go to a safer school. It's a nice neighborhood. The houses and lawns are well-capped. It's not at all the kind of gritty urban neighborhood where serious streetmolk players make their names. This is best in the mirror. There's always an image that's figured out in the wolves and this is  my little... apartment house. He shows me the walls of his room and they're  the walls of a lot of banking old guys rooms. There are some photos of souped up cars in one of a motorcycle and mid-glide and there are a bunch of posters of Lewis's basketball heroes. You see a lot of Ivocen, Steve Francis, and right here you got my favorite bag on the fish of Jordan and there to the right of Jordan, a full-sized color poster of Lewis. And to Jordan's lap, some one of a kind Lewis in the Marguerlion. And as actually same short-up. the commercial? I'm not a basketball star. This is the story of how Lewis, who is not a basketball star, who in fact didn't even make the starting five on high school team, ended up on the same wall beside all cycles. We sit in Lewis's living room and he tells me his story from the beginning. He's been playing basketball since he was a land when he lived in the Elizabeth New Jersey. The nearest park was pretty dangerous. and because his mother didn't want Lewis going there alone, ended up dribbling of all his own backyard. A concrete slab about the size of the twist coming. He would dribble from morning till night, watching his reflection in basement room, trying to repeat exactly the same moves again and again. His neighbors were often kept awake by his dribbling, thought he was out of his mind. My father called me and said, , suddenly, I'm coming now. My son left me a second time, he said, he gets to the third house. As a change take a try. And I will wake up the next day when some time  910 o'clock and couldn't get  4.5 hours to see back up But it was just I wanted it so bad. I wanted it so bad. I was just in my backyard. I said much I loved it. I mean nothing else mattered nothing else matters. Was it on the phone much nothing else I wasn't even concerned about going out my friends going to movies. I loved it so much. I just wanted. I wanted to film. best at what  of what I do dribbling and have did have nice his handle around nothing else matters. Nice his handle, mattest handle, do him dirty break him down. any specialized world street basketball has so much spoken by experts. And the link of sound so cool to me, but also sounds so uncool when spoken by me that I ask Lewis to elaborate on some of the phrases. Send him into a kind of hoop slang spiral in which it turns out, and LLIN decided to force Scotland's jingle music in return, Grant Bell, ZE region will only be explained by more. It's so many terms, I haven't been good handle or been crispy with the rock. It's a have a good basketball skills and good fundamentals sound with the basketball. Everybody use the breaking ankles now, having the opponent fall or they got the cowboy now. I want to let you hit and skip. Some might talk you down, broke you down, some might just want to buy you a real fast and shook you. And shook you means you play in defense, lost your footing. and this sort of look  you're doing a dance step when you should have been 20 fans. Don't make it the positive, ex-emmanicide, money, Niagara Falls, ring their games. Those are all terms for making the basket in. Louis never had a shot for Bruce. There was no way he was going to make a movie that's wrong. He was 5-10, a decent put up great ice cream. who mostly sat on the bench. thousands of other guys who played ball when they were young, Lewis's basketball faith seemed clear enough. He played the occasional pickup game, maybe join a local reclead, and years from now he'd settle into a barco-outro and watch Hoops on TV and complain about how kids these days have no respect to the game. But then one night he got a call from a friend, telling him about an audition for a not-heep more shall be very next day. Over and then half. There was a little gym on the fair floor. And yeah, we're a little German careful so we walked in. And I also used them a little bubble. I mean nobody around my area does stuff that I do. I stay in that. But then I went into a room where everybody's doing pretty much the same thing. I was doing this for living on Coke, Charlottes, Wizards, MBA players. So I turned to my father and he was , man, I didn't think it was going to be  this. I missed his eyes. I was booed. And it was  a pass before everybody was proud. around the court and I was one of the last ones. Everybody was starting to leave. The crowd was starting to go. I was actually less. I started doing my thing, my tricks. Things that most of the other guys they've never seen somebody do. Everybody started coming back in the room and showing up and getting some of my kind of good news vendors. But I was so very in the zone and there on after I was done, everybody came. of Timoeves. I was , , we're just from the look at me I had three heads and I was from Mars. I was , I knew I never seen you around and I never seen anybody do stuff you do. I had a call the next day. I was working out part-time at the local mall at least for here. We're Bridge Mall. I got on the phone and her name was Kim. She saw me at the on the the She wants to become a studio. Hang up on. Wait, you go ahead. Hang up because you thought. I thought it was somebody trying to climb. One of my friends trying to pull a prank. Because if it was really hard, then she would be , why did you take a poll? So she calls again and she says, you must get this connect. She said, I was going with that. I guess it is for real. So then she found the fact that she came to the... ...the coffee studio's in the story points. Tuesday, A by thought you were the best one and they want you for this commercial. They want you for this commercial March 20th and I think as one of the best days of my life Other guys came all eight train came on Chris Franklin that was when we've been in the ball on the floor Also, Peebee Kirkloan was there. I mean the street he's a speed diplomat with basketball We started crossovers and and all that jacky the famous gold trotler So it was all I mean I'm in a room awful celebrities and players that I can up  inspired by and want to be  enjoy the style of basketball. We had a little water break and I'll actually be curting. He actually got up off the seat and shook my hand and said  I've been in my lot of basketball players and seen a lot of things but I never seen  somebody do stuff you do in there. Yeah it was awesome. to me. Yeah, Baron Dave is real cool. He came to say, he's , , he's , you got attention to someone. It's stuff. I was , I was , I teach somebody to do me a favor and pull it off. Somebody games and he started laughing. He got he got hand. Paul Pierce though, that's my man, but he could have been the bull around his fingers. His life dependant on it. He was so hard against in the pot. There's top and he sees it. He's got a little bit of a snake. He's got too much of the best boasts. He started bobbed his head to the music. He's got the dancing around the ball. He's still on the music. A couple of months later Louis was out driving around. We got a call from one of the guys. He's , , look, look, hold me on. He's , look, he's pretty much his own right now. He's , , he's , you're so hot. He's , hold on. every commercial break, commercial school, and commercial school,  eight, nine times. Every time they put in the timeout, commercial school, and they got won just with you. I said, yeah, I thought he's, yeah, right, South-Cloud. I thought he was, yeah, right, South-Cloud. I thought he was, yeah, right, South-Cloud. I thought he was, yeah, right, South-Cloud. But I didn't see it. So I believe it was a bit late. But when I seen it, how was it? Me, I had a smile. I wasn't too much, I was, I was, I have a small amount of hazelnut, but inside I was on the soul lit up, I was in Manit. I can't believe it's can't believe it's can't believe it. I came out to Lewis's house with a tape of commercial in my dad. I wanted to watch it with Manit himself. Had him described to me in detail what we're not in the day of the shot, yeah. Star and all of the commercial, future, blissful things. That was daddy, and that was me right there. Everybody thought that was can't be taken from the... that they really do that. It's a little difficult to stay in cars, Lewis, Washington, really. I mean, I don't want to sound  a corporate black or anything. But I think this commercial is just about the greatest thing that has ever been on television. It kicks the moonman's exams. I also don't want to get too enthusiastic about something that ultimately exists to sell sneakers. But there's just no denying the way the commercial captures best in all's pure improvisation of you. There's one trick Lewis does, it's a little hard to explain that earlier. But it involves in capturing the ball between his elbows and more. back in such a way that the ball seems to vanish in here. For first time I saw it, I thought it was dark, but it was. I thought it was , yeah, it looks  the ball is just  on a straight angle. It's incredible. Thank you. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. This past month, Lewis went to Taiwan with a few other guys in the end. To promote a street basketball event called Hip-Hoo. The Nike commercial had just started running the Taiwan. And he wasn't really prepared for how he'd be created. In the airport outside of Taipei, Taiwanese customs officials approached him and the other guys, pointing at them and dribbling imaginary basketballs, saying freestyle, freestyle, over and over, and repeating the rhythm of the at-squeak sneakers. Lewis has a pilot snap shot, so he took on the streets of Taipei to record the fusion of his celebrity. They had posters and billboards and they all over Taipei, and I was even the shot I was taking pictures. where I would turn, there'd be another poster of me. They had Ashley Bassville ports all every part of my face on. Yes. So here you are. Looks  it's about 15-5, it's supposed to. Yeah. I gotta ask you about one specific move. You hold the ball on your hand and you go as if you're throwing it towards the camera. And then somehow the ball rolls back on your hand. I'm just , you can throw the ball forward,  it's going to go the ball back. spin back and you try to stop but you do one hand so it's  the most. Lewis can explain to me all tricks he wants but what he can't really put into words when I ask him is what it's to go so quickly from selling high east to look a mall and more of a one-on-one is there enough room for your toes kind of way. To traveling halfway around the globe to a place where photos of him dominate entire city blocks and what I can explain is the effect this commercial was had on. I've watched it dozens, maybe even hundreds of times. I keep trying to do tricks. to my house that go badly around and eat dirty basketball and bring some of the walls. We're going to do a sign that you guys told me to show up. The whole thing I want you to do. Eventually Lewis takes me and is back yard to play a little one-on-one. I have to admit it's the moment I've been born. 35 years old, a husband and father in total square, and I'm about to play ball with the kid who has the maddest animal. He starts showing me a couple of trips and then starts dribbling the ball around, could nature late challenging me. steel. I take a couple of half-hearted spikes and Lewis taught me little, dribbling the ball right for a lesson in arms  the way. And that's why I have this weird, slightly confusing pen. I start thinking, what if I steal the ball? I've played a lot of basketball at my lunch, and we're in this tiny space that's about the size of a party's clock. There's actually a chance that I'll be able to take your away from you. Or that I'll look kind of  a child, if I can't get a hand on or at least once. But then Lewis begins to dribble the ball faster and faster. Sweat stains the shirt and beads on space, and his hands move so quickly they look wild birds. He flutters the ball along the ground in front of me, then makes it rise up one arm and roll down the other.

You're writing at different kinds of stuff. stories on this new. Today's program, meet pros, stories of aspiring amateurs, dropping in on the big leads. Leave a ride to that two of our programs. Actu, now in the walk away, now in the run. In May of 2001, one of the then producers of our radio show, Sterley kind and I went to Las Vegas to watch the World Series of the Poker with his guy named Jim McManus. McManus is this novelist who had gotten sent to the world series of Poker to cover it by Harper's Magazine. the year before, and as part of his coverage, he entered the turn, playing poker. Now usually, whenever a porter does a stunt  this, he's not that of the competition pretty fast. man, as, if a porter I was , but I'd never actually played in tournament with professionals. He didn't fit. If, out of a 500 entrance, if we'd come with a quarter million dollars in prize money. So anyway, Jim was introducing Starly and I around to the various people who you're been here in this next story. who make their living's playing poker. Some of these people, by the way, have completely well known in the poker explosion attacking the Earth on TV and online, all over the country, since we could destroy back into the last one. So, talking to this poker pros, and during one of the interviews, I was asking somebody a question about how much money they need, or how many days a week do they work? And jam, it's been less involved in interviews, interrupts to tell the person who we're talking to, you have to understand, I received an email, I received an email. considering leaving his job, play poker for him. And up into the moment he said that, that thought had not fully formed in my head. And as soon as he said it, I realized he was completely right. There was a part of me that was working on this question, should I leave my job to go play poker for a minute? Even though I don't even play poker, , I have to oftentimes in my life. Watching these people play cards all day for their jobs, it just seems so much better than any child by it ever. see or imagine. And the tricky thing is, it doesn't look that hard. , it's not pro basketball. It's not  hitting a passball  Alex or E. Guess. you can't be that. But poker, it's just hard. , it's only hard. How hard do that be? And so I spent a lot of time talking to people who had mastered the game. My future colleagues trying to figure out it's in fact it seemed a little They seem just  you and me. But somehow they had figured out. Not only had to be other people, but how to be black itself. , to what do we are they to regular people? What do you do they have a kind of suit? this one. My mother started teaching me how to play cars when I was five. And then I have a really big family and a really close family. And we used to always , when I was eight, nine, ten years old, just play poker, , for pennies. 20m, Jim Harmon had been making her living in the proper fire for 13 years. Grouping me now, she was in her third east. I don't do a bunch of dogs. And then I said, do you see what I'm saying? She seems  anyone . Until she starts telling stories  this next one. About how, when she was 12, her dad would have that perfect game's now in there. And if he started losing three or four or five hundred dollars, she'd be a lot to play. He would put me in the game for him to get his money back. And I remember sitting with these guys, it seemed  ancient. because I was only 12, 13, and thinking, wow, these guys have no idea what they're doing. I'm gonna take your money. Just I'd watch people's movements, and I'd watch them how they bet their hands, and just the whole psychological thing about it. They bet, and I'd be saying to my mind, , he doesn't have anything. Just all that kind of stuff. I think I always got my daddy, even. I don't remember a time. I didn't get it even. winning 500 backs a lot of money. You're getting it allowance. That's 16 gen started playing in the C-NOS after college after studying to go to medical school. You started playing full-time. Procuse your job. You set your own hours. Choose with days to play. Gen says it'll be the perfect job in just kids. Right now, her daily routine does  this. Wake it noon, 1, 2, hang out in the afternoon. Play with dogs, run errands. study at how you've changed some husband as a parent. Sometimes between 7 and 9 and 9, few nights a week, she drops into the casino, see if there's a game or a start again. Gen play is somewhat a probably the most expensive card games in the world, in the poker room that allows you to see no en las Vegas. She has up no season 9. I'm gonna go to the box and eat money. The casino gives hard-core players  Chan, safe deposit boxes, in the room next to poker room. Maybe I'll get a one- offline version. She gets $40,000 in chefs. She only needs 15,000 for this team, but she's helping the big-rook game starts off. Let's start something, Freddie. Let's start something. You broke me, Freddie. Oh, no. Sorry to break you. Here's something I never would've guessed. People Jen plays with, mostly other professionals. Same people, over and over, night after night. And then we go out afterwards. have a drink or a bowling or a go to dinner. So you guys are all pros and basically just taking a picture of yours. Yes. Well there's usually  one or two people that aren't experienced and are from out of town or are our business people that aren't as experienced and they actually supply the game for everybody to make good living. Apply the game. Adeleth, the way to say big news. Turns out they're all in a lot. Very rich guy. who would thrill in playing against Western World. Some nice who game has minimum bet, thousand dollars, other nights, it's $1,500. But one bet. It's not unusual for Jim who was $100,000 in the single night. It's  normal to leave a big mouth. But , it's hard getting to this frame of mind, because the first time I lost $3,000, I went home and cried  maybe. And I said, oh my gosh, it's the biggest loss I've ever taken in my life. When I lost $3,000, I lost 10,000. Same thing. When I lost 30,000, I can sleep for four years. When I lost 100,000, the first time in my life, I can sleep for a week. But then the next time I lost 100,000, and in the next time I lost 100,000, it's  your pain threshold just goes up. Jan is made enough playing cricket. She bought a new house, huge house with no mortgage. She used road to check. played her level, she says she's not comfortable with that 2 million as a bankroll. My spoke of her professionals needed to say, play for lower stakes and make less money. A lot less money. As many different players were they made at the very beginning of their careers, and the answer was usually about $150.9. Coincidentally, about the same as Casino de-worst me. As you'd expect, progress the kind of job where health insurance is sort of a problem, even jam, dollar money, still on a family policy, to a parent. And how much skill does a person need? How much is lack of factor in all this? Consider this story. At one point during the World Series of Poker, a pro named Indy Johnson, standing just a few feet away from the pre-bossed. Cardboard out. The World Series of Play-A-Con and Poker-Caution hexes old up, for each player just gets two cards, two steps down, and then five cards come face up in the middle of the table, everybody share. And the cards go around, and Gions' 20s name, all for what makes the first bed on the hand. $1000. Kind of push. had in some buses cost bed since $7,000 was his own. The deal with them lays out the first three-piece up cards. They call it the flop, the middle of table, Linda, he's in Lennak-China. The flop comes, we, nine, three, call that all in, all at least as a bear I believe. I would think he has a queen. One bedding happens, which would go over their cards. Oh, actually has a pair of aces. The other guy is a pair. 9. Which? Blind with a 9 with sitting on the table, face up, is Mesaft 3 not. 3 of the kind needs parent poker. It's a Paul who's his name. I can't believe it. 4. I'll see you all the time. Sick about this one. That's supposed to be this one. Oh, it's $20,000. Very next hand. Each player gets two cards face down. There's a query. Paul's amazing. Profile brother. Yeah. We've got some action here. But in the first 7,000, Daniel called 7,000, Tony D. Re-Rased. He made it almost 80,000. Paul just moved all in. Now we remember Paul got two A's, eight last time. Much about the people drop out, they didn't just two people in hand. Paul and Gaining Tony D. Each of them has 72,000 dollars in pot. He's every last chapter in D. First Tony D. couldn't bear any more even if he wanted to. They each flip over their two feet. down cards. 20D has two jouts. Paul has two aces. Again, then the quadcom and another card. And then the last card. It's Jack. It's Jack. It's a magical bag of fantasy. He's been in the back of the back of the head aces. Once again, it's nice. Once again, it's Jack and both times they hit their miracle, make three nights and three jacks. So, Elysses, two pots in a row for a lot of money. That's the... That's a brutal beat. So, oh my god. Oh, oh my god. Oh, I'm going to turn with this per piece of tubing. I'll just add a feel sick about this. I'll stand in that place. He's in pain. So there's a lot of character in the brief. I do. I'll walk off the floor. Anyone who says there's no likeness to this. You have to listen to it. You hand's later. I'll just ask the rest of the show. This friend will just take this medium and see the clock. What can you do? It's part of the game. It's part of the game. It's really... It's hard to describe. When I saw that jacket the table, it was... I couldn't even see that. I went blind for it. It was ... It's a good thing to put in actually a Jack. It's as if you saw just something materialized out of thin air. And then said that by Lace laws of physics, that couldn't have just happened. We would have this ball there. Just appear in part of my face. That's how that Jack is. Just simply couldn't have. Then standing in the box is that notes have for people who are calculating the odds that a person could get. Well, the odds are getting a pair of aces. Look at the first card, it's four out of 52, which is one of 13. The next card, one out of 17, because there's three left. Great, a little bit fewer. 13, 17 is 221. So it's 220 to one against getting a S. And then it's 220 to one against getting an X-Tant. So we're looking at over 40,000, because 200 square to be 40,000. So then we've got the odds of me having a S' cracked back, or as you call, four and a half squared, which is about 18. We've got 18 times 45,000. So right around a million. As well as it's definitely in the millionaire ballpark. What happened to me? We call a one in a million feet. This is the sort of moment to make the aspiring and the player for certain costra and fright. But all the things that professionals have on their pedals. And then just the odds and the odds. There too. lled蹲 intensify and go into satellite with cards. And the most notice of the thing about watching her play is that  a great ball player , she does not see much as crying very hard. All at the same time she is watching the other players, figuring out what they have, calculating the odds in her bets, ordering hot tea, nothing in interview, chatting about her upcoming trip to Italy, making her own bets. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Cancels have made difference between low-stakes games and higher-stakes games she plays at. Is that the better player? with higher money levels, play way more psychological game. Here's the thing he's talking about. One of the guys in this game doesn't think much when players. He's on the worst player in the world. I don't play well, I get the cards and I win with them and I'm just lucky. He just hates losing no girl. He just drives him crazy. He just can't see. He can't see. When he plays, it has been  that for years. And so, in one hand, he has a terrible card. And then this guy raises the bed over and over. She bets him back and she only wins in the end with a lucky last She collects the chipset she's won one of guys He points in my microphone and yes, you played that hand at the guy had a video camera with him Wasn't a very good hand. Let's put it down. I was just wondering what would she play? The reason why I should play a hand  that has to do with that guy. He doesn't think that women play good poker She wants him to keep thinking she doesn't know what's his story That makes him make your own decisions Stan hands that he should never stay I was supposed to win that hand he had buried aces. I had a dead three And he was so much more of a favorite than I was but But I also knew that I'd make more money in the future from him if I play that him So if I lost the pot I take a small loss for how much I'm going to make in the future because we think that I play those kind of hands against them all the time. So, it's  putting myself in a negative equity situation to make more money in the future. Any poker pros we met have no interest in other times. They don't exactly look at poker as kind. Others gamble compulsively. I'm not sure it's a stop. One of the best poker players is known to take as winnings, blow them into the craft state. Doing the world series poker wanted to do. breaks, producer-starly kind enough, still good, Bill, getting this part of life, that's on genrami, that's on privy, that's on golf, that's on backgammon, I love gambling, , all gambling or anything, oh yeah, well it's a small, less thing you've ever fed on, well I've lost 5000 hours in rock scissors paper last weekend, grab 2,-іт-pity minra, F$113,2000, to you to this guy This diet is that the spring gray travels everywhere with them. Free floating vacation slash gambling trip that never ends. Great, somehow outthink and outscadage us bill in Rocks' paper. We've been playing Rocks in this paper for 10 years. And you see, I've seen all the moves. You think that there's just Rocks' as a paper. But when someone goes papers, five times in a row, and you're , okay, I know what he's doing next time. He's going paper. He's trying to suck her man to think he's going scissors. So you go Rock. And he goes paper again. It really can put you on the most serious tilt. The describes the strategy of Rocks Paper. And really, it's just  poker. He says, we have three possible options. One game is called Raise of Cold. And the other is Rock, scissors of paper. And how both are second. And before I know it, I'm in the casino bar and feel his rock scissors papering Starley for a drink. She just got paper, or scissors called that paper. Which tends to be... to believe that she's going rock next. Just to do the whole the full gamut of moves. But that might be too obvious for us. So she might double reverse me. Okay, I'm gonna go rock. Hey, you better win. I'm gonna go rock. I'm gonna go rock. I'm gonna go rock. People step place inside that. You can build up right to the Sterely's eyes. The stairs going to go rock. And just hold them inside to rock. A promise. Specially gets us looking at the faces. Is he going rock? Wait, is he? One, two, three. Oh! He goes rock, he goes his. I'm all juice, I want to do it. And see how kids get hooked? I'm going right for my computers. I have this one published internet in an industry story. You need dollars. You need to work. And then at the good case for why, even a choice of doing anything in the world, one might decide to play poker. It's a great life, Phil says. Good luck. field chip with your friends, flying around the world, flying cards. And hearing him in rap described it is really  listening to the devil. Telling you to quit your job, don't heat the advice of your loved ones, turn your back on everything you have ever fought for or helped me or come and live forever on the island of the lost boys.

Well, Janet Fillan, Paul, I'll still love playing guitar. There are guys  this on time, David's playing. My name is Mike Lang, L-A-I-N-J. I'd always told me the I, he's for aint tell us. If you're playing for so long, how fun is it just  a job? I do. Every minute. I'm going to go to the shop. So time I get up off my couch. Where I go taking showers. Is it a job? I don't feel ... getting a water, wash my hair and take them to shower and get the rest of the stuff on the snap. Going out of the water. That's when the work began. Mike says it when he's playing poker. It is literally boring for him. John Chess draw these 20 something poker pros. He's smart about the money and managing risks. Mike is old school. He never had a book done. Why read him? He plays against guys who wrote the books. He's kind of gambled who recently that $24,000. Whether it's cool. point, but in the air, come up hits your pal. One. That's part of a gap. , that is the next month's overall. That's the way it goes. It goes off and it goes down. Do you have a bank roll that you keep to protect you for, , a month or two months? You always, well see, a lot of guys keep their bank roll, the gambling bank roll, and their spending bank roll. Me, it's  my bank roll is my burden. Whatever I have, it's always up for drows. Awesome, if a coin is for it or whatever. So you'll let yourself go broke. Well, yes. the heart to risk everything. If I think he's laughing on his move-in-off, I'll just first get everything. It doesn't matter. If you get broke, you get broke. You just go on the next day. I think Mike was walking by his 11-year-old son home. It's playing poker online. Mike knows his son had a killer hand. That's possible card. Then he didn't even even have it. That's what happened. Mike suggested that his son raised. Since it now, I don't want to lose the gun dad. Meaning, he didn't want to get broke. It's a string of... get more of his money. I'm thinking 11 years old to pick up this mango and realize this. I mean, , you got potential to be a great poker player, but I mean, it'd be nice for him to have that as a hobby and a secondary player. But I'd  that one to college, , be a doctor or something. I mean, and would you be sad if he became a professional poker player? I don't want to manage. I don't want to manage. I mean, , I got a lot of friends over the world. And I got a lot of respect in friends over the world. And he never met a friend. And he'd hear stories of his dad. I'm sure that. I mean, I put some stories out there. Not meaning to it, but I put out a lot of stories that people we talked about for the years. After I'm gone. But I want to ask myself now to fall back on, but he knows gonna be there. How could we have lost you? It's built into the job that experienced players who don't lose in streaks that last months. No player can win. Think about what that does. Me. with your kids, your wife, whoever you're with and your irritable, even what the talk to you, you don't want to talk to, , you kind of flat the hand of the hand of the hand, , I'm sorry,  what I mean? Excuse me. what's supposed to all bounce out, but it's , , you think God why? Why is it got a bounce up now? Why can't a bounce out a little bit later? Not so strong,  what I mean? what I mean? So, whenever we wrote with Jen Harmon, she won $16,000 in $2,000, but she spent most of the last three months to make huge losing straight. She says it doesn't worry, because it knows what it changed. When she first started kind of, it was definitely going to be playing seriously when you're in a half, which went on a seven month losing straight. You doubt yourself. I tried not to change my game, so the worst. And a lot of... poker players, that's why poker is so difficult and so many people can't be successful is because they go through these losing tricks and they start to play really bad. They've really changed their game for the worse. I mean you have to be robotic and that's very difficult to do. Yeah, I  that. I don't know how many times I've said. No, I'm just a robot. Why can't I be a robot? No motion at all. So you get track of the wins and losses and three of the 13 is just quite... He took a loss. He's gone broke once, nearly gone broke the second one. This is our very sobering news for the aspiring passionate. I find this hard to put him down. Even though playing to his last few months it's clear that I don't have a special gift for me. I don't have a piece of it. I get bored waiting for a good man. And then play all kinds of cards I really shouldn't fold him. This is Gossney, I think. I'm a bit of money. Another weakness in mind. I find him up. more interested in knowing whether people are lying. Then I am a winning man. So if I have a pair of bases and then something that's raising the that's the straight trips or something to eat my asses, the right thing to do with your whole. But kind of I  to plot myself into a reporter waiting scene, kicks in and then I simply want to know if the bluff. So I stay in. , sometimes, showing how people smell the thing, problems happen. That is more interesting to be in the winning the money. Australia says that when I say  this and basically girl,  watching sports with the personalities rather than caring about who is going to be in. So I stand there almost never going to. There's that two weeks ago started lying about money. I'm telling people that I'm down about $150 total for all this poker, but really it's more  300. 200. Okay, Street Fit. Let's be head, right? The line. Past gen permanent, how many hours in amateur  me would take to get competent at poker? Do you think surmum it and then says 2000? 2000 hours? Think of that. That's  a 40 hour week job for a year. They only have 19-year-old videos to go. Act 3. Mike Maydew. What David Rackoff is our third amateur today, and which we said that on the quest to meet the pros, get it, questions. I have a cupboard doing my living room. A free-sanding armwired that holds, among a ton of other stuff, the following supplies. Six stamp pads, rubber line-only imprinting blocks, seven boxes of Chinese flashcards, and a factory fabric sample book from the garbage of the carpet and tiles for our 20th acrylic paint. in 1880, they 42, rhinestones, pro-button's, architectural bolso wood pipe cleaners, and a tin cracker box of golf keys, quantity approximately 1000 assorted colors. I'm Axt. Boxes, lamps, mirrors, small folding screens painted jackets for kids that are okay. It's what I do in my spare time. Some people need to exercise every day. My salvation lies in time spent alone with an exacter, and commercial grade adhesive. During the active making something, I experienced a kind of blissful absence of the self and a loss of time. I almost cannot get the feeling any other way. Certainly it never happens in my job, in writing. When seated at the computer, I have to either check my watch, eat something, call the friend, or abuse myself every 10 minutes. By contrast, I once spent 16 hours making 150 wedding invitations by hand, and was not for one incident of that day, tempted to check. the target. Is it possible for one's job to be an exercise in half of that feeling or does the act of doing something for money automatically robbed you of that feeling? For me, it was only one place where I could sign the answer. The crafts, artman, of Marcus to admit, magazine. This is Relaxy. the monkeys first but ever met. My voice is squeaky in Hannah Millman's office. Hannah is the editor who heads up the craft department and her workspace has me greed and greed. There is the requisite desk with talent from that computer. But beyond that, it's just an impact we just have tasks and cards and cards. Rumors of the public area jar us with with sea shells, bags of compacts, courts, polished oyster shells, been to meet with dry installers of revenue. and self-flowers, it is an establishment. Did you blow these eggs yourself or did you get them together? Ah, on one of the shelves is a series of decorated eggs that have been sold open with the tiny bit as a Dremel Drill painted hinged altered and adorns in innumerable variations of operas. Hannah explained that these were created in house for a feature the magazine did on how to make her own saver J.H. We'll need the costume story one of our projects with. which made a plastic drawstring garbage bags. Black juice, which was found object. So the last thing was no show costume. The requirement is that they could not be selling. We're giving them  a problem. That's a great idea. So I went to go look from garbage bags and as everybody here does, you search for the perfect garbage bag with the right color drawstring and just the right sheen. So I was shopping and I thought there must be something else in the supermarket that would work. Whoosh you? costume and it wasn't really coming to me but there were the coffee filters and I thought those could be those Elizabethan cops are on your wrist. I'm gonna buy these or something they were on my middle class. Turned out it was the perfect material. We have congregated in the main work room. The project is coming. the other way is not surprisingly Christmas or. Stops of wheat are insoked, folded, twisted, braided, entied into an endless variety of shades.

They are went to art and design school, they also need to love their jobs, and they seem to love them. for a reason that's very familiar. Do you ever, when you're making something, do you ever achieve this state of mind where you've lost? You've lost in the morning. You get really flush in the stage. You go into a deep level of concentration, really, is what it's all about. Think, you really do. You have to be able to concentrate really deeply to the point where you don't even the point where you don't even, realize you're not self-conscious about what you're doing and more. It's just blowing up. The actual name for the state of mind that Kelly is describing is called flow. It's a term you may have heard of without knowing where it came from. It was coined by the psychologist, Mihai Chixin. For those of you not a Hungarian descent, let me say a French Mihai Chixin Mihai. Chixin Mihai interviewed athletes, chess players, artists, rock climbers, and found that old. when engaged in the act of their choosing, spoke of reaching the level of engagement that is completely out of self-conscious, removes them from their everyday worries, and altars, they're sensitive. So I think the biggest challenge for us is that you have to have this, you have to have  instaplow. , you have to, you have to make it. You don't have choice. That's what you're paid for. , that's what your job is. So, as I've have that corrupted while in your life. When something becomes from evocation to vocation, from the thing that you love to do, the thing that you may still very well love to do, but the thing that you paid to do, and you still create it for yourself. Yes, you can, yes, you can, but it takes a lot of discipline. It takes a lot of discipline to keep. You can't just sort of do it when you feel  it. dream of her. I can't work here. I just don't want to spend that kind of effort to get to a place that I can get to without any work at all. Under that kind of pressure, I'm not even sure I can get there in the first place. To paraphrase that famous old saying, don't slap where you proud. Talking to these women, I do realize I have this income. We all mixed. We give mercy to the way. gifts. But for the most part, none of us seem to have a terribly clear idea of what happens to all of that. I have made and given away years and years for things, starting in earnest at least 15 years ago. Some of it to people who have moved almost that many times. This has gotten divorced or been ridowed. I've made things out of soup, polyurethane food, but soup nonetheless. My hypothesis is that a lot of the things I've made spend a year in me  straighten' out of the shelf and whatever things uży дальше. time to rubbish heat for the goodwill or a box in the face. I decided to just my fear. Hello? Yep? Yeah. Good say, please. Hey. I have a question for you. You're being recorded right now. , do you remember that birthday? , I might be in your 30th birthday? Do you remember, , what I made you? Yeah, I have a ring here. Good. do? Yeah. I'm surprised that there's still a lot. Especially because what is it? It is a wooden transformed cigar box and it painted very lovely pastel shade and that it covered in neco-wish. There's a top of celery. It turns out that she wasn't the only one who could describe I call my friends James, Laura and Margaret. They also kept the things I've made for her. Not just kept them out in their daily lives, on their bedside tables and their hallways, on their children's backs. In between phone calls, I post more than with my producer Alex Bloomberg. He recorded all of this calls. He wasn't surprised at all that my friends could just stop. Because they love you and hear your friends in there,  clearly, you're all very close and... , they're gonna  keep everything you keep them because they  it. Alright, what did you do? What did you do with the little line of time that I left on you guys? That's it. What did I do? I've got to get this up. I've got to find it now. You don't have to find it now. I knew this was a thing. You're really down to the bottom of the desk. Here's a thing. On some level, I actually don't really care what happens to the things. So long as what doesn't happen is the following, which is that 20 years' end. when these people are sitting around with their families, their new families, their children that these sort of mythology of the object is not, oh this was given to us by that sad, lonely loser. She wrote a meaner, I was , oh he made a this thing but he came for our wedding and got so drunk. Alex really should be feel bad. It's a lovely moment when I give somebody something in their appreciative to be sure, but in some ways, their reaction is beside the point. How make things anyway? On some level, me giving somebody something that I've made is almost the equivalent of your fitness not friend coming into your living room, dropping and giving you 25 and then shouting, happy birthday. Who's really gotten the gift of satisfaction  that? You tell me. David Rackoff is the author. Most recently, the book Don't Get Too Comfortable.
