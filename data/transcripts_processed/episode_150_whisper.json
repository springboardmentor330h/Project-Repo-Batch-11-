And when he got there, there's no dancing and goofing around. Everyone just sat around a clock. But it doesn't kids. Casual drinking beers. Just talking. I don't remember exactly what we were talking about. I remember it was all very quiet and people say, not what we were talking. Endoing is very grown up party. I'm  any ad of it ever been to it. A couple got up and I threw them in the spot. At some point I realized that they were in the bedroom for quite some time that they do our clothes. It was the door closed. And I mean I, , 16, I'm kind of, , nobody was giggling, nobody was observing this fact. Nobody was making mention of this. I mean it was just what adult. Let's do it. It was just this is what we do at a party. After all the going girl locked in the bedroom to the bathroom and they shoured to get. Then the boy wearing a Terry-Coff-Baccro. We joined the party. And as Adam went to more parties with this crowd, this would happen a lot. A couple would go off, have sex, and then return to the party all the way. Well, everyone acting  this is no big deal at all. At that time, did you think, okay, this is the way that dogs act? Yeah, it was also mysterious. I would have kind of bought anything about those things, ? And I didn't really, it seemed to me  this is how such a sophisticated adult, the crucial thing is, nothing was a good thing. Nothing was worth. But why would you leave prematurely, Blasay, that sets? Priority in a kid is wanting to be a grown-up already. And throughout childhood, from a very early age, you try on various adult-in-hates, besides you're her being a adult, long before you get to part of your current. And sometimes, in these rehearsals, you just get it wrong. Today on our program, stories of kids trying to act  a adult. sometimes by the run choice, sometimes because they have no choice and what to get right and wrong. WB is Chicago, public radio and international, to American life on our glass. At one of our program today, I was a teenage ambulance driver in which we asked the question, can it be good for you as a kid to see some things that you just don't want to see. I too, has not been to 12. Story of two brothers to see. and how one ended up doing the cooking and cleaning for the other. Act 3, the miseducation of Josh Frank, in which an average American 17 year old explains why it's okay to ignore everything you're supposed to  about high school and start your career in the big city. My four angry young man, times two. What it's  to be a teenager, sent to a maximum security prison, and what it's  to be an adult. Working, getting back. knowing you could be me. Stay with me. EQUIEN, I was a teenage ambulance driver. My patternedity has this story that takes place way back in the late 20th century. I was a teenage ambulance driver. My Connecticut hometown people thought it might be wise to put their suburban youngsters to get used. And so post 53, the youth ambulance established. We, the acne-play, dumb-chilling, fierce-neakened generation to be, thought this was remarkably wise. When did you were bumping your back wheel over the curb, nervously trying to parallel park over at the D&D? In the next, you were commanding several times at Bucking Red Siren emergency love, screaming  a band down the intersting. And everybody, everybody, is curtsy and swarming up on and over to let you pass. You check in these strobes, dude. Adios suckers. The Post was housed in old railroad stations to shook any time a metro north-trended Dubai of Guayda Manhattan, but back to New Haven, and there we were the secret Cabal of 50 or so high school kids, girls and boys, most of us achievers of one kind or another, most of us on a path to college. The way from the Post we might drink or spot pop, this didn't yield young flash, on a call, there was none of that. There were usually four of us riding engines, EMC. go for the driver and often an adult supervisor. The occasionally the supervisor was just a more experienced high school senior. We dressed in white button down shirts and white pants with fluorescent orange jackets. It's cool we carried big clunky pages, sometimes we were called from class or spawned cars or a stroke or whatever else might be going along with human body. The person responsible for our teenage ambulance service, the post, was a celebrated man in town named Bud Dobel, who had a habit of calling each and every one of us booby, and usually not as a term of a determined deerman. What the hell do you think you're doing booby? Who would roar? Did anyone tell you we're dealing with human lives here? You kept us on the straight narrow, are very unpat. We, his boobies, attended endless training sessions where we learned to do our job. military efficiency. Our lives revolved around the soil treat the station, cluttered with styrofoam coffee cups in our backpack strewner and every corner. On duty until midnight would hang out waiting for a call, get pizza, flirt. We weren't expected to be at home in the beauty of it, but all of this pizza eating, flirting, and teenage beefing around, the sanctioned by the self-deceptor were making not the half of our town . There were times when we felt a little  you were getting away just to take the rest of our Other times you weren't so sure. Once I got a beeper call to a classroom at my own school. My physics teacher, who was full of wacky bluster during 15 minutes of spent the each day, took exceptionally many scrolling sea-lines top of pop quiz after you bought. Stittleone in his lab, trembling, is nose bleeding uncontrollably. Bright red blood streaking his white turtleneck  Chinese characters. You see more to find. Both by what was happening and by who it came to have. Later when he was back to his healthy self, learning his fast knowledge, physics , I would sit in the class, particularly grueling Dave, who making his feels small. We flashbacked that moment when he stood covered in blood and I don't know. I'm not proud to say it's kind of hard work. The teenageward lions based on the fact that adults are dangerous, that they control you and can get you in trouble. The teachers, cops, and even your parents are not liking it, anyway, but are different species altogether. What happens when you're put in a position where they're suddenly weak, new sudden, have the power. Can you ever go back to being a teenager again? Once late on a week, I was on another call outside of the bar on the Main Street of our town. We arrived and now was down by the shoulder of the roads. struggling to get up. He'd been hit by a car. He was dirty and drunk, slurring his words. He was clearly hurt, probably had some internal bleeding, though adrenaline blew his Winston to his spine. Remember holding a flashlight and shining on, and then saying, get that fucking light off. I'll be damned if I'm gonna have a kitty dust. To my surprise, who was my old swim coach, some of his generosity and for us. said he, I'm pulled death, shape me, early years, this woman. And now I hadn't seen him in a few years, he was someone I'd return. Coach I said, this might pattern to you. I was one of your swimmers. I'm not going, he said, don't touch me. Listen, Coach, I think it'd be best if it came. I think he ain't go fuck yourself, said. I was one of your swimmers I said, and you're hurt. Try to focus for me. My name didn't register. and why shittered him. He'd been thrown headfirst into an embankment had a tough assad and willingly stuck to his head the sad beret. Get away from me, said, for a make you hurt. Make me hurt. It seemed to bizarre things to say, but I backed off. Signed a waiver that he was with these and treatment. We left him there. Broken and beginning to sob when I turned my back. I remember being confused by that. By his bullidger. and some vulnerability, by the way, who's so pretty not the man I want to study was, the man I'd be some hope on, and some sense in my own cell. And I knew that he wasn't sobbing because he can fat, or or strong. Something else led him to this moment that he didn't even try to ponder. One of my brothers, Steve, was in post 2, and after I left for college, he'd keep pazer. kind of big deal. So he briefly ended up as the widest angel. My brother was actually more of a rebel than I was in his place. Recently asked him what he remembered in the time. The outfits said, laughing. You started training stories about the pause, but not. why I remember that I had the three memories in dreams I've been facing. That's even up in the fire. You better my little girl. by your Cabinetoken earning the 어떤 ofTH, that is new which is just when the sheer landspray was built, made by their Prime Minister's leader. He gave a T gearbox. With his mother who he was You're very nervous. when you can see me, I was in the interview. This just the sky had to have driven by, stopped, super-fulled, and grabbed the four-year-old, and wrote them out of the car, which was something that's stupid, but it didn't get neck-in-fruits, and it came running over to me with this, into the door. So I had, I had, , that grabbed the kids, they took my hands, my arms were taking me to the house, and then down. My mother was in nursing, she could just tell me. just ten minutes long to tell the nurse and I know this is serious. So my brother had to figure out what to do. There were no obvious broken bones or aspirations, which made the situation altogether mohams. He suspected that there might be severe entranments, and so they need to get the kids to ask them to fast. I remember saying little fingers, he was stiff and just a little rhythm to grab. Excuse the tape. And then, do that. Just put into the context of this. This is up to me here, maybe, as it turned out, he ended up dying. That's what he'd mass it. And this is what he'd mass. I also remember, I got to the hospital and he always slept in the morning. One of the people who were talking about, so, why didn't tell us if it was this kind of... In July, the head of the road ahead of me. Where you in Toronto Center set off and stuff, I was at. At that point. I didn't tell anything she told me. We used to five minutes to put a six out of five. This is... that's... I told him to look in and saw. I don't know. I said that they came, and swelling over his head, whether or not I sufficiently flagged the forum, I felt awful. It was pretty hard to do with the photo one. You don't have a flow? The more you do and wonder, the better the more we can silence you. In fact, he didn't eat such kind of things on the table. In fact, he didn't eat that much of this idea. The idea to pretend to realize he claimed he was… But definitely, , self-dulps me. But maybe, you wouldn't die. What's curious is that we never really talk about things. Not any great detail. Never to anyone outside of the books, especially in the books. So my brother's horse calls were bottled, the stored in the cellar of his sight only to harm the Newsears later that dreams. In fact, it's all now, I've never even asked you about another. But it's a third to a bus for it. On the day near the end of the school year, when I was a senior, who was in. That afternoon, I was engaged in heavy combat with my youngest brother, Rich, who was eight years old. Rich had uncanny and eye coordination. It was merciless video. I was a free universal master of asspartners. I had made a promise to myself that before graduating high school I would find a way to beat him. And by some cosmic truth never to be repeated, I was. I was creamy. I needed a bus could believe it. Which is when our next door neighbor, a woman just older than my mother first. 75 year old father had killed over on the lawn cardiac arrest. Our member my first thought was. But I'm about to kick your chest butt. And then I started outside telling her to get steep. Who's upstairs listening to music. Just right. I think I'll be able to be the song of this and to it. I think it's probably Bob Miley-Model buttons. I remember running outside to our neighbor's father, beginning CPR. I remember something happened, but I didn't expect it all. His ribs separating from the sternum, breaking slowly under the weight of my paw. I'm about to pull back this. I just remember, even if the feel of the guy's beer on his lips, when you have pretty normal reactions in the heart to the eye, I'm going to ask it for you again, this important that I want to pass away with the anger being pulled away from you, is seem to a record you have to go to a safe, something so life. That's, , do you do that on purpose? I definitely. remember having miserable actions. I remember hearing that in that sort of perfect early summer after new listening to perfect music and just coming down stairs and seeing what place knowing something and something happened bad sort of same feeling. Also a little tiny bit of resentment that just really influenced. And then seeing only ten situations as well towards your muscles. Having that feeling later. This was the thing about the first. It represented two totally discordant and opposite teenagers. On one hand, we still wanted to act  kids. But then at the same time, we want to be adults. We'd accepted the ultimate adult responsibility, writing his name or something how to countable, and lots. I would have been 17 years old at the time of my last series, it was spring of my senior year and all I wanted was to be happy with my growth. Just get lost, forget every last adult thing, blooming on the horizon. the specter of dog-awaited college and the net-of-act of a requirement of planning and worthy job, and means suing money-gree, and whatever it was, adults worried about them. But it was on duty, getting ready to go home, actually. When the clock came, the clock... out on Perthry, which juts out into Long Island sound. There are huge, beautiful trees out there, and the girl not much older than me run headlong in the one drop. It was a dark night when we arrived, we can find her, who are all out looking in the ditch by the road. And then suddenly I was at the car. What had been... and his whole front in his flat. I remember somehow opening the jam front door and seeing trapped women head down on the steering, her hair long and blonde, her body splattered with blood, and she was moaning a low sickly almost deflection. I remember taking her head in my hands to put traction, and lifting her back, and then almost swung up at what I saw. I don't know how to put this gentleman. which he didn't have a face. That is her nose had been driven into her head and there was a huge gash and forehead in which something brain-efficient. In her jaw hung half loose, in her eyes it will completely back, which is this white ghost that changed for quite enough. In EMT training, your topic, once you begin to portrait, can't let go. So I can't tell you how long I sat, based on Facebook this morning. Even after we put on a neck brace, they held her F. for hours. She moaned and moaned, and I too began to moan quietly to myself. Fire department was called and other ambulances with capability to administer drugs and the jaws of life were used to fire a loose line. But Dobile came too, as he often did to the bad ones. After several hours, after a huge crowd of gathered, we got around the other two other ambulances. Since I'd been with her at the beginning to stay with her until here. I remember standing up on the back fender, the back door is a stripper naked, a shot of full of drugs. And I remember a stream of her blood running down the floor of that ambulance of my white rebots. But Dobile was standing next to me for shaking his head. But you need some kind of stuff we've got for one set. Of a lot of things. This is heaven, th death so one said. By mortaged was death. See you next time. When I got home at night, my dad was up waiting. No, I wanted to tell him what had happened, I didn't. Or couldn't. I don't know why. Just stood for a while, making small talk, and then I wanted to bed. But here's the thing I remember, first about that. Somehow the girl's parents heard about the accident, made it to the crash set. And then they were moving for the back of the ambulance to see their daughter. The one they'd raised her. But there was a little boy there with a little boy. shoulder, knew exactly who they were and left down. I remember he wrapped his arms around both, talked to them in a local way, comforted. Covered them both up and led them straight away, three of them in a barrel. Here was the stranger in the clung to him, Jesus. I thought about that woman. parents last week when I myself was at the hospital the birth of my first child. Already I was imagining a life of this first words, this first steps, this first day of school, this first bike, this first girlfriend, this first active rebellion. I imagined what secret world tonight occupied one day and whether he would ever tell his father about. From our room at the hospital we have been to look down on the ambulances that came in one from the emergency room. In standing with my one day old son in my arms I watched. I watched the paramedics wheel and all sorts of people and returned with empty structures, joking with each other. And as to the window with my son in my arms I can land on the beach, watching others bob and a distant ocean diving up low reach. It was late afternoon, and the sun dropped down behind some low clouds, letting parking lots over. I watched as an email and striver ran to this rig. Put down the strobes, blurted, off to some new disaster, some broken body out there, some more. It was an old reflex, I admit, but I turned my son from the window and raised some out to my ear, just to make sure I feel it's breath. My patterned it, it's important to me. You're almost grown! I'm doing alright. I think that approach over the last day never been in this. I don't cross around the mud. I've got to make . Anyway I'm almost through. Back to, how's it been that 12? So what have you made the most important decision of your life when you were 12 years old and for all the wrong reasons? I meant on one was 12, back in there. 1980, living in Vietnam. This cousin was skimming up a way to escape the country by boat. It would be 36 people in the tiny crab. I'd try and hold a brother, it was invited on the trip, because he knew how to fix engines, which, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm trying to find a way to do it. Anyone to go, but for reasons I had very little to do with reality, and everything to do with kids' system. For me, we need to happen to change, not to me, to sort of 12. to travel in the internet times it's extremely difficult. So just have an opportunity to read the city, maybe go to North Vietnam through the time you're to escape or not, maybe a cool thing. And then, I thought, , escaping you because, not that easy. But really, you thought you would get caught, isn't that? You didn't actually think you're going to be with who you were. Right. Not exactly, in my mind, I didn't think you were being able to. So from here. It's sort of , , I love my name. I can't be separate. But this is not really true. This is good. Go and enjoy the visit and the cotton, send back to in my family. , so I learned my mom, has that holy dip from my days when the seed can be well, he's leaving. Either he make it, I've never seen him, make him a great, that future. If he get caught, then kill him or... know the chance of being death and the sea is great too. So she was really happy. And she didn't want to be dark, because I was really young and big. And then he has this sort of convinced and a my brother and my girlfriend was talking to me and she remembered in his world going on. They are directing young people in her. as soon as you reach the example to look and text. And then, possibly, I had stayed behind you whenever, enabled to get, , wouldn't be need to work to call it, to get a decent job. So after a lot of convincing, my name just decided, said, someone would get for you to check and text. But one thing to see when I'm writing the hotel room and see something you can have a bad of future and everything that you just never found. You're looking back to your back after I'm doing my own. And see  after that old sort of art because she did really speak to me very much until where god alone, y irgendwelely and we just give them some dedicated Aloha querer and κεcer does show up many things mantras. Now as a dog, I'll rest here. This one out of two people who are getting to it, who are women's or women's or women's or women's. Yeah, I mean the abs of being survived is really with small, either  I said, the boat is tip over and you get caught by the government, or you do being attacked by pirates, pirates. I mean, yeah, in the East, it's mostly in South Vietnamese, where you help. you scare. I don't know if I can say I was scared, I mean I was excited, , I don't think I really got scared and two I was on the boat, then theality said it something. So whatever we got on the boat. I got really sick. I just got really sick have never been on the boat going to the ocean. been on river boat and I remember praying to just about all the saints and  whom I know just going up to so that I could down a little the ass  to slap and die. It's just awful. One done and of course we did have something to do with it. We thought that we would take a six days to get from river to Hong Kong. This end up taking a lot longer. It's about both them. , so we encounter stormy, we're stranded in an island, in Tango. We have a little bit to go back for the island, but it's barely  maybe a few hand-pour price. We make big things soups, drink. But we manage to find  Auckland, we are seeing animals. We ate those, I tried to eat grass at one point, so hungry. And found out there. you can eat a lot of vegetation which is too big, so I don't know why, it's  a taste horrible, you can't even swallow it. And so you'd plan that a long take six days. I don't get a little energy change. Almost two months. It's two months goodbye. Where did you get up? Well we ended up in Hong Kong and of course  they know we were that. If they took us in to show the way. This will be better, you can share it with your life and that you can share it with. Proper check up man, which I do. Then they take us to another king. The first month as a new gap, some money, which just get the first month. To buy food. To buy food. Right. But then after the first month you have to work and they will try to help you find change. Outside. on the cross the jab that we get and they were talking really cheap to you. That for you you were 12. So this is the first time you've done that job. Well I didn't have to work. I didn't have to work. But my brother, because he had to take care of me. And since   I said we weren't really close into a wooden interact well you need. I just felt kind of lack of it. We know why. But on my phone,  I had, I was responsible, and that was to care of my brain, to make sure he got food, to get food to take to land, to get clothes to clean. And you're talking about  having two hair, jeans, or , two shirts. You have to do them daily. Wash your clothes, to coat both of my clothes. You have no refrigerator, and you're talking about living in a cancer chest. Again, you're fucked. That would be your room, true people. and you would hang  popped and you close everything, wouldn't that for me? And at first I was a little scared and I didn't know what that change. And here I have to go out, which I can say I want to keep, I want to keep it. Keep it rise in the hardest time. Did a lot of that viewpoint hand-sit and did you interview it? No, I mean, going up, I mean. sort of chase away from coming into the kitchen. My name is System. Go, go, go, go. So I never really learned. So when I got there, it was basically, I have to do it. Oh, what? We'll be hungry. We can't afford to purchase already, mate. So I would ask people, we can't watch them. Watch, wait a minute. We'll have to do it. Did you? Did you  being a human in the midst? shopping with it. And it's cool. Not really. Just at that point, , I wanted to do this half fun. For me, you have to be in the Hong Kong with you. It's kind of well-heated, , and you are seeing 60s or good, you're seeing a neon light, , the airplane, you're flying in the camera. Then you'll kill this one too. Well, just check it out. in causing the poor. Do you think it was good for you to have to be such a grunt? I have my thoughts asking you that question wrong. I am not sure how I would answer exactly I guess being forced to go up so fast on scientists. I do this is how I put it. to make the same choice. , probably not. Probably not. It's, but of course you can never. I don't know. I just feel that, but if I have to do it, I probably wouldn't do it. Why? I don't know. I just think, well, It's kind of a hard question,  because I'm happy to do it. I did work too. Disney does  I never get to see me. She has to say, I do. She's best to ask. After this is after the year I graduate. I see me. So I regret that I don't think you can have everything. Just back to what the mother said. You can't see me. or the well-being, life can offer you all this great performance and the sad, the chunk of out of love and the fun long, ladies and gentlemen, Katta Charity brought him to the United States after a year and a half and he's never been back to it. Coming up angering its uses, high school and its uses, and more, it's a minute propagating international when our program is in its own. Jayay, вже, parties will current drum system. Just American life on my request, if you're gonna program of course which is in the variety of different kinds of stories from this program. Stories of kids acting adults, some choice, some post. We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, Act 3, in this education, Josh Frank. This is another story at the young person making huge life changing decision, that is on pain, lost over a young. In this case, 13 years old. The only thing that's on that room with them. This is what it sounds  when I call home to talk to my parents. Whoever picks up has to go to another room so they can hear me. It's been  this for six years. This is my 17 year old brother, Mary for his future. I'm trying to practice now five hours a day. Four hours a day. Mom and dad ever have to, I'll be to practice from bit. They're  nuts. these days after it's coming to stop, right to say,  it might get to be  11 or 12. They won't get to bed and they think the neighbors be mad so they have to tell me to stop. Josh is training to be a professional trumpeter. He calls the incestive practising his insurance to guarantee you and help the skills he needs in the future. During the week he goes to a regular public high school. But on Saturdays he devotes 15 hours of it. day to truly arts pre- college program. Basically, it's  cramming everything you get in one week at a conservatory into one day. Josh is pretty obsessive about his form. He brings it to school every day just in case of classes cancelled. When our family went on vacation, Josh was sure to have his trumpet. Then he got to a point where he told our parents he'd rather not go on vacation a week off could be better spent practice. Five years ago, Josh gave up. being kicked through the trumpet. I can remember telling my friends what I was going to be doing and it was at the beach and we were all at Blit and it was this thing I did in his grave. You were gliding around Park Ma and I was  guys guess but I got it this free college program. Some that didn't match the way. Okay, well, I guess you would really be around on Saturdays and I was , and guess not, yeah, and it was a little different  the music is more important and even even if it doesn't go on for Saturdays, you can't realize you could have it both ways. In the first few years of high school, Josh used to call his friends to see what he was missing. They would tell him, oh, we just hung out until three in the morning, driving around or sitting at the diner. Not very excited. So Josh figured he wasn't missing much. When they invited him, he couldn't go. After a while, they stopped fighting. It wasn't until junior year that we just never saw him. anything of each other. This is Eric, one of Josh's old friends. They used to play in orchestra together at school. And then this year, I meant to call that games and to summon. I just didn't regard around to it. And then, , I think we might have talked once or twice. Oh yeah, we played Frisbee at the beach a couple times. But then, school star Julia started. And, , Josh gets a little confused. It's a relationship sort of riddled with formalities in their spirit, little substance left. I got together with Eric and two other kids, Josh has known since elementary school, Katie and Dave. I wanted to know if Dave thought he was missing out. But  Eric, Katie and David said it was hard for them to talk about Josh. They told me they don't know him very well. want. They all agree. It's hard to put a label on what he's missed. All it is is a few hours of chilling time each week. We're nothing really happens. But it all adds up. Oh yeah, I'd say he's missing out on that. Obviously, because he's not there. But if you asked, he asked us what we did  it to what we can. It wouldn't be a lot of great by changing things. I think I'm a whole, , over  a long period of time, he imposes out on. getting closer with friends. Good. , , as our curfew was sort of extended, moving stay out in 12th,  say, on Friday night's seat half to say, , at 10 or something, and he'd say, okay, I'm going to show you our tomorrow's seat. You guys there. So that's two hours for us to fill without Josh, , and eventually that it's up to a lot of hours to kill without Josh. Eventually, that sort of, wasted. I think it leads to Josh doing alienated from his friends. When Josh was in eighth grade and told me what he wanted to do, I worried about him about what he was giving up. I thought he should have a normal high school experience, even though  a lot of people, I hated high school. I hated it so much I left a year early. Let some help, the medical high school is so powerful, that even those of us who just... despised it, think that you're missing something important if you don't go. Josh goes to the same high school I did, and the time I think it's most painful for him is that much. It does suck. basically at every lunch period, lunch is  the big social time during school. And, , I don't  classes. I don't  my. class I don't  going to that stuff but the thing is most dread is lunch because I have to figure out what I'm going to do for that half an hour in the past when I have sat at lunch with with people it's it's really awkward for me because they're talking about what they are doing what they're going to do and I never feel included which kind of separates me and it's a touch, it's really peaceful. So the way I deal with it is just to get into music. , maybe it will practice in English instead of eating or eating or eating at home. Today, all of Josh's close relationships are with other musicians. They connect easily without having to explain new motivations for working so hard. And they have their own social scene, although it's not typical of kids their age. My friends often throw parties at his apartment, called SIGREDING PARTYES, which is very strange at the beginning. and you're just reading it together. And it's just reading music. And then when you're not reading, you're just taking out. And it's a good time for us in this music. You're describing this as your favorite social experience. And it's doing exactly what you would be doing if you were working. And you're right, you'll jump. Totally. Back when he was little, Josh took violin and piano, and our mom used to set the timer in the kitchen to make sure he practiced for half an hour. He quit those instruments. It was just torture getting him to sit for that long. But with the trumpet, it's almost as if he can't help himself. I can't explain it. It was right. That it was just meant to happen. I'm gonna press you on this little bit more. Why? What was so different about it? But it had to be  some difference. Was it because you were using your mouth for? I think it was the sound. , just the sound that the trumpet made was, I was thought was really beautiful. And sounds really warm and you can really soon on it. You can be this. or you can be just  in the orchestra and be the biggest pig in when you're playing Wagner just play really loud and really brilliantly just to be a part of something  that is really special. It's amazing to adults when a 13-year-old announces he or she has made a major life decision, and then sticks with it. One of the most adult things you can do is make a choice. Give up something fun and favor of something else. Though Josh says he won't really feel  an adult until he's doing his own laundry, getting his own groceries, ironing his own dress shirt before performances, living on his own. I'm not just, it's finally good at bed, let's listen up. It's late. Your favorite Frank is an art student in the arts. F You can't conceive of pleasure in my smile. You hold my hand. Look for my hand. It's lots of fun to have you be. At court, angry young man, times two. This is the story of two people. One is late teens, one is late 15s. And we'll start with the older man. We'll be lost to up an artisan on the 1940s. Big cut. I'm busy. There's a big stunt here. And we're going to the field. I was wondering how to do with my mother-in-law five six seven years old. And I had fast hands. I noticed, and because watching her, you had to get a cut and real fast because how great a cut in particular she was. And then I got 12. I was only here. I was kicking too hard and 50 pounds and 12 years old. When mother-in-law was 13, stepfather died. just months later, there's another guy too, Spinal Men in China. And after the funeral, when he was headed back to the family's house, I was in the house. When I caught the bus, he went back to hell, and when I got to my address, which was 11, 36 p.k. and I looked there and then the house was empty. There was no furniture, there was nothing. One of his sisters, who was pregnant, in the 12th grade, had taken off the house. And after the funeral, they had moved away, and no one took me in. I mean. I didn't know anything and they had their own life and I guess they just told me about steel me, some of my family said that they were going to get a job, I was big some of my age but I did not want that. Here's how we made London song, it's a freshman song. Sister's boyfriend, happy birthday to her, and another sister is says, in the 24 hours month. My book iswelke kapuddhisattva, you're going to buddh it, you're on! to some cars, it is own means. People from Churchill, Gaporn, Boy Scouts was a big part of the sign of office school, the Cate Sports, he turned to God. And he supported himself with a series of jobs that relied on Brawkis to a train, to a nice truck, in the beer truck, in the soda truck, carrying heavy Cate's bottles, heavy box, that driving 11 and he had a bomb reaching, but I was powerful and I was quick. So what I did, I found that people would notice me and give me help, so, besides. be good in sports. Being people love, I mean I thought it was crazy. I said here I am nobody know me as a person but they love me as a violent animal and I thought it was crazy but  unfortunately that's why I got my love because everybody attention came to me in sports and I had a lot of hurt in my heart because you're mother died you are 80 and you want to wow other people get married. And so boxing I just enjoy being a mat. See you're pretty angry as a teenager. Wonder that term. I don't think it term. I'm just do you fight. , every day I think about it. People had put on high school and was just as violent to put up by her as it was a boxer he says. He went to college and put up scholarship, played pro ball, and buffalo bills, winning two championships in the team led by Jack Cam. After that he became a cop and finally ended up in the assisted superintendent, the Audi bomb, juvenile detention center in Chicago. Which is, as far as anybody seems to know, the largest juvenile lock-up in the world, sometimes as many as 600 kids earn bars. Many of them full of anchor. M. full of anger for justifiable reasons, understandable reasons. Mr. Ross, back when he was there, really, we were angry and I really heard because there was a kind of understanding why none of my people took me in, , and I had, I was good to it. And I see these kids, it's happening to them. These kids who locked up here, a juvenile, a tension shift. It happened to them, and I stressed them, it happened to me. But I have, of them this, said them. kid in the education. One of the many kids Mr. Ross told his stories to his parents golden. Parents described his own life this way. Until he was 90s as he did well in school, things were fine. And then it all fell apart. He was fathered at the cancer. And there's  what a problem is being gained, , it's the heart is being humid less than what happened in your life. Start the change, . For about things the wrong way, don't express myself holding anger. There's a deal of it. when it's ready to go, it's  a volcanic blow. We will cause you. I was personally my family. I opened it. Of course we hear them on what we eat, that I'm a much of being close but I really want to go close one month far and see China say me all the same, so me all the right things So the more the way I thought was wrong Parents started doing bad Wayne's school, didn't listen to anybody, cut no Also to travel finally was arrested to the age of 14, the murder, a gang shoot here at the God. Once he was behind bars, he started to think about things, calm down, and seemed to change. He befriended some adults, wrote and acted in some plays with a theatre group, by some a chain of other teenagers, contemplated consequences and crimes. He stand at the army home for two years, in this case worked at Twethy's court. Finally, he wrote a kingdom, he was found guilty of murder. He made enough of an impression on the adults. in Morocco with several rarely testifying and have many kids chose to test out parents at a sentencing of him to convince the judge to do his work taking a chance on. One of these adults was Mede Palados, the other group music theater workshop, could spend months working closely with parents. For 10 years, out of hundreds of kids she's worked with in-bodies, she's only testified for a five. Says parents was a natural leader, work part at a sentencing room, got along with everyone. And when one shows mom's hand screaming, that no one doesn't understand..... And, , my criteria at basically was whether I'm in the kid and something's awful, whether the woman wants to be with a female background and tell me, I mean, what basically question I asked myself was what I invited to have the statement house. , what I bring them into my house, what I often have, what I help them out in the answers, yes, then I'll go to court. Because there are some things that I really , who I wouldn't. Because I think, , although I  them very much, if they went out in the street, they didn't write me into. By the chance, and there was a lot of us in the ability to... Parents also asked, really lost its crimes at home. We just lost it in the damn. The Liberals tend to think about cases  this one one, but servitive things about the movement. Really lost its thinking takes in both sides. But give you the Libero law, to tell you that the only difference between him and parents is its sports programs, church programs, another positive community activity, so they're from this world. And that's what's safe, that's what parents have had. And it'll give you the conservative law. The any 14. in your old 12-year-old who shoots somebody, knows exactly what it's going to do. Which, who's lost to me, is to be the death of him. And this kid and everybody must have lost and he asked me to go to court. I would not do that. I did not go to court. But, too. So, something, , , but not about him, Kran. I found him, he found me today. Say, very come. One of the thing that Cholo cares, I believe in death. Even good 12, 13, 14 year old care, you should send that. Yes, I believe in, because I was 12, with no more in 13, and I knew better. And I had a rifle at 9 years old, and yet still I had more. judgment didn't pull a trigger and would all the anger on head. For years now, states have been cracking down on children's mind, sets in teenagers and even pre-teens as they can see in their senses. It looks  young people have been facing adversity now to master their emotions and have become a common. Parents were tried as an adult and set this as an adult in 40 years. When you're a girl this week, the age of 17, entered. maximum security prison, Joey out of long. It's not  the audio, the counselor is clasped into these. At acknowledgement these kids might be really pitiful. There's a lot of different. The officers, they different. They more aggressive, more aggressive. Lowering me out the hip, my kids feel as I've heard. I need to be me out of the field. In my sleep. See there is more laid back. See here. We have to watch. Watch the things it was around. Do you take care of it? Yeah. Do you take care of it? It's solving the mass, man. I can make myself this way. I don't solve them if I really stay in my service. It's just  this. It's not going to church. in prison says it's hard to stay on the street now. He doesn't get into trouble. Those are 20 years.
