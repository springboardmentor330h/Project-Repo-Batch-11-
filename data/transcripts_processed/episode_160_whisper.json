  "text": "What's it mean to do politics in this country these days? Consider the straight man named Jack Robinson. One day this march, though, to press conference communes, there's going to start gathering signatures, get on the ballot, to run for Senate, Massachusetts against Teddy Kennedy. He never runs a political office report. Literally, , within 24 hours of, at least putting our need forward, they were, they were, they were, they were within attack, literally within first day of announcement in May. I was at the Republican State Committee headquarters having interviews press sitting down with one of the reporters reporter asks me after I said no I'm running. By the way, have you ever been arrested? You're not driving. And I said yes. No, no, no about that. You see what the case is for. Since I've found not guilty, I've found my passing weapons. So it's very forthright, it gave me details, but that was the beginning of them. I just did stop. Have you ever had a respinning one of them? this, that, from blocks. Plam was to announce the campaign perhaps the political night of the time I'd find that we'd be getting a week or so. I don't know if it was a little bit I know that was in a day of announcing the campaign, no one would care about it. That's who I am, what I stand for, but what's in my past? And so check Robinson to set it to take action. He is a long, public statement that is simply one of the most remarkable documents of current political rights in this country. We called it the Robinson Report, supposed to draw on the internet for anybody to read. Throughout lines, the matter of fact grows and a disturbing level of detail. Everything, we think he's ever done long. An unpaid speeding ticket from the 1980s, and then we go Marshall Arts and Pement that we saw. Officer Foundon is pocket and graduate student, the failure to pass the bar exam for you times. A plagiarism case against them. A restraining word, and one would put against them. Foriety of business law science. By making this information public, early in the campaign, wrote, I hope to have offered my fellow citizens a full and fair description of my personal background in a manner which allows them to decide whether I am capable of representing them in a position of public trust, confidence, and honor. David. I know that the press person worked a little bit with his feet, drop the dot on himself. But I think the citizen will have to decide, you see, the future is the only thing that doesn't have to be wrong, I'm literally not blind, I don't know, grab. The end of the day, people don't care about my contribution, the US, the only one who can't have a chat with Puerto Rico. Check out my new message in chapter 2, and what he caught Ted Kennedy's boyballs, four times. in the hour of the step-up. Each time, crying, they should not be part of any campaign. Sort of nasty. But what exactly is man's new? This is the state politics in America. And as we head into another season of presidential campaigning, Al Gore is already pounding on George Bush, and George Bush made current the primaries that went threatened, he'll get his nasty asses he has. Next few months of our political lives, we're going to be a green, just a go. So, preparation for the mud, we asked today what a week think of all this, what a week to make of what our culture is. For the B.B.E. Z. Chicago Public Radio International, to some American life, America asks, our program today, to shed light on the current situation, true stories of character assassination, political, and non-political. исторiale. Act 1, those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it, those who pay attention to history, are also condemned to repeat it. Act 2, Sunny takes a ball, which David Foster Wallace reports on a turning point in the primary campaign of John McCain. John McCain's last moment is the serious contender. The moment when his opponent started attacking, he had to decide how to handle it, and how he decided, while. Act 3, when fine is good. form a political consultant explains why it is that he tried to bait his opponent into attacking sometimes. At four, you're going to call the conversation with one of the people that you're higher if you're attacked. At five, when attacks really count, the lucky character assassination when it occurs to make far more devastating arena than politics, talking about junior high school. Stay with us. At one, those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it, as much historians about dirty political attacks, and they will tell you that they go back to the very beginning of our nation. Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, funded an opposition newspaper, trashed President George Washington, while Jefferson was actually part of Washington's administration. This is the next joint for years. Politicians root team. English, used each other, being landers, having children, being atheists. The only things that are different now says a story in Richard Gorton's mouth. But at the first, the man of his remember hand, because none of us knows anything about history. And second, because of television and the other electronic music, we see every action, flash of these guy's faces. Which gives it all a certain emotional power. I mean, it's all in closer. It's much more intimate, power to me. is much more intimate. I mean, a hundred years ago, or even the early part of the 20th century, presidents were a century remote figures. We saw them in newspapers. We didn't see them 24 hours a day. They didn't come into our living. So they weren't, in effect, an extended member of the family, a member of the extended family. There is an intimacy about modern persons. In fact, that intimacy extends to all politics at every level. For example, what? It could be more intimate than this phone call, which made statewide news messages, even the car guys played it on their program on NPR. Sanitory of Candidate Jack Robbins was in a cell phone, talking to recorded Tony Randall, a public radio station WBU owner. She was a quick interview asking about that day's news,  Governor Paul Salucci, Dr. Support for Lums. Lastly, we can have as a Republican governor, after Candidate and I say Senate campaign to Senator Kennedy, just because the governor does not. I think that they're cutty. I just got my hat. I'm sorry, Philip. I'm still here, are you up? You got into an accident? Well, somebody do 50, but I'm okay. I've worked with the other guy to get across the highway here. But anyway, for everything coming, the position is drawing is important. Now people are plotting across the highway, but I'm okay. Looks  the other guy is still. Yes, I am fine. Okay, I kind of don't know what I mean, new territory. I think we'll have to stop the interview, but you got what you need. Sorry about that. With the car accident, stream of taxpayers, share oddness, putting out gloves in the court, detailing some past, at some point a kind of high-alignment tone, keep them dressed and jerk Robinson. And at this point. The press and other politicians don't seem to take him very seriously. But another WBU award reporter, Sean Colt, spent a day watching Ravans meet Republican firms. They also relieve that anybody who runs against him. They embraced him. So I started to say if we're doing all this, Adam's help has helped her hurt? Do you feel  it's fair that a person she can't just say this much about themselves to get an opportunity? I don't know. It's difficult for me to write it to that honest, which is what she will be honest. But it's fair enough, it's not fleeting term. People will ask, if this is weaponry. What do you think, person? I don't know, I mean, I've done it. But person, you do feel that it's fair. It's a bright action. I have to just know that it's true, bro. No, it's definitely not right. But we're right now, it's bad to me. It's not how we should be picking cannons. Who's got the strongest hide? Well, is everything in a person's back on it? Plus these guns? There's a snowshoon here sometimes that the viciousness of moderate politics keeps good people from running for office. Sometimes the politics of attack simply casings the political demise of candidates, prospects, or in so great from the start. Meeting Jack Robinson, you wonder about his seriousness. In his last official filing Federal Election Commission, his campaign war chested at $613 As compared with his compliment. 3.7 million. He has yet to articulate any policy positions because he seems truly impatient about. And when I visited his campaign headquarters, there were no signs in the windows, no campaign posters out of front. Nothing that would let anybody know. But anybody was running for anything. 2.2 person. It turns out that if both sides and political fights start throwing modern each other, contrary to you what you might think, you can definitely benefit one side more than the other. In a sense, this is the scenario that decided this year's Republican nomination, President. David Foster Wallace happened to be recording in South Carolina, Primaries, the campaign of John McCain when he got a chance to see this happen . Even the net one texts will attractively send masters in creating a rather clean time, a bored after their minds didn't. But with a text handle the board and is becoming extremely slush and twacking so that lined up on a makeshift bottom in the look  an exhibit of wizards whose rockets and highmen. Nobody leaves. All sorts of media about 40. The ABC Cameron and Let's As Eyes almost closed and maps in an unrestful way. The CBS and CNN texts look  cards. Today are not even bothering to play cards. R occupied by rectangle Hardens that in an impasse. Outside the riverfront hotel side door was so cold and windy you have to smoke with mitten's on. June C and his partner Frank C, in a relationship, engaged in some off the record discourse about the 12 monkeys. This is the text-private card name for the most elite in these the popular pencils in the UK and press call. The 12 monkeys are a dozen. and market journalists and political analysis guys from a really important papers and news services. It intended me so totally identical and dressed into meaners to be almost literally so real. 12. Maca-Lidden Rural Free Navy Mead Wazers, Half Winsor Tyrants, heated chinos, Oxford Closher, city-to-mine jackets come off, stay 100% buttoned in the collar and sleeves, full-hime offers, you can totally show specs they love to take off in the new but be normal. Plus, all is a uniform self-series, that reminds you of every over-achieving degree you ever wanted to keep the ass on the school. The techs avoid and try to pretty much ignore the 12 monkeys. We'll intern, treat the techs the way someone in an executive bathroom treats the attendant. I'm returning to the smug break, we pass through a huge infant-laden- space. It takes a long time. and converts this area. A hundred yards, nothing reflects stone walls and blocks the sad potentials names of the riverfront hotels, bank, or halls and conference rooms, the Oak Room, the Windsor Room. But now out here are also half a dozen different members of the camping press. Each fifty feet away from the meeting others, for privacy, and all walking in idle little counterclockwise circles with a cell phone to do. These little orbits are the cellular walls, which is properly the digital equivalent. of doodling or picking it yourself as you talk in a regular room line. There's something oddly lovely about the Walts' different circles here, which are a various diameter since bright links and rates of rotation draw identically capital clockwise and telephonic. We threw slow down a bit to watch, and couldn't not. From above,  if there were a mezzanine, the Walts' would look  the cards and some strange diffuse machine. Frank C says you can tell about her face is something. up. Jim C says what's interesting is that media is south of the equator, media is exact same cellular walls, or the down there on our circles of the verse. And it turns out Frank C was right as usual that for reason press or dashing out and waltz and urgently learn a lot of things that were superb to start a discred, and this is for Mike Murphy from the K-2000 High. come in, it's coming down to do a surprise and prompting press of him regarding a fresh two-page press release, still slightly warm from the Xerox, which two press liaison are passing out even now, and of which the first page has in bold caps, Bush campaign caught red handed with negative ads. Unethical, push-pulling. This document is unusual not only because McEang 2000's press releases for normally studies and bland relevance, McEang to continue. campaigning in Michigan today. McCain has two helping some of the salids out there, a line of DFW picklead. But also because no less a person who took the Mr. Mike Murphy's indeed now just from down to spin this abrupt change of tone and cute beans' rhetoric. Murphy, who is only 37, but seems older, is the McCain campaign's senior strategist. A professional political consultant who's already had 18 winning Senate in Kentucky minority in Texas. He's a short bottom-friend man. in a kind of Eastyway, with baby fine red hair on a large head, and sleepy turnulazin hunt the same sort intentionally nerdy one room's the lot of musicians and college kids now when. A unpolitical prose, Murphy has the reputation of being one, smart and funniest hell, and two , Arila Takdog, working for clients  Oliver Norne, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman, and Michigan's own John Newworth in campaigns that perhaps loot operas in nasties. These lean back through the silent feed rooms wall and surrounded the 180 degree arc for the 12 monkeys. All of whom have stent on notebooks for tiny professional tape employers out and keep clearing their froats and pushing their glasses up with excitement. Murphy says he's quote, just one by to provide the press corps with some context on the striding press release. And to give the corps advance notice that the McEonQ pain is also prepared for special response and with. start airing until you're aligned with the mark. Murphy uses the words response or response add nine times in two minutes and when one of the monkeys iterates to ask whether it be fair to characterize this new add as negative, Murphy gives him a long, stiptic look and spells out heard slowly. R, E, S, P, O, N, S, E. He says that the press release and new ad reflect the McCain 2000 campaigns decision after much agonizing. To respond to what he says is GW Bush's Welch and undertook here that's public hand shaped greener than January to run a bilateral repositive campaign. For the past five days, mostly in New York and South Carolina, the shrub is apparently then running ads that characterize McCain's policy proposals and what Murphy. in terms of a willfully distorting way. Plus, there's the push-pulling, a practice which is regarded as the absolute bottom-feet of seasy-convenient actions. But the worst, the most obviously unacceptable, refeared, the sizes, was the shrub standing up at a podium in South Carolina a couple days ago with a wild-eyed and apparently notorious free-inch veteran who publicly accused McCain of quote, abandoning his fellow veterans after died. Which? Murphy says, even without going into the caves, well documented personal by-out, as the Royal College of Slated Efforts on behalf of Vets for nearly 20 years, is just so clearly over the line of even minimal personal decency in the manner that it pretty much necessitates some sort of despondent. The 12 monkeys who are old pros at this sort of exchange, keep trying to steer Murphy away from what the shrubs done, and get into the cave, horrible. The exploration of why the King himself decided to run this response ad. The transcript of which the carried press is on so now distributing from a fresh copier box in which reads, in part. I guess it was bound to happen. Governor Bush's campaign is getting desperate with a negative ad about me. His ad twists the truth  Clinton, where all pretty tired of that. The 12 monkeys now point out that, in particular, the twist through flight soon. in the season. It seems negative indeed. Since in the year 2000, comparing the GOP candidate to Bill Clinton, his roughly equivalent to flaming that he wears ladies underwear, while presiding over South Korea's masses. While checking the pro-licks of footmaid and getting ready to avoid the crest-boss from a game's next stop, the GOP lead can day dinner in Saginaw. In network tax, listen to this reporter's summary of a press release in Murphy's Cup. comments and confirm that the shrub has indeed gone negative. He advised that these network cameras and sound guys who all have worked in countless campaigns and who have neither the raging egos of journalists who are the self-interested agenda of the McCain 2000 staff to muddy their perspective. Turn out to be way more acute and sensible political analysts than anyone will be for C&TV and their assessment of today's negativity developments is so extraordinarily nuanced and sophisticated that only a smile. portion of it can be ripped off and summarized here. And the text now killed the last of the time we were referring by coolly analyzing bushes and negativity and we came to response from a technical point of view. Going negative is risky. Countless polls have shown voters find negativity distasteful and extreme, and if a candidate is perceived to go negative, it usually costs you. But of course, GWB. The Bush is a creature of his cute bean advisers, and these advisers are the best that 70 million dollars from full faith and credit the GRP established with combined. During the Bush 2015, the Skon negative must be solid political logic behind the move. Under the text lands, this logic turns out for the indeed solid, even brilliant. The shrubs attack leaves became with two lotters. If you choose is not to retaliate, some South Carolina voters will credit to the new. I learned, but it could also come off as windy, and my compromise McKinney's images and tough, tick-knows sh** guy with balls to take on the Washington Club Park Resid. Some McKinney pretty much has to strike back, attacks agree. But this is extremely dangerous, for by retaliating negatively, McKinney runs the risk of looking  just another ambitious, winning any cost-power efficient. And after all so much time and effort and money, the starting of the testing room is the office in the back. Plus, the CBS Cameron points out that an even bigger reason why Mckin hit a fort to let the shrub, float, pull him down to his level. Is that if Bush then turns around and retaliates against the retaliation, and so then Mckin has to re-with-halliated his Bush's retaliation, and so on, in the whole GOP race quickly degenerate and adjust the sort of boring, depressing, cynical charge and countercharging contest that turns for his often keeps them away from the polls. The important technical point here is that John S. McEat from not before you have voters that turned off. Since after all, his whole strategy is based on exciting people and inspiring them and pulling more voters in. Especially people who stop voting because they've gotten so disgusted and bored with all the negative and bullshitting of politics. In other words, this reporter proposes to the text. Maybe actually the shrubs on what himself interests to let the deer. be primary race get ugly and negative and have voters get so bored and cynical and disgusted with the whole thing that they didn't even bother to vote. Well, no f*** surelock H, the ABC tax and essence respond. Good old Frank C, then explaining more patiently than, yes, if there's a low voter turnout, then the majority of the people who get off their ass and do vote will be the diehard Republicans, meeting the Christian rights in the party faithful, and these are the groups that protest their toll. one's controlled by the GOP establishment and establishments that's at $70 million and 100% of its own credibility invested in the shrub. CNN's Mark A. POSIS that this also explains why the amazingly lifeline Al Gore, over the Democratic race, has been suddenly lentlessly negative in the press and is attacks on Bill Bradley. store  the shrub as his party's establishment behind him with all its authorization and money and the die hearts and fallen to line and voters they're told. It's in big Al's interest to draw as few voters as possible in the democratic primers because the lower the overall turnout, the more the establishment voters balance action count. Which fact that in turn the CBS camera in the sense helps explain what Even though our elected representatives were always reading their hands and making concerned noises about loud-bought or turnout, nothing substantive ever gets done to make politics less ugly when depressing and to actually induce more people to vote. Our elected representatives are incumbents and low-turnouts favorite incumbents for the same reason soft money does. This time the texts are on the press bus. It sits only a 10-minute ride at the Saginaw Geopi dinner. They have their cables down and boom sticks retracted, but all their gears still strapped on, which forces them to sit up uncomfortable straight and wind succumbs. And in the bus's mirrored ceiling, we could even more of a sci-fi combat groups in their way to some alien beach end. In their opinion, tomorrow's response at is not promising start from the cave, especially the twist that clicks in line. 12-month-old is jumped on my phone. This lines to me, it does not sound high-run, it sounds pissed off, aggressive, and it will allow Bush to do a react, and now say that its McKean is violated the huge infected agreement, which the tech-say will of course be bullshit, and that it might be effective bullshit, and that its McKean is aggressive at that, that's giving me a shrub, they open me to do it. The tech-space-ocannoluses commotivation behind the ads, twist the truth by Clinton line. Is that McKean? the King is genuinely, personally pissed off of the shrug, and today is taken  Murphy's leash off and what Murphy do, but Murphy does best, which is gutter fun. The King, after all, is known for having the temper. In Jimsey thinks that needed to cool in Jimsey's then-the shrug strategy did, was to find a way to genuinely witness the King off and make him want it their own negative, even though his staff had to have warned him that this was playing right into Bush's strategy Jimsey and Alice suddenly reminds this report, heard. and think of the godfomb, where some aquariums pay off laws is temporary, which bars union to tell you exploit by committing carlard beat up Connie and makes Sunny so in the same way and when you drive soft to kill Carla, you get to assassinate and bars union with her that told me from the rich man parkway. And her taciturn that's sinister  CNN, human and speculates that the bush camp he's brain-crossed and they actually can base their whole negative strategy and bars union is ingenious calling godfomb. We're upon Frank's seat. that Bush's equivalent to slapping Kami-Kali on around, standing up with a whack on that, who claimed that the king distanced his Vietnam comrades, which at first might have looked stupid and unnecessarily nasty of Bush, but from another perspective might be sure genius, that made McCain so angry that his desire to retaliate and not leave his own vehicle judgment. Because Frank C. warns, just watch, this retaliation and Bush's response to it, when McCain's response to Bush's response, this will be all that's done. monkeys in the rest of the press corps are interested in. And if McKay less things get too ugly, he won't be able to get anybody to pay attention to anything else. Make sure enough, events for next week, they has bare-out the text analysis pretty much 100%. On Tuesday morning, on the Radisans TV and North Savannah South Carolina, close today and good morning and I'll lead with the geoh peak. campaign takes an ugly turn and showed a part of McKay's new ad where he says, twist the truth Clinton. And sure enough by midday the shrub is put out a react where the accused is John S. McKay and violating the heard check agreement and going negative and adds the key, the shrub is personally offended and outraged at being compared to WJ Clinton. And by Wednesday night, focus polls are showing that South Carolina voters and finding the key to add negative into Prussian. In the next couple. As the day as polls then have both McCain's support and primaries projected voter turnout following  a rock. The daily presser having to turn out peace after peace of that all the endless picking and charges and countercharges. Everyone on the bus is starting to get severely discurated and bored. Even the 12-month-old striads have lost a certain smudged spring. Isn't it  a South Carolina, and then a couple weeks later the whole carlough and sunny scenario plays out again on Super Tuesday. Only bigger this time, with the King Lashin angrily out the Christian right, and calling Robertson and Falwell, Agent 7 Tolerance, and basically alienating the whole GOP's diehard right way. And why? Because some person or persons unknown had gotten Falwell and Robertson to take certain anti-MK remarks and disseminate them by all amounts phone call to registered voters in key states. Remarked so off the charts mean and distorted but by pissing King off enough he goes on TV and gives the Christian right the public feeder. While Murphy and King 2000 pack him the end out the stand and invite the risks and frustration. Practically seeing the King's glossy poop, pulling while he after that told him.

And then, in 1980, he worked at some times when you're a poon, it has can actually help you. And time he was working on John E. Anderson's camp president Anderson, just being attacked by candidate Ronald Reagan and by candidate Jimmy Carter the Democrats would say Dr. Hote He's flaky He threw bitch. I mean they just went after and on the Republican side that  Anderson is a liberal Trump's wife that's big thing they came out and the more they attacked What did it do to answer to him? Well, that was the interesting part. But more the attack, the better it was for us. His whole ratings rose steadily to the summit. I mean, steadily and swift. He on the scene to feel their focus and intensity are in my virtue of their attack. See, we do care about the R-R-R-R-Tact just then. That was it, Bob. Other interesting, because there's a third part of Candidate. His big problem was to keep him on it. Seriously, it's a thread. Here he's got the two other Candids, letting people know he is a thread. Exactly, by virtue of their focus on it. Do they attack anything else in terms of people's feeling that it can't be? Yeah, they do. They provide opportunities where the Candidate... It must be real and genuine. Our hands show their own ourselves. They break through the noise. Can't stop. When the attacks come, people sort of snap to attention. Because they think that, , whether the attack is credible, but I'll see now as I'll see, can't did it, X, actually respond, , real person  I, and it, Want me to do it, faz the house? for that sort of window that moment, for the voter to actually see the face of something real. Ron Suss-Tine, Washington City. Tech 4. Are you going to call? Character assassination unit runs all through our society. And there is an entire class of consult who does nothing but help people and companies that are under public debt. It doesn't have one of these people. He works for a crisis management firm, Washington. What is very important for people to understand is the character assassination has become big business. There are a series of folks who package tax and they include plaintiff's lawyers, activist groups, individuals with random acts to grind and who are willing to get on to you and say something bad about your product. person and the media are very very likely to embrace these attacks. There is a huge infrastructure and distribution channel by which to sell it. For example, when Kathy Lee Gifford was attacked by the magazine below where her husband was set up in a hotel room with a steward. That would be  a collar, the steward is sustained by a steward is who was paid. The very same people who claimed that they were disgusted by this attack. to draw up with low sales by 15% that year. Seems interesting to me, one of these things are using one reason why these circumstances have products, one to 70%. We write that feeling, feeling, and what. And there's something else that we'll be wanting to sell in the product here. Yeah, the attack on Kathy was given was of course engineered by finding a vulnerability with a husband, but there's no question. get this Kathy to get people were out to get her along on the client and my feeling is when you get on television day and you talk about your perfect marriage and your perfect job. You have a lot of people out there who are saying, , I don't know the perfect marriage, I don't know the perfect job. Nothing's over and the public was extremely receptive to any negative information they got from about. Here's that with strategy used by your Kathy. the fact that they let people know that they were hurt, that this hurt their marriage, this cause, that I mean, how important is that? I think the first thing that the gift for today is I recall it was a correct which is to deny what this happened. Ultimately, the old they found out a little uncomfortable the fact which is there was film. The glove stage did very kind of the first they released and got... denials and they came out with the video in the weekday. Well that's exactly right. Initially they denied it and when there's hardcore evidence, no pun intended, it's a very, very hard thing to back out from. But the next thing to get for this did was absolutely correct. They acknowledge what the most fundamental thing the public wanted to hear was, which is that they are human and that they are hurt. One way to get people off your back is to see that you're human. And that is really what a lot of times the goal of these tax art bring you down to our size. I think that the media understand that there are certain basic things in the nature where the narratives have to be repeated. And the public in joy, see, someone who they believe has too much fall. What is its strategy about it is when the attack comes. They are cast as cast as. characters in this drama. And at that point, it's almost is that they have to choose what role they want to play. And they have to give people the satisfaction who will get from the drama. That is, people want to see that take a ball. They have to be contrite. They're compliant. They won't be playing the character that will actually end the story. Every news attack is packaged  a traditional Hollywood entertainment. There is a villain. There is a victim. There is a vindictator. You can either. be the villain of the victim of the vindicator. In this particular case, the Giffords were the villains. They were people who lied to us about the quality of their marriage. The victims, of course, were us, the American public who were duked by these horrible people. In the vindicator, of course, was the globe who came forward to bring this truth as hideous truth to us. The Giffords have a choice at that moment. They can either stay the villains or they can become the victims and neither is a wonderful choice by the way. And the best choice for it. them at that point was to come forward and show their humanity by playing the role of a victim. The thing about a attack is that it must end with a clear and unequivocal conclusion or the public's frustrated. We want total guilt, we want total innocence, the conclusions have to be unequivocal. What would you advise somebody  to govern the attack on is a record and any that whatever happened in our own possible device presence. that the government pushes is in ready for office that is tax plan in the foreign policy. Risky, that Texas, the Federal Taxis, is terrible, is Texas and substand, health and education policies. Respiracy in the cross-text is the most polluted in the country. What should George Bush do against that? What are his options? In order for an attack to work, doesn't have to be true, has to be plausible in the resume. The first thing he has to do is find out which... these attacks resonate. I think to the biggest attack on Bush that does resonate is this broad notion, not of this policy or that policy, but that he is not a guy who has the seasoning to handle this job. And the best thing he can do is demonstrate that he does. And one of the ways to do that unfortunately is to is to go on the attack back against Gour. Now if your follow-up question is are you saying that he should defend by ineffective? attacking, unfortunately, that is what I'm saying. Whoever attacks wins the mark whoever attacks gets to the new cycle. Most quick, and I think that his best overall response is going to be continuing to attack or, and one of the reasons why I think this campaign is going to be intensely nicknamed is because neither of these guys is  the boy who can skate on the charm. Is it possible when attacked? to respond simply with the truth. There is it always better to respond with another attack. I am not speaking as a moralist. I am speaking as a clinician. I can tell you that I do not see clients that have been immediately forgiven for confessing certain things. Moreally, I think that is disquiet, but in terms of reality as I look over my clients over two decades, I have not seen in correlation in microrear between confession with a gibberish. And do you find this something probably honest that even morning to get the attacks out of the pot? So that is, did you  the effect in a deeper way? There's nothing wrong with these attacks in pot. Well, I don't think that all of these attacks are nearly as destructive in as new public likes. So I just think it's some level attacking those. fairer down truth. The problem in my view is differentiating between attacks that are plotted to date and attacks that are just point smears. But but in the case of politics seems  kindness here is one sees or or things that that they have an element of it but but how much food they have is a bit much of a choice or saying that a person or say anything to get away. The relationship is element truth. We all have seen that. in the same thing on the conference, , he hasn't seen boy, he hasn't seen my company, all this kind of process. Yeah, I think that these are examples of tax that we are legitimate. The fact is, these so-called tax are really a part of a broader debate that get to certain critical questions. Look, I believe that even the questions about who is alleged drug use are germinated, because I believe that, this that one of the things that is nagging at a lot of the country, this is true of John at Kennedy's well, is, is it a healthy thing to have a rich kid who has never had a tough day in his life, sitting in the oval office? Whether or not the allegations one by one is true, isn't as important as the fact that the broader questions are being asked, and frankly, I don't think it's the most unhealthy thing in the world. There hasn't been lack of nickels, tests, auto overflow, placed in Spanish andにage-wooP is book about his craft. Do you pay a sage by the G? Do you pay a sage by the G? Do you pay a sage by the G? Do you pay a sage by the G? That's right. When it tax really count, oh, you think that's me. Just remember during your high school. That's when the character assassination really hurt. We have this story. I guess this is about this name and name. Day 9 of Team Friends in fourth and Friends through sixth and I have to describe this place. That's a huge part of this person. He was still his extreme, wierry person. Very thin. He looks amazing. And he also gives me his what you've noticed in your own cover. It's always very sad. And he just took a selfie. He was very neat, quiet, kid, very soon. Nobody ever really noticed him. He was , oh, no, he's in front of him in class together. He's in grade school. And our favorite group was those people. And he was all in front of us. And he's all in front of us. And he's a hazard. another one in Star Wars. It's very big things and as things progressed into fifth grade, we can pretty clear that our friendship was the most intense friendship in the class. The teachers started separating us in the classroom because  her first days. We then seen a girl 달라 on the ground and when you're feeling exposed. This girl is literally theHelp. I basically discovered sexual interference and we used to, I remember the first thing that we did together that was sexual interference. We went into his parents' bedroom and we got the Jason Concert Law and looked through it and went to the Braun Antisession. First time i had verbal interference. And then the other thing that we did, the other thing that we did was we used the placement bottle and we would take off the clothing when we went to landowners. And it was the first time we ever been thinking for the first time, it was a pro-bearance. And it was petrified, but it was also just this whole discovery period to see another man get there. And it became this whole game, , often. And we just would revel in the fact that you're standing here and trying to tell me how to get a suit. It's character, just , no. Hi Mr. Jones, how are you? Nice to meet you. Businessman and I'm a designer. Fuck Nick. And so terrifying to be here every time. Because the parents will always hang me on the phone. So I'm just hoping something will happen. The point that started the change was as we were going to sixth grade and that's around the time when people start to people in sixth grade start to realize that there's different things between the students getting. And there was just rumblings happening. People were too scared to be. We weren't in way. but we also knew of all the things that we had done with each other and each other in the presence. And the fact it was  the most dryatory thing in the hospital. And people were thinking of things. I think for people started gay we suddenly realized that there was a cool thing in that lack in the fresh air. And that's also around that time when in my time, is anything more as well, is where sports just become the most important thing in life. And I was not a good athlete at all. Dave was a good athlete. And Dave organized a big football party. One week, where we were going to go out there, and play football, and have a sleepover. I'm very stapling with Paul. Dave just organized this thing. I'm really looking at Jersey's freedom with numbers and names. He had teams with rosters. He had practice for his team with plays. There was  a playbook. This is  for a little football game. He was a footballer for a footballer. And every single man who was decided to learn from him What we do, where we be. what we eat, food meal needs, when we play football, it's all turned down. It's just, it's so organized and all the time. And so when we get out, when we got out there played, I don't remember very well, but I can't imagine trying to play, just right to say well. There were other people who could have been there. And I was in work, and I think, I was thinking about this today, I was trying to, to think, of the moment when everything changed and I'm almost positive to stand. That's it. It's a fool. And immediately after that, it just took so long to do. I remember going into class, set the grade, first day school. And him not on it. And everybody just wanted to do it. The whole school was wondering why there was this big fight. And I remember just not answering. I used to talk to the past day. I had no idea. And I remember that all of a sudden, just was completely different. Time. Everyone answered. It was cool. And it did it very well. It was one form the IA. They called CooST. They used on the I.A. Cruise Club. He never did anything to me himself. He would never come up to me and we never could have never come to me. He would never come to me and hit. But he would just get everyone else to do it. I remember once I was watching Sam saying, if he would be a club masterman. And of course, either answer is damn you. Answering yes or anything. And I remember hearing Dave song to ask. who's just able to organize these different factions, who's able to shift the focus really well. But from a really guarded position for a way, you just say, , it's just something It's take her there. People would make fun of way that I chew and launch people would make fun. I have to be a big part of that cough. I think that's what that makes me even sound. Less violent ones, it's just a thing. Monkey was a very important one to Monkey, but it's part of it. I remember sitting low at the launch table, I was talking to him, and just wanting so bad for no words to turn attention. Because I'm going to get to the internet. I remember. just not understand what was going on. And I've been in such a sweet position as a person. It's such a friendship, all of a sudden everything just turned into something. That was the worst part of the entire life. I used to go home and sleep around. I used to go to my dog and hug my dog and say, So I took her toisin, So I took her from me and Thenna I remember what did. Once there was this guy Mike in my class and Mike was what we call in my town, in his commer, which meant that he was on welfare. Perhaps didn't have a parent dance for a minute and a week. He was, , very smart, which was a striking answer. That edge. But he just didn't fit in. into no teaching. And so Dave organized this fight into Mike and I, a fist fight to Kluke, who was the bigger fact, where we were able to speak a fact. And he positioned us, he spun it so there was no way I could not fight. If I didn't have this fight then I would just be things would just give worse. Things would give worse. I mean, Mike was  at the bottom of Barrel and I was there with Dave had to prove that I was below. And so. your differences in flight. And everyone in the class was , you flight right here, right right? And I finally just succeeded. I can see the flight. And , Dave worked on the whole day. It was to happen in this playground. And , we went, tried to get this whole lot of things to come and see it. Unfortunately nobody came at him. But he's fortunate. Nobody came with him and ordered a person. So Mike and I went there. And neither of us aren't fighting, either of us in any reason will fight each other. So I just remember standing there facing here, just  laughing, just  what was supposed to do. We're standing here, we've been forced into this just to save our own souls. And now we have to , reflect pain from each other. And we stood there for the longest time, Dave kept, Dave kept trying to push us in the fight. We're saying, ah, it's so punch, it's so punch to start. We waited for the longest time, and finally, you have to. I was just  this when I came. So I went up on our shop and then we started to fight. We were really into fighting, but we had to do it there. And I pushed him at 1.0, he fell backwards and he was missed. And I got on top of him and I held his wrist. And I remember saying, dude, you give up. And he wouldn't give up. And I was holding his wrist back. And each time I kept asking me if he was going to give up, he kept saying no. And each time we'd say no, I'd better just . and he was crying and I can say I would have been the back, I'd have been the back, thinking I would have been the first person I had no reason to break this person's rest. And I was facing that moment with either giving up and just getting kicked even more or going ahead with really hurting this person and hoping that it would save me. And I broke this rest. Continue to the next day in school. The cast. And the mouse families changed into candy. Everybody saw that. Inside was it. The callers wanted you to do idiot. They made it. It just made it work. They didn't know reason for us. He didn't understand himself. He didn't think to listen. This will reaction to this sound, , it's a variation of a massage well as it can. And so he, in order to preserve himself, just pointed to some analysis. There it was. And it really turned with him. And I think that people got age. are looking for them. Things  this. Those are grades where you are forming factions, you're forming groups and the easiest way to be part of group is to just point somebody else and say, I'm not  him. I'm not  him. I'm not  him. I'm not  him. I'm not  him. I'm not  him. I went to the Cosmic Government School for the Arts and we're reaching here. So I'm a little bit advised here to see here. And I remember very clearly there was a moment at cover school where I thought that the clouds just cleared everything. Awesome. It was after lunch and we were going to have a tourion. I forgot for a bag. And I worked and I still just went back and I went down to the capture. Got my bag. We keep back up and they're still there waiting. I remember so distinctly remember Oh my god, this people Wait, it's That meant so much to me Because I felt There are people out there I am not this I'm not this idiot I'm not a person who ever would should eat I'm actually pretty good in people  me But because I was now from maker and to state in New York It's so good Well, I've forgotten what's produced today by Julie Snyder and myself without Bloomberg, Susan Burton, who's shabby name production often taught Bachman and Mary.
