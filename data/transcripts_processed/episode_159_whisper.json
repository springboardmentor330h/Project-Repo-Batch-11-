  "text": "This American wife, I'm Iron Glass. This is story by Tilly Olsen, in which Mother of Five stands at an Ironing Board, contributing a note from the teacher. That's where the common space world is taught her. She's a youngster who needs help from it says, and who I'm deeply interested in helping. The Mother Moles is over. Should she go in? What is it even to say about Adorno's life? Here's Tilly Olsen, right? Even if I can, what does what it do? You think because I'm her mother? I have a key or that in some way you could use me as a key. She's lived for 19 years. There's all that life that has happened outside of me, beyond. And when is there time to remember, to sit, to blame, to ask him to choke him. I'll start and there will be an interruption, and I'll have to gather. all together again, without the commential with all ideas or did not do, with what shouldn't be in and put him up, be help. And then, as she stands her ironing, she reviews her daughter's life, point by point. From the baby she was, the lawsuits of couples and mistakes, are working mother are trying to be different children, trying learning as she goes, making it up as she goes. Until... At the end, she finally comes to this beautiful passage, some of us in psychopieded glists, but everything which can happen when it's trouble. I will never told what all I'll never come in to say. She was a child, seldom smiled at. Her father left me before she was a year old. I had to work her first six years when there was work, or I sent her home into his relatives. She was talking. been and foreign looking in a world where the prestige went to blown as in early air. And dimples, she was slow with witness's eyes. She was a child of anxious, not how, well, we were poor and could not afford for her the soil of busy growth and this is well-mudden. I was he distracted mother, they were the up. children pushing up demanding her younger sister seemed to be all she was not. There were years she did not touch her. She kept too much in herself for all of us such that she had to keep too much in herself. My wisdom came too late. she is a child of her age, of depression, of war, of fear. Never be. So all that is in her will not bloom, but in how lonely does it? There is still enough left to live by only, how pertinous, help make it so there is pause for her to know that she is more than this dress on the ironing board. I hope you see I'm... Being a parent is in the proposition. I think it's going wrong. As in any daily education, things go wrong. And in the end, so many mothers feel appreciated. Mother's who take and pergran it. This is as what it's best. A mother. In fact, it's my mother. Shall we class? Jesus. I called it in the spotlight. I was wondering if you've noticed that every year since we started this American light four and a half years ago, we've done the father's day show, but we've never done a mother's day show. Actually, I never noticed it until you pointed it out to me. Okay. I guess I've become accustomed to ignoring those kinds of slides. Okay. Why have a generic answer for that? You do. Yeah, why you've done five of these dishes and haven't done the other dishes because mothers are taking care of it. how do you mean? Well, for example, I do somebody who told me about the summer that he was a camp and his mother wrote to him every single day and his father wrote to him once and he kept the letter that his father sent. The rest of us. because it meant so much. And you didn't keep any of the letters as Mother said? Well, it was that because it was so surprising that this father would be emotionally expressive, where his mother was always emotionally expressive. Exactly. The child is so secure with the mother that he doesn't need to hold on to a souvenir or a symbol that she cares about him. That's what I just said that you take me. mother's for granted. Obviously, some others believe the mother's taking for granted. Today on a program, we tried to write this terrible wrong and our small little way, here on the radio, the stories for Mother's Day. WB EZ Chicago, Public Radio International, we just need to do this American life some other day's show. I'll probably come today in three acts. Back one, she said she said, which Alex will broken that's an investigation. Perhaps the first ever, with people who compulsively imitate their mother's voices in everyday conversation, well into adulthood. Back to, are you my mommy? What if what teen year-old was sent into adult prison in Florida, the state did such a terrible job to take in care of her, that, incredibly, several, in a pezzler, convicted murderer, and sedatives, stepped in to mother her. That's right from writer Alex Kottowitz. Back three. Mom music Go Araly confronts his mother a better dirty little secret joddy cash Stay with us At one she said she said There are as far as we could tell no scientific studies proving we're about to assert our evidence is anecdotal and preliminary We invite the scientific community pick up the thread where we need Findings this far I think We have discovered that there is a vast subset of American families. Across its all-social classes, in which the children do imitation of their mothers, all the time, even into adulthood. What does it mean? How it's remembered, it's all. In my own scientific survey, I can tell you this. It's always people who have close relationships. His mothers are still powerful forces for them to end up imitate them. What's always striking is how did these interpretations are? Money. was a child of comfort and Milwaukee and a typical conversation with my mother or my favorite thing that imitated her is in the morning we would be children she's coming to room the wake us up and there were three girls in the room and so she would come in every morning and she would first wake up my sister Sharon and Sharon with the hardest one to wake up and so every morning she would come to room and she'd go Sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen sheen no you can't help but sheen sheen get her sheen on the wake up the rest of the baby's trauma sheen get No, I don't know how you don't want to get sham She I know you sham She I wish you would get out of that bed Gow get up and that with every morning It would always start out very soon See See See It's not sham run See See See See She She She She She She talked all the time If you would say, , I'm studying now Go, just grab a bag And comes See See See And look at that book, we didn't have what we did, we didn't have what's on the screen. We had Little Lo's Lane, and you put your name on there, we'll some chalk and then we'll be done. You just wipe it by the door! That's how that worked back then, John. John has been entertaining for Mother's and she has 4 or 5 years old. She says originally, it was the beginning of the mocker, from other talks of countries, she says. So then she started maturing him up. for a different place after her father got sick. She was different from others. Her voice actually changed in the time. It came not so much out of her throat but it hit her heart because I think that everything she thought that everything she would say, particularly to him, maybe the last thing. And so her voice actually changed in the time. Her voice got very low. It wasn't , I didn't know what that was . It was where she thought she someone was blind. I was trying to find the way that we would treat themselves you to a different level about something. People stole 황ißen, and we wanted you to haveed enough time to choose to do something. You had to write your own stories here  you. There's probably more within the background than someone would harp. Lord, everything is just a small part. And it's so small and I just, and the sheared it would always say that she heard everything before. I just don't know, but he's just keeping so safe. And then everything starts the salmon. That he will be the one calling out. How you doing? What I'm doing, fine. Everything's all gone. She was busy, fine. Even though there's nobody, she's talking about hurting her house. She's, she's talking about the mask. That mask. During the whole, I would say last year was live. She was taking care of her, but we were taking care of her. So we spent a lot of time talking to her and talking to my sibling about her. So I think when we got support, we were always calling each other. And my phone was  three or four dollars, and we were all talking about it in one of the months. We would imitate her to each other. But it was more of a way to relay this information. in the way they didn't hurt so bad. It was easy for me to call my brother up on my sister up and say, , just doesn't  anything, you call it to. No, just is complaining about this and the grass ain't cut. Now I want to my grass cut in four or three people then didn't shop before 30. I had to put that long on my cell. It wasn't so hard to hear. I always wanted and I think my sibling probably was one. Is it as bad as she said it is or is, and so by imitating her, trying to get it and close to it's confidence. It is conveying more information. , they didn't cut that graph in 4-3. There's a lot of different things. All these things are different. That's just, we're her voice and flight type. It's , oh my, somebody get there now. I don't know what that was. Cut that graph. She's fine. She's compliant as she's fine. In our family, we always imitate it. Power mother to each other. Another thing I can tell you is one person living in this world. Every person. Take joyous means. It was actually a main source of bonding between the kids. Of us telling each other stories of something she said or did. to each other. Okay, for example. My sister Megan Lisen, Japan, if she and I are talking about my mother, she'll say, well, , I call mom and dad last week and dad's her reading more books about dogs. He's still considering getting a dog. I had a great talk about that and then mom said, well, I don't know why you chose to move 10,000 miles away. A person who decided to move 10,000 miles away from their family must have some reason for moving. And you should think about that. Why you can be 10,000 miles away. And then we'll laugh because one of the reasons you are 10,000 miles away because someone near you could be saying, say, fine, let's see. My mom used to do these things , she had weird confusing. It's kind of  the money thing confusing gift. she would say. for your birthday, I'm going to give you $50 towards that $200 microwave I want you to have. And then you would say, well, then I have to spend $100 on the microwave and I don't even want that microwave. And you'll say, no, I checked out all the microwave. I've gone to the sear, if I've gone to the barn, I've gone everywhere. This is the microwave for you to have. But I have a budget on your birthday for $50. I thought if I... down the first 50, you could pay it off over time and then that would be my birthday gift. I think hard of it is to offset what may be uncomfortable with a funny way of imitating something that if you weren't imitating my biggest plan of setting up a house. Well, , it's just ... easier because it distances you from a person and then you can imitate them and then look at them as a funny way. In some ways what your brain is saying is I'm not them. I'm so not them. I'll make a character that's them and say what they would say as them. That's how much I'm not them. that. Algorithms ... You can just make these emotions per year which is just it? starting out. She would assume the character of her mom sketches, brownies, comedy, and mom. But when her mom can't see the shit, she pulls the shit. It was the same, which was on Saturday and July. One skit was based on the second. My mother would always tell, it's actually so funny to me. She tells you the story of a movie from the point of view of the character who is most  her in age and point of view in a matter of how small that character is in the mood. So  if it was wrong, you'll be on July. I'm she's saying I saw a movie about this nurse and she has this she takes care of this call and his 14 very rampant function and part of the marriage and she had a hard time controlling her and she runs off with a boy that no one wants her to be with and everyone tells her she doesn't know what she's talking about and the nurse is very concerned about this girl and of course they end up dead So I'm gonna do this on Eskmel and then I just put it I was too nervous about I just didn't want her to see it. I wanted to protect her Eventually Julia's mother did seriously In Julia's one woman show God said Even after several years another still recall certain seeds that said Which Julia understand? Mother's have feelings on the other hand I have to stay it's a way of loving them and enjoying them maybe in the only way you can. Because I have a huge amount of love for my mother and I really enjoy her, but one way I think I learned to enjoy her was to make her a character to me that would also funny. And sometimes my mother says incredibly insightful truth thing. And maybe it was a way for me to feel or intimacy with her in some weird, inside out, purposeful to have incredibleVERDADバイ Want tonizies for free. to a character and then relating to her as a character and in some way even allowing that character to have really true insights. One of the paradoxes is the exposed certain aspects of her personality, the sightseeing to him, but he's simply applying to her characters, the personality of the whole. Sir Akhen, his mother was born at her seats, it still has her rootschaxes. So this is because her portrayals were huge chunks of her. I think the character of my mother that I play is more daughter-in. Sort of talking all about. I went to the fish shop and made a path of an tuna. So I got salt, fish, fish, pots, irritate. , this kind of bumbling, city English woman. And she's actually not really  that. She is really a person in what she is. All the more enemies where pretty Mars is. I had to do it. So I don't know if that is. And I don't know how you make that. So if you can't, I don't know if you bring that up. So she's always trying to get you or my brother or my sister to do chores by you. Bye. She builds them as fun because we're good together. So say oh Sarah Helping the god in the bit The L. Mom, please. I'll come in here a little later. Oh, Sarah. So so much fun when you do it together She gets a lot Why does she get fuckers because it's such a ruse so clearly a risk. It's never. It's not fun Sometimes they were bad jobs It's so much fun if we do it. Hello, Missy. This is Alex. Hello, hello. Well, it seemed unfair enough to consult the real protagonist. I called Sarah's mom. She knows Sarah's interpretation quite well. I would make my usual little family. So when we were gardening and I would buy to buy some gardening and say now let's do a ghost gather and we'll be talking to him. I'm sorry I would say this back to me with a little plum and I realized that I was standing a third. So there I wish they would come to help me and I do think this is a ghost but he was würde by XZX and I stood one. In fact, Sarah and her mother both remember her time and Sarah didn't do it. When she was two afraid of her, she didn't come from her. And they both remember the exact moment whenever it was. My sister and I were quite, she did all the time about. Honestly, usually. And one time I started out with fighting horribly. We must have been  10 and 12, 9 and 9 and 12. Alright, I- could have wrangles any longer, I think. It was endless, I'm always wrangling and pricy. Oh, let's go, let's go, mother, deserve it. I remember exactly where it was in the house. And there's tiny little alcover, this, of course. I mean, there wasn't even room for the three of us. And my mother got so fed up that she grabbed my sister and me by the collar kind of. And then I fell in love with her, but I would buy my head together. They didn't go. and they didn't stop by behind their head together. And then what happened? And they lost! And then what happened? And then what happened? And then what happened? And we started laughing and control. I was so absurd. And you could see she wanted to laugh. But she could it. It was this critical moment of this point and she couldn't. I was really shocked. But it's a carpet machine that goes squares there right. And that too. I'm sure it did. But it's two doors open. Alright? But what happened? Why did we open? So for a while all the others dealing to the Maiden that we keep. Yeah, everything went fine. But案? Before we went this wrong. For what? Er... Seriously? That was that one... Huh? I was guilty in horrified, and I was mad as well. I think the realization at that moment was we both knew that my mother was never going to discipline us the same way. that there would be no more girl. I was just  that because it was too absurd. I'd pay from up here and a first Harry and mother to a figure of mine. What are you talking about! I went from sort of, , being afraid of her wrath to kind of... Mocking. But she knows it. She talks about it. That's another thing she said. So awful. But you wait. Do you have children? And you go from a figure of fear to a figure of pot. Mocking. Mocking. Mocking. Mocking. Mocking. The dream's the ideal dream. The dream's the most beautiful dream. A dreamer I do think that. And it's freedom from work, exactly. Well, , , I'm kind of, I'm a bit over there in person, and the path of a different way. So at one point, that's a, which came back up to us. As time has made peace. What path do I have to give you, and I have to give you a new, and I have to keep your path it.

I took a very good sleep because it makes me feel myself in a different way. And sometimes it's very lovely. And it makes me relax and not watch so all the time. It makes me a long time.

Generally, I really wouldn't mind becoming my mother. I really  her. I wouldn't mind becoming her, but I definitely need to edit her. And I think when I imitate her and I'm making fun of her, those are the parts of her that I... and would edit out of myself. If I have to become her in a longer, then I'd  to not become those parts. If I can isolate those bits, and repeat them frequently, perhaps they can avoid them. Coaching the anchor but then it takes your breath. Johnifer talks to her mom on the phone almost every day. Sarah recently went with her mom to help Spongebob. That's a great, and actually kind of relaxed. And Julia just spent 10 days with her mother and spoke hand. She came back with nothing.

We've arrived at Act 2 of our program, Act 2. Are you my mommy? Pepper settings in Los Alacrusted Country resulted in more teenagers being bumped up in juvenile court to adult court, where they get adult sentences. And if you're saying 14, you get sentenced to serious time  this. In most states, you will serve the first few years of your time, and the juvenile detention center. Supposed to sign for young. But make you get a school, get a facility, train to deal with him. But in some states, you can get sent right away to adult prison from the start. 7,000 young people are adult prisons right now. And of course in that situation, the state has taken on the job of being your parent. And it isn't always too good here. Alex Patloitz has the story of one teenage girl who was sent to adult prison in Florida. And the prison did such a sloppy job, caring for him. And when he set up his job at home, there are other prisoners, step in. Just a Robinson is a slender girl with emerald green eyes, for hair on this day, styled and short bob. Her forehead is marked by a light taste back and we met in an office at the Gade Correctional Institute, sprawling prison comrades, flies on the edge of hearts and her bodies. We sit and chairs need a neat, Jessica stretches, arching her back. She answers many of my questions with the phrase, yes, no, she cracks in my nose. She gathers, she snatches a piece of paper from the desk and rolls up tight. She picks a lamp off of my microphone. She tugs at the hem of her prison, and she may be bluest her. She is to put my object digital. Were you scared when you first got the prison I asked? Scared when I went to depth? No! What do things you missed most? Have you fun? Go now with bar remain because we usually have a beach step. Point shopping. Go on movies. Go on to the shop. Do you want to pop these in the windows? If you get out tomorrow, we'll be the first eat. Oh, I'm going to talk about eat. Go to Taco Bell. Yep. And a taco. Just as 16, the youngest prisoner here today, she's a girl among women. She's been in prison adult prison for two years, and the serving of nine-year sentence Arm robbery can fit more. But I'll get to that short. In July of 1998, Jessica arrived in the first stop in the Canna jail, the Jefferson of the original institution, and all women's prison in your talent has she is for... She had long dirty blonde hair, felt a little smaller back and she was red thin. Shortly after her rival, she met Suzanne Manan, who was serving 30 years from 1000 years. The first time I ever saw Jessica, is actually sitting in a childhood Jefferson correction institution. There had been a lot of rumors going around about this little girl. It was at Jefferson's considered kind of a tough prison. There are three gun towers that's creating intimidating, very strict. You walk another little yellow line on the side. of the walkways. So in the childhood I heard all the rumors when I saw her walk by I wasn't shocked because when you looked at Jessica and this was yours ago now a couple years ago Jessica looked  a child who chinks for Rosie Red. She still looked she had baby fat on her and she looked totally lost. Not too long after I first saw her she moved into my dorm and my heart just broke. to talk to her. She was a child. She was a baby. She was thrown into this hell hole and didn't help clue. Suzanne Manning's 39. She's a handsome one. For six years in prison, you're trying to curly hair gray. She became the first and a line of women to watch her quote to her. Well, I thought I would start helping her with some school work. We went to the library and they had kind of a children's section and Jessica ran over and got a book, the Little M... me and wanted me to read that book to her and I think it brought out a lot of my material instincts because my son was 13 when I came prison and I missed a lot of those times with them. So being able to sit and read with Jessica was just it really did both of our hearts. Jessica was born in Austin, Texas. Her father was in her one in the morning, Jessica's mother. Lisa, he physically abused her and the daughters. When Jessica was three, Teresa fled to Miami in her house. There she waited for Snipes and Demons, and by her own admission wasn't a very patient mother. She and Jessica fought frequently. When Jessica turned 13, she began to run away from home. One staying away from three weeks. She was detained in a juvenile facility on three occasions. All of us all living in the family's father's. Once she flew uppated logms. another time she'd better mother on her hand. Teresa told me she'd called the juvenile guard, hoping she could get her daughter so she can't take help. She had no health insurance. Indeed, it is psychologists to suggest good intention. Recommended that she'd be placed in a residential program. She could see that there are nothing ever keen that's just she was released a few days later. At one point Teresa sent Jessica to live with her grandparents, but Jessica clearly alienated them as well. She had some nice voice错ess somebody HCQ She argued with them and they too called the authorities, Jessica Sutra Vange. On a late Saturday night in July of 1997, Jessica, who was 13 and two other teenagers of Boy in a Girl, showed up her grandparents. Jessica and the other girl snatched through the entire task of a boy forced to two grandparents and night-pointing to a bathroom ordering the team on the floor. The boy threatened to kill them with a flower pot and at one point cut the grandfather on the Mil consideration for the child. the three were arrested a couple of days later. Under Florida law, the state's attorney could choose to prosecute Jessica as an adult and did charging her with arm key metin arm lover Jessica played guilt. Her mother wasn't present for the sentence she'd married a servicent and pilot and criminal. The court just got initially accused of apologizing for grand powers. And that's the... I'm seeing the Dutch hold just to the hood of the hood of the hood. The Dutch also told Jessica and I quote, I don't think we need people  you in our country. She sent them stress in our needs. Jessica became the youngest girl in Florida's both Christmas. Suzanne Manning, then and her just in the slide. I couldn't imagine being a child growing up. I knew what my son at the age of 13 was eating. When I left home and I knew how important snacks were, I knew how important chips were. juice when we wanted it and then all of a sudden to realize here's a child in prison who couldn't eat when she wanted to eat and sure everyone would chip in and buy Jessica snacks and stuff but do  what it's  to feed a child that on $30 a week? I mean it's super cheap boss. We used to look at her at night thinking what can we do to get food for her? It was horrible. prisons are pretty strict and touching and it's called on off-rac physical contact. You can get a DR disciplinary report and go to confinement court and many times officers would catch me hugging Jessica or rubbing her head or her head on my shoulder issues crying and they wouldn't say anything. They just walk past it and I understand that they couldn't encourage it or acknowledge that they saw it without happening right now because they would have to write keep the rules for everybody. There's not a rule that says if you're court to your 15 someone can. hug you because you need a hug. They would let you. Many times. Many, many times. There was one time in our dorm. When I walked in, everyone got real quiet and a little circle was formed around. And the back around people. And Jessica was in the center of it. And then I didn't recognize her voice. And she was in an argument with the school and they were just going. and the circle had been surrounded around by adults who wanted them to go. And I actually got the Chameen to everyone and I took Jessica and pulled her up to the office station. Now let me guess Jessica must have really pissed at you. Well at the beginning she was, I'm not gonna say she wasn't, she told me that , that she needed to prove her point and she's staying in love with all the rest of those conwards but she didn't need to do it and she ended up being okay after that. person, this is really big for her, she said she could remember Christmas is of her mother. And I remember one Christmas. One of my friends, I'm Susan, nature, is sick, I'm she melted down to her she bars and may just get Christmas tree out of her she bars that will melt and she makes some nuts in it. And then, , she took MNMs and smashed them up and put them on top to make it It was lights and shape that I love and get it hard and gauges. that and I ran out to the story. I thought of it at the last minute. I hadn't even thought that she was a child when it was Christmas time and she might want something. So I ran out to the store and I got Jessica radio and some headphones and some batteries. When I came back in my game I gave that to Jessica, she didn't stop hugging me, she jumped up and down. And then I realized what a solace that was to her to be able to listen to the music and she stayed on her bed after that and didn't bother us pretty much. She could listen, she knew what was going on. She walked around with that at Rack and... Why didn't I think of that before? She's a child, so do you  these? Jessica started calling Susan Mom, but Susan discouraged. She started that mom, you're my mom, night sat down and told her I'm not your mom, your mom is in Germany, and I'm just using it and I don't know if anything I can help you. And a lot of people think that's cool, I don't think it's a reality. Another reality, another reality is... is a few, if you try to be in groups  that or bond  that with people here, in prison, you get shipped. I mean, you can get shipped today. This morning they could have opened the up and said, you're going to date. I'm Tuesday, they can make me have been saying you're going to law. Jefferson had one shipment day and that was Tuesdays. People were shipped on Tuesdays. Every Monday night I suggested you realize that I can be shipped tomorrow. You can be shipped tomorrow. Suzanne was transferred to another prison. She wrote the Children's Advocacy Center at Florida State University's Law School. detail in her concerns about Jessica. Jessica needs more milk, she's in. Jessica receives a prison diet tailored for a grown man or woman and includes only one cup of 2% milk each day. Claudia camp was a lost kid in Clark's state and she took on Jessica's case. Claudia is 47, former hardware store owner and the mother of three daughters. She made a commitment to see Jessica every week. In pretty soon she'd become the second woman to step in as kind of surgeon. just one time she was not feeling well and she just put her head down on the table and said I want you to take me home with you and I said I wish I could take you out of here. I'm sorry you're here. Other time she would say you can just go out for a drive. Can I go to the beach? I wish I could just go to the beach. And it's not even that she was asking to be let out, but just couldn't I go out for a Mahaladian field trip. Sort of what she was asking, or it was a field trip just to go out. It was very hard because I have to, because you have to repress a very natural reaction. Which is to want to take care. She had never been a revisiting path. which is visiting that happens on the weekend who keeps the families because she never had any family. So she had never participated in that visiting schedule. And so I made arrangements to come see her on Saturday. And a friend of hers grandparents were also there on that same day. So it was  a party that we had at say there for four hours. And Jessica and her friend made us lunch, which is another one of these restants they have where they take her idea items from the canteen  spam and oriental rice with season cheetos and they make this almost  hmm i'm not even sure what call it a little corn meal roll or some kind And October of last year, Jessica was second time lost in adult and was looking after her. She was transferred to the date directional institution, which is eight hours from Pella has two far-facordia this and one. And Jessica can't write Suzanne Manick since correspondence between the existing world. Here a date which has 521 remains, just in his found other mentors, which she describes as her prison pen. Two days to mouse. I have a great family. A great grandmother. Uncle's, aunties, brothers, cousins, sisters. And his family would you they watch out for you? Yeah, they do. Her prison family is such an elaborate affair with two of her moms. They're nicknames, blackies, and she's both a Kira, she's the not only girl who has the magic program for her, the father in the forest. How a custody battle, yes? ечь your a ifying they pass I didn't ask Jessica how would you speak to settle but suffice to say that Black E. One, and Tatoo was granted visiting rights in one place in Sundance. Her family gave her a sweet 16-part, making a cake that a pop-pourts, bean cheese and milk chocolate. One woman made a teddy bear out of socks which Jessica took to bed at the time until it was discovered by a guard opposite. Stuffed animal, Ponki. What do you go to here for advice? Meat. So  my father Sarah, she's 21. She's my daughter. She's 21 and she's your great-great grandfather. She's just  great-great grandfather. On the 21. For great-grandfather Sarah Allen, he's in for killing the 40-old man in the whole lot. One mom black along with the complex rob, and elderly couple at their home, the accomplished hackens that's in the shed. Another mom, that's too long. with my complex, school checks from elderly gentleman, for a compass, you can see that. These are the women now I'm just flying. During my visit a day, I met with Jessica's prison stepmom, wandered in, who's serving 22 months for a check for you. I would not say anybody on her day to, she's a bait to me, she's a great, I have a child with two years younger than her. If one of my kids was the combeer at in the same situation as her, I would want some older. to look out for my child also. And I look out for her in that aspect as if she was on a mountain trip. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. If she calls you and you do not move right that minute on she blows up, she's going on. She's going and she's mad. And then when you see her, oh, I don't want to know. You don't never have time for me. I know you. You have time for everybody else. If we're  with Jessica, we just get all the gifts. It doesn't make a difference. Every. It's just a thing. Oh my gosh, she has this little walk. I think it's her little grown-up walk. And I hate it when she does not tell all types of stuff. Walk in  that. I don't know. I can just teach her walking to come out right now. But you think she's gonna don't  walking me just kind of swiveling her hips? Yes, that's the walk she does. Yes, but it's just her own little walk. She's picked up so she's been here. And it just didn't have the top water. Yes, she has it in a way to me. She doesn't. She doesn't have a choice. She doesn't spend with the adults or be at  a child. She acts  a child and she gets a top of that. The fact is this isn't an environment that leaves much room for experimentation. And Jessica's no longer a rosy cheek 14 year old. She'll be 17 in August. She smokes. She curses. She wears dark eye shadow. She lifts weights. Not surprisingly, she suffers from depression and takes a lot of time. the women in Jessica's life worry about. Jessica's mother, her real mother, has re-entered her life, and she and Jessica have had a reconciliation of sorts. They talk twice in law. Claudia Camp, the law student also keeps in touch by phone Jessica. She's helped file a motion to get Jessica transferred into a juvenile facility, where they'd be teachers, counselors, and therapists to work with her. It's also a place where Jessica could be among other children, which she told me. she misses most of all. Towards the end of our time together, I told Jessica I was planning to visit Suzanne Manning the next day. Jessica excitedly recounted the Christmas Suzanne gave her the radio headphones. She then paused. I miss her, she said. Suzanne misses Jessica as well. I asked all the time, anybody who comes from date, I asked a million questions about Jessica. I heard that right after I left, she actually got a G.D. Is that true? I'm gonna fix it. I know. I heard that she got a RIG. G.D. We used to study every night, even on weekends, who worked on homework. It was really hard saying goodbye to Jessica because I guess she knew that I was leaving. I mean, it was pretty obvious. And the next morning I went over and said goodbye. I remember how she just sounded her bad and much  she can't believe I was a mean thing. And , that's a pretty painful thing you made him have to do it. Did she say anything to you? She said goodbye. That was it. What were your pardon words? I told her I love you and I said goodbye. I just love you and said he'll be okay. I don't know that that's me. when I asked an official or today's correctional institution whether it was difficult having such a young girl among adults who reply, we treat everyone the same here. That may just be the problem. There's no one for example to make sure Jessica goes to school. She stopped attending GD classes because she told me the others in class for two noise. There's no one to stop from smoking. In fact, there's a prison fact. a surprise at the cigarettes. There's no one to advise it to think twice before getting a tattoo. She's tattooed the initials of a friend on one finger, and on her forearm has printed the letter round. It was to spell mom, but she tells him she never got around to finish it. Now it's cut with the author of the other side of the river. there are no children here. Jessica Robinson gets out of prison in the year 2006. You look p Huge George Hanging apple Ladores where you need your eyebrows Do one thing wish Do a page call Do your приres Here A necklace H1 nine Boone You say hello my name is Bowen Riley and this is my mother. How do you do this? Listen Richard, John. And the reason is laughing is he changed that along the way. He's now bow and that's the way he's known. I call him that too. And so mom you have fortune. But yes. You need some other thing to do to celebrate me. Do you have any memories you'd  to share? I was remembering that I was thinking about the love but on the certain basis. I was thinking about when I was thinking about when I was still there. And I remember being really little and figuring out a certain point that we listened to about opera and said, and then that the vibe was interesting and opera I could spend more time with. But he also is not interested in running around outside of the season. And so I would come sit by the radio and listen to the app and tell me we've been bumping time for my new community. But you would mostly tell me the story about that. And I really didn't care very much about me, but I loved the music and the sound of how that worked. Thank you. I hadn't heard that before. My memory of listening to the app, or I'm Saturday afternoon, is... more. I would put the little gate up to head from each little child was in the crown stage and I put the gate up and I say I'm going to be in living room listening to the opera if you want to be quiet and listen you can come in. Did he want to make a lot of noise and have fun stay out? Because it was your private time. It was my private time. He is personal. because it was always surrounded by brothers and sisters, just the places so small and young and old time. And so I remember actually , I would calculate little things, okay, my children have to stay home with them. And there was this period of time when I was in my fifth experience . Where I would get this stuff that would come out of my eye, what it was in the public protection. And in my eye, I would wake up in my eyes and this shot in the front. some rude and shut. And I would lie on bunk then with these slices of cucumber. It would be so simple. And I'd lie on them with the cucumber on my eyes, which I guess both the stuff are, and then you would slip these slices into cucumber. And tell me different stories and talk about things. And that is when I remember that you confessed to love a giant catch. Because you would listen to, oh yeah, sh I'm radio. And that is when you were kind of  one's country. music and kind of dorky and rest of us should know about the John Cash thing for him. We love his mom's fault and I love that but you can just miss John Cash. There was a time when I, of course, the many many years I would be up near the night to be ready but there was nothing else I'm ready to go but the bindings and then there's nothing so real people. They don't know. this music at all, this country music, but I  being tamed at the end of this film and of course it also helped me through the night. Yeah. Well, the singing was really, really important for me. And then, therefore, across and across, and that was a lot of what we gave this group of songs. And we sang together. And we just went through this. Do you want to say that? Thinking this is a... Oh... So... oh... Oh.... How does it sound? Is there... Don't think of anything  that. because I was already falling, so I was falling. So, I was falling. And there were schemes and I was at all. And I woke up one morning, and the attic was sucking in. I got out of bed and they fell down in the floor. But, right, my right leg didn't work. It just went to confatine on the door. But somehow the decision was made on those. Anyway, I hope that leg is... sleep and go up. So I went to school and I got to school on the bus because two miles from the bus. And when I got to school, it was obvious that the right still wasn't working, it just wasn't working. So one of the nuns called you, and I think that the neighbor's also been good enough. Oh, and the neighbor went and got you, and you walked from home to the school to get and You came to the classroom and you picked me up. And I still remember how it felt at that point because you put your arms around me and picked me up in the trunk that just turned to pick me up  this. Make with your two hands kind of length together and pick me up and lift it me up and carried me out of the school. And I was taller than you there. And so my feet dragged along the sidewalk. And I remember that the physical sense. and then you carry from that section to the other section to doctor. Which is another mile. Maybe 20 seconds. You carry it in the whole way. And everyone's while you say, okay, now I'm running the stop. And this is what you got. You wait, you keep that cup and you go. And the whole time you talked as a walk. And tell me about your day and do you treat it? as if this was just a long thing. And you made me a very comfortable room. And you knew we would do doctors or nothing to be wrong. They said, we're all going to see them. Wait, this is weird little phenomena. But what I remember most about it was at feeling of being taken care of. Bye, you. Do you remember that? I think I remember it now because I hear the sound. I. I wouldn't have had it in my memory bank until it was brought up. I think that's what mother does.
