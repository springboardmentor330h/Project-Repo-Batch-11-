  "text": "With the holiday season about to begin, it's show about holidays and milestones, well kinds, the days of American life and state views back in front of live audience. When the big day finally arrives, they even waiting for it, it's  the invisible ispades, it's all. Sometimes we'll get it. That's it. For weeks before his 11th birthday, Jason wanted a party at a rollover ring with all his friends. He never had a birthday party. So he invites 11 friends. He's upstick day, party with the fellow resistance. And we waited around, we waited around. We're waiting there for half hour. And then my friends had none of the invited guests or I. So they put us in the room. My mom asked me, where's the, where is he? And said, well, I don't know. And they said they'd be here. They haven't said they'd be here. He's here, he's here. I have this vivid image marked on my brain now cover table and ten chairs around the table and all of these sun days these white sun days are quite on honor and in the chairs and uneven sun days. It's  the last supper. what I mean? I've done the apostles made it. Exactly. This day Jason Stoke did not explain it. He had friends at school. There was always picked first for pick-up The next year his cat cat that was the same age as he was died on his birthday Another year his aunts and uncles accidentally set fire to the back of his house You're preparing for today's program. I have heard lots horrifying birthday stories Matt was robbed on his birthday When's home was destroyed by an earthquake? Sarah had a tree that was planted the day she was born on a 17th birthday lightning hit the tree, burn to the ground. How do you not see that is symbolic of something? Years after Jason's party at the rubbering, the one we know he showed up, his girlfriend still asks him about it and she asks him about it a lot. It must explain something that he is today. And I have to point out again that I don't think that I was a loser when I was growing up. But the thing is as much as I say that it happens. had this birthday party that only one person went to and that that's gonna hold stronger than anything that I could possibly say to convince her that I was not a loser. Certain days have subalting meaning whether we went into our knot. That's why it's important I think to overcome and say, to go big, pure huge party, surround yourself with people, make a lot of noise. That is why my friends today, on the fifth anniversary of our radio show, we have come out here to be with you. this huge theater in the new D.E.S. Chicago, Public Radio International, this American Life, on my request. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Our program recorded today on a four city tour of New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, a co-production with videos. WNYC, WVU are WVEZ and KCRW, many, many thanks to them. Today on our program, birthdays and adversaries, milestones, wall sorts and what do they really need in the way? F1 Pilgrims, progress, several vialtakes up with the family thanks giving dinner by bringing everyone to New York City, babies, crying birds a day in people's sion, Ellis Island, Highland. Back to Kodak moments of the dead. The story of a young funeral director who was updating one of our most sacred and oldest rituals of preparation, doing something that even other funeral directors find very, very strange. Back 3, birthday gift. The festival banks has a story that unfolds so cleanly and increasingly that really I have to say the less said about it at this point better. Music throughout our hour. Just talk about pop music sensation. Okay, go. So, stay here. At one, coconut progress. Beer and Asian who's national holidays usually more about getting together with family and friends and actually commemorating the past. On Labor Day rolls around, we do nothing to many of us with you, the history of the American Square with the place to be in our work been within this town. I will confess that I was actually well into my 20s before I fully understood that veterans day and more your day are actually two separate meetings and not just one holiday that comes around the lot. This is not mean that our big national holidays do not contain deep, commemorative meetings. It's not I think that the meeting is often personal. Sir of Alice, one of our contributing editors, she says this year, a family book with all its traditions and thanks for watching it to an entirely new era. As for me. When I invited my mom and dad to come to New York City to have Thanksgiving at my house, I never expected them to say yes. Not only had they never been to New York, they had never been to New York, they had never been to. of the Mississippi. Nor had they ever visited me. I've always had these fantasies about being in a normal family in which the parents come to town and their adult daughter spends their entire visit date dreaming of suicide. I'm here to tell you that dreams really do come true. I was terrified we wouldn't have enough to talk about. In the interest of harmony, there's a tacit agreement in my family. The following subjects are best avoided in any conversation longer than a minute and a half. National politics, state and local politics, any music by any person who never had lined at the grand old offering. My personal life, and there are so-called God. Five whole days. When I visit them back home in Montana, conversation isn't a problem because we go to the movie set reactor news. That way, we can be together, but without the burden of actually talking to each other. Tommy Lee Jones does the talking for us. Lessons aren't that is a public service. But my sister, Amy, is bringing her shall we say lively seven month old son, Owen, along to the cinema's not an option. Which means five days together just us. no movies. We are headed into uncharted and possibly hostile lands, pioneers in a new world. It is Thanksgiving. The pilgrims have the Mayflower. I buy a gravy boat. It's lucky that Amy's coming with Mom and Dad. Amy still lives six blocks away from them in Boseman. She would act as interpreter and go between them on high parents and me. Squanto! Amy's husband, Jay, has decided to stay home in Montana to go deer hunting with his brother. Everyone else arrives at my apartment in Chelsea. Amy and Owen are bunking with me, so I walk my parents around the corner to check him in their hotel at 23rd. There we are. Says Mom, stopping under the awning of the Chelsea hotel. There she stands, a woman whose favorite book is called Simply Matthew. Right on the spot where the cops halted, Mrs. Outingham, pepsed, after his girlfriend was found stabbed to death on their hotel room floor. No mother, I say taking her arm and directing her down the block to the Chelsea's the boy a hotel where they go to the trouble the teacher reads each day. It is around this time, oh 20 minutes into their trip that my dad starts making making wise cracks  boy kid, bet you can't wait to wear out of here. I father a man who moved us 1,600 miles away from our Oklahoma relative so he would have to feed them anymore. Makes a joke on average every two hours he is here about how much I'm anticipating the second they'll say. Why? I find this charming but so disturbingly true I don't know what to say. By halfway through the first day I discovered I need to have worried about what we would talk about with the baby many years. We have a baby around the baby is the baby. We occupy an entire inner-teenie hour just on drool, non-narrative drool. Then there's the sightsee. First stop Ellis Island. The thing about going to Ellis Island is that it's a lot  going to Ellis. Island. Perhaps to help you better understand the immigrant experience, they make you stand in line for the crammed ferry for an hour and a half in the windy cold. By the time we step on to the island, we are huddled masses here and can be great. Our great grandmother Ellen passed through here on her way from sweet. We watch a video on the health inspection given the immigrants, walk past eels of photos, men, hat, women, and shawls. So no one says anything, I know my father and mother and sister are thinking what I'm thinking. So thinking about when we move away from Oklahoma to Montana, how unknown that was, how strange and loomsome. I read a letter in a display case that says, and I never saw my mother again. And I think my grandfather, how we just grow. off leaving him behind waking to us in the rear of you mirror. And here we are in New York because here I am in New York because ever since Ellen's father brought her here every generation moves away from the one before. It is curious that we Americans have a holiday Thanksgiving that's all about people who left their homes for a life of their own choosing, a life that was different from their parents' lives. And how do we celebrate it? I'm hanging out with our parents. It says, on the Fourth of July, we honored our independence from the British by playing cricket and nibbling on trumpets. Thanksgiving morning, my parents take Owen to see the Macy's parade while Amy and I start making dinner. Let me repeat that. My mother leaves while I cook. Quickly cornbread dressing. I dish my mother. has made everything skimming since before I was born. To her credit, she has not inquired about my process since she found to ask me if she should read Cornmeal in her suitcase. As an Okeet, my mom only uses white cornmeal process by the Shawnee company in Muscogee. She does not even consider my cornbread to be cornbread at all because I make it with yellow cornmeal and heresy sugar. You help make corn. and bread she told me in the same deflated voice she uses to describe my hair. You make Johnny cake. I'm standing at the cutting board chopping site and it hits me what it means that she's letting me be a charge of stress. I'm going to die. Being in charge of the dressing means you're grown up for real and being a grown-up for real means you're getting old and getting old means you are definitely finally totally going to die My mother is a grandmother and my sister is a mother and I have decided the dressing will be yellow this year Therefore we'll all be dead someday Happy holidays aff I have a I did two of my New York friends who joined this pretendner and I was a little nervous about how everyone would get along. My delight, the meal is smooth and convenient. My friends and I talked about the West Nile virus till he birded on Long Island. My father counters with a lovely anecdote about an open copper pit in view that filled up with contaminated rainwater until 250 weeks in one day. Nothing  eating one dead bird and talking. about a bunch of other dead birds, really bring people together. The next morning, right at about the time Owen starts to cry, while simultaneously my mother jams the bathroom door and my father's on his hands and knees crying at open with a pen knife. A cloud passed so quickly. Once you're quite today, I'm in velliff inside what I  to call the impenetrable shield of melancholy. This shield is impenetrable and pain. I cannot speak. I can feel myself freeze up. I can't do anything about it. Everybody in the family goes through these little spells. I just happen to be just one of this particular moments. When people ask me if I'm the black sheep or the family, I always say that no, we're all black sheep. Every few hours they're here, I look over at my death. at nervously crunching speakers together. If you were at home for Thanksgiving, keep ignoring us spending all this time and shock. The thing that unites us is that all four of us are homebody, classarphotes, prepared to be alone and are suspicious of other people. So the trait that binds us together as a family, preparing to keep to ourselves, makes it difficult to be together as a family. Paradoxically, it's... at these times that I feel closest to them. But I understand the best that I love them most. It's just surprising we ever breathe. The next day, we do the most typical thing we could possibly do as a family. We split up. By the time we all reconvene on Saturday evening, my ragged mother becomes so ambitious with her sightseeing that I can tell she's decided that she's never coming back. You guys want to go to Rockefeller Center, I asked, and she says, yeah, because who knows when I'll be back again. Dido the Empire State Building? Because who knows when I'll be back again? If any of you are visiting the Empire State Building, I offer some advice. If you are waiting, the very long line for the very last elevator, and an attendant says that anyone who wants to walk up the last six flights, be... So now, right away, and you are with your aging parents and a sister who is carrying a child to size some of the fact that she stay in line for the elevator. But, if you must take the stairs, go first and you not look back. Otherwise, your parents would look  one of those renditions, breathes, goes and Adam and being expelled from the garden of this house. All hunched over and afraid. So we make it to the observation deck, Brooklyn to the south of us, New Jersey to the west. Places of people fled to from far away. Places of people now run away from to make another life. It's dark and cold and windy, or sweaty , from climbing stairs. Really pretty, though. And there we stand, side by side. I'm sorry, sharing a thought  family we are. My sister wish she were home. My mom and dad wish they were home. I wish they were home too. Thank you. So, so is that she walks out that door You can tell that I'm heroes I'm so good, much better than it ever has before So, my country loves me It's a tough career I'm so good, much better than it ever has before I'm just a little scared of you. I'm just a little scared of you. Please just do think about what you did. I'm just a little scared of you.

Don't let go. One of our producers started coming. What did the funeral of a relative person, Los Angeles? There were four Uricians, and he was started with grandmother Golding. He did a grand STEM-winder speech. Inspiring and living in the parkour. So Golding finishes. It sits back down between her 88-year-old sister, Viva and one side, and started with Yonni Yonni Yonni. Then, in the big TV screen in front of the chapel, the grand mother. not sleeping. She nudges her sister's rib, staged with spring. Huff, you, have her. On screen our pictures of the deceased, black and white on the beach is a young man, a wedding shot with his wife. They would be very goofy shot if you need to dress with the buddies. The photos were selected by the family and set to a musical soundtrack, which was also selected by the family. These being Jews, my people. As you might guess, there's only one real. voice about the music. Really, no choice at all. I can't dream of the old days. Anti-viv, audibly exclaims, Oivea, Grandma Goldie responds, Oivea, Oivea, I'm going to do something. People are crying. The crying wasn't the cry during the youth. later after the burial back at the house everybody watches the video over and over they laughed they cry they rewind they reply Scarborough hasn't had a hit  this since Yen Cole so I went to visit the cemetery where all this happens with the cost of a grave or it crypt includes a personalized video be shown at your funeral to be posted for eternity on the evening Net. To be viewed on video screens scattered simultaneously throughout the cemetery grounds, this whole scheme is the brainchild of the possibly young and impossible handsome high-wark capacity in his brother brand. The group in St. Louis, the dad was also in the funeral business and they brought him around down Hollywood with cemetery three years ago. And Hollywood was 27. We named it Hollywood forever. , it's mind you. I'm just at the same question, sit in it and reverse your mouse own sense. How do you mark the passing time? How do you capture the stand of a life? So we can be commemorated and remember. The power says is the way that most American generals address this question is with a ritual and technology that had that really changed very much since the Civil War. To be innovation during the Civil War was in bombing. Bombing and preserve the person's body for a week or so, but you should them home from battlefield. But during the Civil War it became widespread and it popularized this kind of view goal. kind of  today. The body is dressed up, put on display during the service. You want to confluent into that body so it seems kind of life-frying to influence and want to paint the face. A mortician feels  he's succeeded. The family says, look, he looks alive. Whereas our enhancement to that is that we show video of the person, you need to be there in some ways. captured by. In that media is 100 times stronger than an altered body. Our colleagues were about the idea of having a type of screen in the chapel or near a body. In the same way, they were holding a type of this tradition of embonding, painting, and extreme darkening of the body to try and make it look. live. The moment we put his screen in there, from that moment on, there's always a future increasingly emotion of that service. That's when you started to have everyone crying, that's when you started to have laughter, tears, celebration, that screen when she put that in there, the whole thing changed. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Whenever you listen to this, you will hear the voices of your ever loving mother and your father. I only know it is, mom and dad. This is a video made of a kindly and daring couple named Darthane Buster's shape and sitting on lawn chairs in the backyard. It's not that they're affectionate, they go to each other on, they are genuinely funny. The effort example to story it how the shape was met on school trip to the zoo. Really? On the path of playing a fair bit there, and they're chunky. I think they're pretty, you wasn't kidding. Well, we started dating them and, , every time. We have a date. It rang. I used to call it a ring girl. As it turns out, it's exciting to make videos with somehow captured something that is all about to be zirifer eternity. Pyrene is worth a vacuum and it's done with what we had to do before it was just a project. You get a sense of the shape or something in video, but only because of the wrong force of personality. It's charming. Most of the videos made it the same as telling a lot of characters. So much so that it reminds you of just how hard it is to do. I'm gonna show you how to make a video. At times your heart goes out to the deep in these videos. For instance, when they're asked by the filmmakers to leave the message to the future, you can almost see the flop sweat from the other side. From the side, on the spot. This is a next clip, this one of the videos, made by a 40-year-old, named Steve Goldstein. Who is asked to leave a few words in this video? I guess. I had to say something along those lines that the most important thing in life is it's a learned to love each other, learn to get along and respect each other, respect each other, differences, pretty shaker differences, celebrate your failures as much as your successes as I grow, can succeed without failing. You can use with afterisms  this for a while. Ending with? My last been great. I have no regrets. I honestly have no regrets. Except for some of the stay coming at on a game show once a long time ago, I got to one a lot of money. So from that, I have no regrets. I love you more. Do these as Helen, but we're about that. They come and they go. I did an excellent. It's kind of , I  how I'm going to shoot. I just do it. So emotions are kind of gone. Norman Brown is one of three editors with symbolized videos. A huge work station. A big high. ceiling groom and cemetery grounds. The feeling part of the job is done by women. For women, talk with the families, gather photos, to give shop-by-shot instructions to the editors. This video production goes, this is factory work. 90% of the videos you cut in face jobs, just a series of photos, to peer odd screen for 10 seconds each, with pop song on the soundtrack, going together in a few hours after something guys to play the funeral service. Often a family member narrates and explaining what the pictures are. ever say, , well my dad was in front. No. Never been. Look at  that, nothing at all. We had a hard time seeing eye to eye. If you didn't always get a bomb, I think they would disappoint you in these sometimes. No. You don't get any. How he was a drug addict. He was, , a good father. He wasn't always safe with my mom. Though we have no affairs. Yeah, none of that. If he lost air, he was noer. and all of you think this is not everything is public. Which means I have to say completely appropriate to the occasion and the task can. And any milestone then. And in the first year birthday, , , the National Holiday. I think we do not want the whole future. I think we want this is all they were dealing with honesty in this way. This is not the whole. I mean, you got to look at the purpose of what is the purpose of, , you're going to the street on. moment of that chimera moment of death we do want to see which goes we do want to see the dead in the vision as you are coming. Tyler Cassidy says it's hard enough to get to the death of something alive. Of course it's what we want. Tyler and his brother have only been making funeral videos for a few years and they definitely see it as a work in progress. Something still figuring out. What are the thinking about how you feel? preserve memories, is  tirelessly to start collecting his own scrapbooks, document his own line , he keeps doing these photo albums in his office. When I asked him to flip through the pages, he comes to one photo which he's in detail this story. It's a story of the starts off at a family vacation, and he opens up at this center, at his job, at this video. The photo was a big fishing boat called Ravi Toria, taking a vacation when he was just taking a... and that's what I thought he could make out there. I'm going to move my mother and I let her grow up. I'm sure she was writing this long, I'm pleased to meet her. I was actually gay because I had to learn that I was gay. So for the first three days of this trip, everyone with family was treating me as a liar and died or something. Just not speak directly to me. They were having difficulty looking at me. I'm sure my mother can cut it. this time to get my father and I on this all day fishing trip in what she was supposed to ask me in a certain point and so here we are at being all Marcho and all Victoria. This is the ask you I guess on this fishing expedition which was planning itself to get this new way I asked a test of manhood to be out here and I actually was the one to get the giant tuna. I was really in the tummies as I said. My wife was really hurting my hand. People are gathered around and we always send them again, and then I finally get it out. It's a big beautiful future to the issue. They want to miss out. It's almost human size. It's gorgeous. It falls on the floor and everyone got this running. Stabs it. My streets don't kill it. It's impressive. Telling Mom... And I don't know if that answered my father's question. Tyler had lived in New York College. It's days. Probably the bleep and we fear our business. Each house kind of ironic and so that I was going into on. We have staffs, finally. And... the father's business who was around cascades in death. And they went much deeper into the heart of death when I got there. I was getting, I went there to come out in New York, in 19th, in 19th, in the York, in 19th, in the York, in 19th, I arrived in 19th, which was coming back. The apex of the heart of the epidemic, so it is a epidemic. The epidemic is a epidemic. It is, everyone who is in one, everyone who is who is dying. There's always the thought that we can be dying because of everyone else. And so I think we're good six years. More obsessed about dying and death than I've ever been. And yet at the same time there's more people. people didn't follow any type of condition. I'd say maybe some people threw a nightclub party. And that was in there well. And I want you all to have fun, , to get some drag. Someone else had a down-serimary poetry reading, the form kind of seems broken. And I think that, well, I've been a bit of a funeral. And being broken, it was much more powerful. It served a purpose again. And I think I didn't ever think I was going to go home and return to the business, but it affected completely how I looked at it. I mean, literally you came to feel  the traditional people wasn't powerful enough to contain people's feelings. Yeah. Is it good? It's a traditional thing, one times of clergyman, monology, and some last rights of some sort. I'm not saying to listen, you couldn't have chosen the better spot for adding movies to heroes. The right-hand cemetery in his brother-bought is where lots of luminaries in the first generation of motion pictures of their lives. People  Rudolph Valentino, his worry, Cecil B. DeMell, Luzzi Sigo. The huge piece of land just next door to Paramount Studios backlight. Just to short walk from more Norman and his colleagues, edit these sort of fake sort of real video text for eternity. of the sound stages, with a pleasingly sort of fake sort of real worlds of phraseur and malicia or film. As you walk through the cemetery, you see the intrusion of new technology here and there. These in headstones made with photographs engraved right into the rock, made possible by a new kind of laser and a cuter technology. So far it's mostly Russian and Armenian immigrants to go to this. I'm a man named Simon King, Jacket and Ty, stairs up from his own tombstone with his badass square even though he has passed over to the other side, that's what instill take you down. Not right from there, it's one of the video touch screens in the shade by the wall, you can call up any video they've made, which is in the... Turns out to be a young woman, maybe 30. As a song, can you feel the love tonight, players from the lying, photos flash one, 10 seconds each? She isn't hospital, she is in charge of your shot. baby must be hers, then more hospital photos holding her baby, trying trying small. It is a possibly sad, sadder than I can do today to you. There we are. If you're quite less sad than the sun, cry is going by just your eyes waiting for us. A dead young mom on the TV. Then we're warning somebody with them. I think Tyler's ready about all this. I think if you're just walking by a stranger's tombstone. Southern name Shizu there on the rock. Let me have a look at the sky. Coming up, it's my birthday and I'll lie if I want to. For is it a lie? In a minute, I'll be waiting for National Way Not Club. This American life for my reclace, you can have program of course be to choose some of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, remember it, fifth year in the year, birthdays and adversaries, milestones of all sorts, and we mark them what they mean even when we want nothing. A program today taped on a fifth anniversary tour of New York, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. And I had to say that we are honored at this point, to have a special birthday greeting for the show, a quoted by one of my videos, two of those, three of those for here. It's a pleasure to harvest it for Peruvian Cont 몇. Come here which incredibly is celebrating its 25th year on the end. See you. Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... She recorded this special message for us from her studio at WH51. Okay, guys. F-5 years, huh? Suppose after 5 years, I was still all right, I didn't have to miss it. , kid? 25 years in this crazy public radio game you see a few things You see a side of people just sometimes wish you had Don't get me started to booze the drugs the crazy parties the fundraiser Five years, huh? Leave that a lot to learn until I guess Yeah, congratulations. Whatever. Hope you enjoy your cake. Thank you Terry Gross for that kind message. Act 3. Birthday present. This hotel in Salt Lake City called the anniversary am. Before this building became an institution devoted to commemorating. years of marriage, the building was the Salt Lake City jail. Insert your own cheap joke here. The idea that hotel is on an anniversary or birthday or other big day, what we want is fantasy. There's a room with a draw bridge and a night and armor designed to look  sleeping beauty's castle. There's a hay locked room and a Swiss family robber and tree house and a treasure island suite. That one has a ship's mask and a pro's mask and a sale stretch across the room. You are getting on your job. into a jacuzzi. I bring all of this up because I think of the anniversary end as a testament to the difficulty of introspection. This is if, when a big member did dare rise, the notion of using that number to look bad, to take stock. Try to gain a perspective on who we've been and who we are. That notion is so inherently difficult and possibly painful that many of us, we prefer to leave reality to think. Looking back to a global view, we need to be thinking. Also banks as this story is... of numerous things. And I'm having this. It's about 10pm, 9-1-3 facet middle-aged guys crossing South Main Street and Light Snow. Headed for a quick drink at the Greeks. We've just finished a 30-second degree induction ceremony. at the Masonic Hall in the old capital of Cedarville in the near blood. I'm the tall figure in the mid-worn low, and I guess it's my story I'm telling. Although you could say it was gave a 14-oddestor, since meeting her that night after half the lifetimes that got destroyed. I'm wearing remnants of makeup from the ceremony, in which I portrayed in her appearance. Red lips, streaks of black on my face. here and there. Not quite washed off because of no coping at the hall. The guys tease me but what a terrific miggering. That's the way they talk. And I try to reflect their teasing by ignoring it because I'm not as prejudiced as they are, even no one believes in me. It's an acting job in the 37th year. Not many guys would. We have friends and business and colleagues. I self-living and heating supplies. my friend Sammy Gibson's real estate and the other Rick Buckingham's ship. We enter the Greeks, a small restaurant in Furn Bar, passed through the dining room into the bar and back  regulars because we are regiments, greeting the Greek in his health, small comforts. Sammy and Rick hit uselessly in one of the waitresses, pretty little blonde kid, and make a crack or two about the new gay waiter who's in Furn Bar, and by kitchen board, thank you. The Greek says to me, what's with the Greek name? The Vietnamese. He's not a means. I think he's worth about his patents. But he knows what we do. As we pass one table in particular, this elderly lady in the group looks me straight in the eyes, which gets my attention because otherwise she's just somewhat ablating. Then for a split second, I think I know her. I decide not to keep going. She's a large, baggy, bright-eyed woman, late-cent, spastic in the English. Sammy Rick and I fell away up to the bar, ordered drinks, the usual is coming on the snow outside, and feels safe and contented in each other's company. We reflect on our wives and ex-wives and our grown kids, always. I take around the divide of that thin, silver-blue hair, blue absence. and liver spots in the long slant shoes. With the helmet opening. She's with families some kind of celebration, two sons they look  in the forties with their wives, in a board teenage girl, all five of them overweight, dog, beautiful, and contrast of the old woman, and despite her age, it's smart, aware. All dressed up in the moon, knit the wolf suit, clear the track in the woods. from Sammy and Rick asked the Greek, who's the old lady? The old lady's 80th. We should live so long, right? her. No, I guess so. The waitresses and the gay waiter are saying happy birthday and making the scene that the place is almost empty anyhow from the snow. And everybody seems to  it and the old lady smiles to me. And say to Sammy and Rick, I think I know the old girl from some place. I can't remember. the way customers in the same bunch of things. Rick says the same customer in the ones. Probably an old girlfriend in the same house. A Celtics Nix game on TV has their attention double overtime. Finally the Nix win and it's time to go home guys, snows piling up. We pull on our coats, pay the bartender, and as we leave the old lady's party is also getting ready to go. And when I pass their table s plays The He catches my sleeve, says my name. Says it with a question. One, Warren low, you say, yeah, hi, and smile. It's still I don't be dreaming. Now, she says, I'm gay or fortune out her. Warren, I knew you years ago. She seems, and she smiles for me. And then everything comes back. We're almost in. Do you remember me, she is? Number two. course and give. Have you been? She's been a while. She nods, still smiling. What's that on your face? Make up? Yeah, I've been doing little shit. Didn't have any cold cream to get it all off. She says, I'm glad you're still acting. And then she introduces me to her family  that. This is my family. How do I say, I start introducing my friends, Sally. but they're already at the door. Sammy says, so long, Warren, don't do anything I wouldn't do. Rick gives away from you, Ralph. So it's your birthday. Happy birthday. He says, one thing. The others are all standing now, pulling on their coats, except for Gale. He still has a lot of little of my sleeves, the sheep tongues. And then says to me, sit down. I haven't seen you in one. 30 years. I grew up a chair next to Gale and letting go of the dumb pretenses, I suddenly find myself struggling to see in her eyes. The woman I knew for a few months when I was a kid, barely 21, she was almost 50, and there he, and needs to do that guys were her skinny teenage sons. But I can't see through the old ladies face to the woman's shoe. was. That woman is gone. That's so is the fool. She looks up at one of her sons and says, Dickie, you go without me. Warren will give me a ride. Won't you want? She says, anything. I'm staying at Dickie's house up in the heights. That's not out of your ways. Nope. I'm up in the heights too. Alt and woods. Just look into Congo. Dickie says, fine, little worry. He looks up. that he's used to losing our Guinness of his mother. The Greek and his crew start cleaning up while a gale and eye talking to him is more. Although her eyes are wet and red-rimmed, she's not too, she's smile. It's as if there are translucent shells living in bright blue eyes. Even so now when I look home, I can glimpse her the way she was, slipping around back there in the shadows. We have heavy dark women here. clear white skin smoothest portion. Broad shoulders. And she was tall for a long, almost as tall as I was. And we remembered exactly from the she and her husband once took me along with them to be a W party and she and I dance while we can be friends. When we knew each other, I was the age you I know. Yeah, I guess that's so. Strange, I think it's different. Are you divorced? We look at them. Yeah, I'm divorced. Couple of years now, kids, three girls all grown up. I'm even a grandpa. It was not one of your happy marriages, it was not by a long-shag. I don't think I want to hear about them. Okay? What do you want? Let's have one drink and one short for old times. And then you made the night and came to the sun as home. I say fine and ask. the Greek was at the register tapping out if it's too late for a night nap and shrubs why not. In Gail asked for a sherry and I ordered the usual vodka and tonic. The Greek scoots back to the bar, boars the drinks themselves because the bartender was wiping down the pool of and returns and sess them down before us on the house of some of those back to the company that's been. It's odd, isn't it, that we never ran into each other before this. All these years, you came up here. It counted. Nice day there in court some even after the boys and Frank's job was in. Yeah well I guess 50 miles is a long way. I was friend. Realizing soon that I say it because at least 10 years moving in shape and it's probably dead. He died. Frank died in 1982. I'm sorry to hear you. I want to ask you something Warren. I hope you won't mind if I speak to you, say no. Nope. Shoot. I take the bells and I can't. I never dared to ask you, then. You would have embarrassed you there and I thought because you were so scared and what we were doing here. So unsure of this. What I was wondering, I was what, only one. You were well not scary, but let's say in the past, Mary and kids, the sophisticated woman of the world, seem to me. And I was this apprentice plumbly working on this job away from home. See, you were more than that one. That's why I took to use so ease. You were very sensitive. I thought someday you'd become a famous actor. And wanted to encourage you. You did. I laughed nervously because I don't know where this conversation is going. And take another pull from my brain and say, I've done lots of acting with you. You're so awesome. I love his stuff, some of them. It's hoping. But I kept it up. I don't do much nowadays. But you did encourage me again. You did. And I'm truly grateful. She's tips are sure he's his. I mean, rich, he's. Warren, where you a virgin then? Oh, jeez. Well, that's, that's quite a question, isn't it? Why, sh''n' isn't it? I laugh. Is that what you've been wondering all these years? Were you the first woman I ever made love with? Wow, that's... Hey, Gail, I don't think anybody's ever asked me that before. And here we are, 30 years later. I'm smiling at her, but the air is rushing out of me. I just want to know, Gail. You never said it one way or the other. We shared a big secret that we never really talked about our own secrets. We talked about the secret. We had our little love affair and then you went on a nice stay with friend and we all on you. As old as you are now. Yeah, I'm well, where you, what? Virgin, you don't have to answer anything, I'm just... I hold off a few seconds, wait for some new kid in the bartender of all left and only the Greek is here. Perched on us. stool in the bar watching night night. I could tell her the truth, and I could lie, and I could big off question ultimately. It's hard to know what's right. Finally I say yes and what's I was. I was a surgeon in the kitchen. He was the first one. And she sits back in her chair and looks me full of the face and the smile. This is if I just get in who the one no one else thought she wanted. The gift she never dared to ask for. It's a beautiful smile and grateful and proud, and seems to go all the way back today with me. She reaches over in places who small, crackled hand on nothing. She says, I never knew for sure. But whenever I think back in these days, and remember how we used to make the new, I always pretend that for you it was the first. I didn't pretend. it back there. It was happening. Netsu. For a few moments needed by space. Then I break the spell. What do you say we shove off? They need to close this place up and the snow is coming down. She agrees and I help her slide into her coat. My car is parked only halfway down the block and it's a slow walk to the sidewalk and she's going to see if she's there. When we're in the car, moving north on Mainst. we remain silent for a while. And finally I say to her,  again there's something I wonder on these years, my son. Listen, yeah, but you don't have to tell me anything that is. Warren dear, you reach a certain age, nothing in the rest. Yeah, I guess that's what is. Okay, I wonder if except for me, you state is sorry, and this one. And the hesitation, she said, yes, I was faithful to Frank before you and after. Except for my husband, you were the demon man. I don't believe in her no longer, she's alive. This time it's my turn to smile and reach over in place my hand on her hands. The rest of the way we don't talk except for her giving me directions to her son's love, so just a playing brick branch, an occuring size to be done. up by the moment. The porch light is on but the rest of the house is built. It's laying the same thing. The sun is. I get out and come around and help it from the car and then walk her up the path from the window. She gets her cave in the purse and locks the door in turns around and will soon. She's on his tall shoes. I'm very happy that the sun is reaching the nature since we probably won't see Well, we can't. We still are going to sleep in one, unblad. I wasn't wrong. I don't know what to say. I want kissing and all to lean down and put my arms around them and kissing the loops very gently. Then little more, and she kisses me back with just enough pressure and seeing. So, let me know that she is the moon. We hold each other in a month and a month and a month. Then I step away and she turns, opens the door, and takes one last look back. She's in the house. She's still having a couple of arms, she seems. She's playing, I'm not saying it. Oh, I see it. She can say it's just I'm remembering that she's careful. It probably doesn't take much of her answers. Ocelo, I see. That's nice, and you're the more. Yes, still smiling she gives me a slow pushing wave with her hand as if dismissing me and goes inside. Driving home is all I can do to keep from crying. Times come, times come, times come, times come, things come, things come. What's here in front of me is a more  God, but this is. And as I drive my car through the blowing snow doesn't seem  much. Except for the kindness that I just... Students, for the moment. So my concentration will go down. What's up, Banks?
