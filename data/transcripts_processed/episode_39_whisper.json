Well, when Catherine was here, she insisted that we watch. I would be  hard to get a stop. I mean honestly, it would be  12 midnight. Please one more. One more at the same time. Gotta get a work tomorrow. So please, one more. You bag. Got really sad. I've shared this set of cheap writings. The acting's. It's a god that cars so pop. I've just five days, 96 to 67. And of course, it is not snips. Snips. The young James Kear, sister of Darkshadows, gets scared to the actress's lips, even lipstick. From WB's Chicago, it's American life, and it is the special Halloween edition of our program. Today we bring you stories of things that are supposed to be scary, but are not. At one, Darkshadows, back to scientist in a haunted house, at three vampire girl. or discovering evil at five, end girl and at six screams. There's your screams, your screams as left on our voice now. I'm your ghost, I mean host, I read last. Stay with us. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I learned that John's apartment about Darkshed is, is that the main point of it, the main pleasure of it, is watching things mess up. So you see, just reflect on our thoughts about the form that, so I don't notice the vision of a small picture. It's  watching car races for the car crashes. And if the car crashes, it's just came every 10 minutes in the middle of the road. This American life putty serenance, the update night, wearing a chance of apartment for, I'm not, 10 minutes. When a wearable, exited a scene and threw the open door, we could all witness this figure. Not a shadowy mysterious figure from year 1896, but instead, I was just the prop guy, just the prop guy, please, you're a look, oh yeah. He's being serious about that. Now that I  World of Human Monsters, I think I should be the monster, now, the monster of the human world. The original name exists here. There's a lot of re-winding in playing this video, which John T. Dr. Sidebar Channel. John attacks an arrogant watch after his forget lines. They've seen scripts left on beds. They've seen props, follow over in smash. Priyodacly, there's an offstage cough, and what text describes as the sound of a giant zipper. The series is explicable and not part of any story. When the vampire barn of this common centrist before your or a Collins wouldn't matter, he closes the door behind him, and the mom credits swings open. There's something wrong with a lot. And it's always swinging over there for something close to it. This is kind of a moment they would work. Giant terrors in fabric with shows fantasy. Chances that modern TV shows movies are way too slick. What he likes are things to read a whole or a perfect book of. His house is filled with huge, serpolate paintings that he's picked up at brush sales for recordings we can hear. things follow studio. The best pace monitor film  in the end of the day is awesome which will let us see high production happens. Backshadows as we can scale. you notice  the little things you wouldn't notice in the regular show  we noticed tonight the people have stopped knocking on the door three times. They're now knocking on the door four times. The John things they had on a lengthy meeting decided that you have to have four knots instead of three spiced up plums. the new director said, , we got to get rid of this old, the old ways things are going to change. No more of this three knots. Tony's also stood for obsessed with trying to figure out exactly when the episodes were filmed. Sometimes there was a point. Night. 1969 episode suddenly all the characters started saying groovy freaking by his calculations the episode that we're watching this night probably filmed in February 1969 One clue is in the summer when it's summer you could hear the air conditioner running yeah Yeah, you see the flies and you see the flies. I've never a lot of I mean, it's  they lived next   the studio was a student alley that had been perished upstairs because there's always flies up It's  the thing that's so amazing. there's scenes where flies are sitting all of this faces and they're pretending that they're not there. It's kind of a character study which actors decide to shoot the flies away and which ones ignore them and continue greatly through the scenes. The classic flies see this slide one. Somebody was doing an exercises that flies as likely as fouled. So just what is that? Just hear a little bit. What's interesting about all this is that not only does it defy the way you're supposed to watch horror films, it defies the way you're supposed to watch drama. They do not suspend disbelief for one second. Instead, they construct elaborate fantasies, not about the characters, but about the actors who play the characters. It's  a real vulnerability to all the characters, and even  people that you don't  on the show. ,  the Christiannings characters  this horrible actor and that character, she's  a horrible actor, but if you're a horrible actor, it's pretty cool. You can really  it. attached to them because you feel   you could just see her going off stage and going, oh my god we're going. Oh you did really well today. Cause you could just  this is a life. What the matter? Girls, admitted it. I'm not talking to you. Come, come, come by, why are you? Yeah. You're a shame I'm not a hideous lady. I'm just a kid. I mean I did. There's a lot of that, there's a lot of that, but putting things together at the last minute. , putting your heart into something, even though it's not very good, because it really does. I've worked at room for bad projects. You worked as hard as that project. You want to be common. I have. So, I have the question, if I'm going to get my life. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. So, I'm not going to do this. John's favorite actress is Grace and Hall, plays mod that joy in him and who in explained Andrew's a lot of scenes sniffing the air, see through some bad odor. It's never discussed or explained. I have this hole I even I know nothing about I know absolutely nothing about this way from this practice except for what she does but it's full sense of what she does after the show. I have this whole world that I built up around her because what is she doing after the show? Well, I just think she likes it's an abarid dream, some smoke cigarettes. , she's just  one of these people. I'm ... I'm ... I'm ... I'm ... I've worked at Kurt's bottom and I've been with the app driver because... Yeah, she's got the most incredible facial expression of any app yours  others. I don't think I've ever seen anybody face fast. to be one of the first. I mean, she should have been  a huge star. She's the one. Well, that's it. So we're doing the second episode. I realized that not only are these stories concluded in part of the follow, they're incredible. Born in a way that invites speculation and glory to be by the audience. For instance, you are able to part of the year's performance by this song in a specific story. Guy loves the mini source jumping in saving so why is he a thing part? That says you love carnivorous and they just casually mention how he likes her Get his blood It's  you're supposed to just look  a wolf. Oh that's all that carnivorous, right? Yeah, you saw Does anybody go in the village with some water? takes a day. Pretty soon after this John the Christ has dark shadows blue blue trees real, we're finally accessing the show. Spencer next power, searching Monday, 50, that will take us for it. Popping in one of the spirit video, if another one can issue a video that he made of back in the clouds and seeing it in dark blue to a serious sun. He never finds a certain point in my realize the entire experience of his and both dark shadows. Now, slow moving, pull-up accidents completed, really fun fun. Thanks for watching, post your videos channel, talk about the most videos we've been on. The John X points explained in the first touch show, it's the Bench and the Onth for two. Strange choices, how a TV should, when some big scene works, it's not so soon. You may actually think about John and the R, the X files. What any means about? Good, here's what I'm gonna do. I love the lab. I know what the last line, dirt show, it was. I think they were going to go back to the other rare wolf plot lives that they got canceled. The last line is the varrtsod are such insurers, neck, where the scuffer to be just an apple. And not anything you have to do with the supernope. And I was talking to this guy and he was  completely into dark shadows. See, I told you the story about when human is brother-stitch. StarChaner's religious is the last show. You really say the line. It's happy. We're out. We're short credits. And the announcer comes out and says, Next one day at this time, stay tuned for password with Alan Lutton. And he said his brother, screamed at the screen. You bastard! You bastard! In a certain sense, things are scary. Have a lot of time. It's a fun. Okay. They both lose the school ranch. And be, if something that is supposed to be scary, fails to be scary, it's wein more funny than something it's trying to be funny. If that makes sense. So there's that saying, but this is how it will just be said. Let's return and pack some prayer of her. Nothing. That much shadows has anything to do. things that are scary. Cool, sweet, or hollow me. Thank you, care less about that. So what do you think about how we... For how long is my birthday, so I don't  this stuff. That's that, here's your... What am I gonna do on Halloween? I don't know quite less maybe. I painted a pumpkin so far, but it's my favorite. Finally, John. Hey, it's Halloween. This is Dave and you're expecting to be here. If you don't want to hear it's made out of monkeys, even another light on theAd Game Article. And I guess  in the forties they outwatted is they were killing one. To make his boat and they're beautiful boats and they're so beautiful. And they're ... ... Back to the forties. And you can't do a home job. This one truly spooky spring. This one we have to do. It's built from well. But of course, keeping with our pledge that everything that is supposed to be scary about Halloween will be rendered harmless during our program today. What we are bringing you is a spooky story that happens to somebody who is completely unaffraid, totally unaffraid, could care less. Homemade Carol S. on the day into the whole house, Massachusetts in the 1970s, and in the story you can hear her and her daughter describe what happened. At first they noticed these hatches of them. Weeve. air, notice he's in heat rising above. And there are sounds, people walking, stuff chattering when there was nobody. Once Carol was walking to Tharn and suddenly she says there was just a wall in front of her just this force, this force, locking her way and she said she went and she said she went and she didn't anybody bow down. And a few days later her daughter ran into the kitchen and said she was walking and an invisible wall blocked her way. Carol Esler. was professional scientists and should try to find other explanations for what's happening as it goes. But the data, I'll start at the point one. One night, I was lying in my bed. And I was just about ready to fall asleep. And the strangest thing was that I suddenly thought my body started to be. It was , you could imagine your body was magnetic, and someone was taking a magnet for removing its loveless. around your body, and it's pulling kind of a broad gentle way one way in that the other. Really felt  my body was being pulled outside and I'm the scientist so I watched and I watched and I got right a week and I watched that for almost two hours. My body was sort of pulled one way, pulled the other way, really very strange feeling. I was getting really really tired somehow that pulling was just making me so tired so I thought I'd try and experiment and I said out loud look on really really tired will you please stop and stop and I don't know that I really talked to you think I don't really know what was there and it's just a very strange experience But still, we kept trying to find other explanations. For me, I stopped trying to find other explanations when one night I woke up and I was surprised and I was looked across the room and there was a woman standing here. And she was just standing, she was looking around at things that she worked looking at me. She wasn't looking at anything that seemed to be in the room. She seemed to be looking far off and then she. she turned to see walked out of the room, right through the closed door. I thought about that, while I had a while. I think I pretty much accept now that I live in a house with her. Our ghosts left over pieces of the people who don't really see me because the woman did seem to see me or anything in the room. Sometimes. I can see them. Sometimes they can move things that move me ways that I can see or see. Sometimes they can make voices. They certainly don't seem to be. Trying the bothers. It's a good thing that even they experience us, it's good because we probably looked visible to them why she couldn't see me. It's a very interesting house, go ahead. cage Everyone I haven't mentioned yet is the crying baby. I have not experienced the crying baby, although it is she is said to spend a lot of time in my room. The first time someone experienced it, there was sleeping in the snow room off of my and it was a guest and there were no children in the house that night and the next morning he said, there was the child crying on my daughter child. crying all night long. There's no foundation on that part of the property which is supposed to have did it back in the house. In revolutionary times or earlier which had burnt here and who was  burnt in it was a woman in a child. Certainly I am training to look at, come through generations of scientists and ghosts just don't fit. But if you're a real scientist into research, and one of the most basic parts of you is the principle that everything  is wrong. Every theory, every lot of somehow breaks down. It doesn't matter whether it's quite an mechanic, nuclear physics or superconductivity. In some way or other the model is incomplete, and some way or other the model is wrong. In the way you learn in science, is to keep pushing your models until you find out where they're on. I think living here in this house, I've got some new models, I hate myself. I'll be with you always. Ever, forever. Well, this song is Barnabas Collins himself, the friendly father we tamed hired. It's played by Jonathan Thread, from the Dark Shadows album. With my love beside you. You won't be lonely. Little me to get into it. So, this today. Back three, damn her girl. My character is Lady Cassandra and Lady Cassandra's vampire. Lady Cassandra is basically walking talking sex. It's not just the fear is close to laughter. It's also close to sex. Sean the Kennedy plays Lady. Sandra at haunted bird-run manner is huge annual haunted house and more in throughout Texas about 30 miles outside Dallas. Carol Essler, the woman who lives in haunted house, shown as also a scientist, found a new model for working at the world. And , Sonic Kennedy was always sort of shy. She didn't  scary movies, she didn't my car novels, she'd never been to a haunted house last year, and last year she made a big tunnel. Now, every night, she goes out to haunted bird-run manner, too. Rome, the grounds, looking for victims and we basically try to physically and psychologically torment people waiting in line to get into the house. how? Oh, we stalk them. We will look at the crowd and try to pick the one most likely to give a good beer reaction. And we try to get that person's attention from a good distance. And then very, very slowly. Reef up on. on them, maintaining eye contact and never breaking the stair. And this is usually enough to give us a good screen or squeal or at least a break and run out of line. And were you shooting for a shooting for break and run? That's always good. It's very entertaining for everyone else in the line. A screen is also good. You  a good screen. What do you wear? I wear a skin type. Black velvet dress with a slit almost all the way up one leg. What do you say to men with? Welcome. I don't say anything. You don't talk at all. I talk as little as possible. I come. Because people in power don't need to say a lot. So if you say as little as possible, it gives people the impression that you are more powerful than they might necessarily. I'm not a real. That is just a pretty few word. Not a word. Oh, I'm a science geek. I worked in a laboratory. I played with the N.A. I'm just a happy being in the back corner of the lab by myself doing whatever. Boyd driver, you're dead with that. What do you win? Jeans on a sweatshirt. At night, my clothing will get more clean, buoyants. So I'm a belly dance. So my costume is going to be fun on it. What are you  scaring? It's an amazing feeling of power. To know that here you are somebody that generally in my deep girl uniform in my glasses and my hair pull back in a little top nod. I wouldn't make anybody twice that. But it... is Sandra, not only is they looking twice at me, but some of them are actually running from me. And I  that, that's fine. This is because I'm not sure how exactly to ask, but I want to ask her, I'm sure something that you might have thought about in your costume. What is the connection between sex and the sexual response and the fear of response in human beings is similar increased heart rate and respiratory rate. See now your sound looks  the science. Similarities in the way your body responds to both peer and sex. Also some of the images that we have in Western culture of things that are horrific are also based on the sex. what? The where we're supposed to be so that and basically vampirism is just sex in the neck up. , here, here. penetrating a past person. It's really a very sexual sort of monster. So when you're wondering the grand scheme, though I could just one intense little sketch there. Absolutely. Compare the of her sexuality to Sandra to sexuality to her audience. The sexuality of Sandra is dark. She always will have the underlying element of I could have sex. or I can tune. With belly dancing, it is a joyful thing. It is, this is my body and this is how it moves. And isn't it great with it moves this way? Aren't you enjoying this? But the English sexual experience is in terms of time to form. Absolutely, then. Absolutely. That's incredible. Absolutely, then. Shana says that she hated scares them. Two years ago, when she read this Stephen King book, Ancestum Cobb, which makes the case that everybody needs good scare in her man. And that all cultures have some version, ghost stories to do this. And reading that, et cetera, on this path, that eventually led to her pying lady Cassandra. And she says that pying lady Cassandra that she thinks would have happened. have been anyway for a dope life. I've learned it to be more certain. She's also given her more complicated future for self. She haven't just killed. I saw myself before as being a good bat to scroll, a complete creature of goodness who was going to be tormented by the powers of darkness. Afterwards, I see myself as a creature of both light and dark. I have both elements in the and I sort of got the idea that I really wasn't in. had a help for it for having a dark side. It was no longer threatening to me. And this brings us to our next story. This is story of another Texas girl discovering from dark side. We have arrived at three of our program, the evil with them. And we are pleased to go back to this very light, right at Jewish law. I was raised at Baptist, a Southern Baptist in West Texas, so I always knew that I was a center. But it wasn't until Halloween. day is fourth grade that I thought of myself as a sinful being. Before that, sin was something that could be overcome to hard work, prayer, reading the Bible, and thinking of a way out of coveting Tommy Sibele's madame Alexander Tome. Afterwards, I knew sin was part of me, and every molecule of my body, and I could never house my son? I was very excited about going to school on Halloween day. Mother had decided I could look  Daisy Mayoke on Little Abyss wife and funny papers. She cut off and fringeed a pair of old jeans. She found a pesque blouse which we ripped and pinned together with the diaper. She put my hair in pig tails and painted freckles on her nose. When she finished, she said, you look so cute, let's take a picture to send to your daddy. Daddy lived it. miles away in Amarillo. He visited pretty often now and he and mother wrote letters. I smiled my best smile to the picture, a smile that showed Daddy what a good pretty girl I was in making what a come home to say. The next day I went to school, bear ligand, bear putted, bear shoulder. Knowing that about half my friends would have ripped up one of their father's old dress shirts and come as bombs, and the other half would have dug out old cowboy guns and cowboy heads and called that across. I thought I had a chance to prize. I imagined by teachers reaction. Janice, you're just the cutest thing she's. And so clever. Maybe she'd hug the she did sometimes. Mrs. Wells was the first teacher I idolized. She was young and gritty, sweet and vivacious. She dressed in pastels, smell  cotton candy. She had just married and her husband was a part-time football coach and part-time Baptist Minister. For a while I wished my mother would die and she had stopped me, but I realized that was a sinful God. So I wished there was some kind of big sister organization. She'd be my big sister and maybe my mother would decide I should live with her because she lived closer to sure she was something. On Halloween, I stopped just inside the classroom door waiting for her to see me. haga excited reaction. When she turned her mouth dropped open. Janice Ray Hopewell, what are you thinking of? That outfit is in decent, it's obscene. You look  a little temptress. Why, you're practically naked? Attemptress? Naked? I didn't know I was naked. Then I thought of Adam and Eve in the dark, the dark arts of Eve. And how they didn't know they were naked. I looked down at my seat and landed. the legs, the sawd of his feet, legs, a naked temp face. While Mrs. Wells talked to me, she pulled Ernesto Rodriguez's chair to the back. Janice sit down at the corner. No, not at your desk. It's right from any one walking right to see. Sit in the back here. Patsy, get the blanket out of the closet. She can cover herself with that. Leon, go get the principal. Tell him it's an emergency. Cover up Janice. Your car's simple cars. I wrapped the blanket around my son. I remembered asking my son to use a small tangerine. How could it have been all bad for Adam and Eve to eat the apples? Since they got knowledge of good and evil, not just evil. And she said, they really just got knowledge of evil. Everything had been good up to me. I pulled my feet up. The principal came in Leon Anderson, right by the name of the name. What is it Mrs. Wells? Is one of the children heard? Mrs. Wells blushed. I guess it's not really an urge to see. I just felt we had to do something right away. Janice, show him your costume. I couldn't believe it. She'd said I was naked and now she wanted me to show the principal in whole class. Janice? right, take that blanket off. I stood up and put the blanket on the chair behind. I looked at the floor. After a minute, the principal said, well, there is a requirement that children wear shoes to school for health reasons. But if she stays out the playground, I don't think anything will happen in just one day. Janice, you tell your mother that you're costume next to your guests who choose. This is well-scrapped as arm. Can I talk? she went home. I could see them talking outside the door as I'd been blanked back around me. At first the principal looked  something to spunny, but Mrs. Wells did calm down. Then he looked mad into the rest of the talking. When Mrs. Wells came back in, she walked over to me and jerked the blank in a way. Janice gave me the blank. It seems I have a worry. Her face was red and she sounded  she was reciting a lesson. She didn't look. There's nothing inappropriate about your costume, although bare feet are extremely unhygetic, go to your regular seat. Can I keep the blanket? No, you may not keep the blanket. There's absolutely nothing wrong with your costume. In fact, I think you should stand up in front of the class, so we'll all have a chance to look at it. It will be good for all of us to see what's acceptable. So we... don't overreact here. For 15 minutes, she may be standing there while the other kids looked at me and gave over me. I thought about all the temptresses I knew about Bathsheba and Delilah, and about Salamate who danced nearly naked so they could cut off John Baptist's head. I thought of the movie ads with Carol Baker and Babydell, Jamma's sucking her thumb, all creatures were mad about. And I thought about Marilyn Monroe with her skirt blowing up, gettin' happy. And now everyone said Joe to Manjaro had divorced her predecessor. And if part of me was excited that I could be a tempress  Eve, and that she but Delilah, Salamate, Carol Baker, and Marilyn Monroe, and maybe even  the listening team. Most of Eve's were, that I was simple, causing sin and others without even knowing how or why. It was just something I was, that's something I did, read and thought. It's out of me. Daddy seeing picture on me now he made it and I knew I'd burn their pants. He wouldn't think I was a good sweet girl No one knew about the costume but everything was I got to spend the whole day at school barely where I get barefooted bare shoulders feeling totally It recent this in lunch I rushed to the bathroom, locked myself in a stall, and pulled my feet up so they're naked this way. The next time Daddy could you see this, I was embarrassed, stayed in my room. And six months later, Jimmy Riga pulled me into an alley, kissed me. I let it, even though I liked Leon Anderson. And the next day. The Ice Agee me was bringing Leon and they were talking about me. In two years later, the principal at my new school got the sixth grade girls alone in the closet and rubbed all up and down our phones. I was the only one who didn't tell her mother because he was a decant and she managed all the bad stretches and the outside stretches. Julie Shawlaw, who showed story for some period in other voices, literary journal published by the University of Illinois in Chicago. She's the author of the quick coming novel, Needlework. You do something to me You send chills, rice, honey I love you You're my spirit. Coming up, what really scares people today? Really? And your screams. It's in a minute. One of our victims. This American life, my regal has each week in our program which is a theme and better variety of writers who are on the black and that theme, the short stories, monologues, mini documentaries, whatever they can think of. And it is the Halloween edition book and theme is... things that are supposedly scary, but are not scary. We are at Act 4. And I actually got the idea to play you this next interview. , we'll make up most of that work. When a shonakenity that a text room just is an entire set, the following thing to me about her and her colleagues at haunted burda and manner. They all take a real joy in doing mean things to perfectly nice people. What's the pleasure in doing mean things perfectly nice people? You can do it. You have the power team. This picture of power. It reminded me of interviews that I've done with Chicago gang members. And in a certain way, , gang members are perfect for Halloween program. After all, what are most people really afraid of? Not God, but it's not Ghosts. Most people are scared of armed urban teenagers. , who just don't care? They just don't care. And I will make the case. I will... to this sphere. the other fears in our program, it's not totally justified. But you can touch yourself. This is an interview with the young woman who was a gang member for years, , council, and they'll counsel us. Girls and children. I was squomed in 70 or pounds. Maybe full foot and all. Okay. My mother thought I was her little angel. I graced her decent. My teachers liked me. I didn't get in very many fights in school. It was when I was out in my other neighborhood. This is where I became this big, bad, super person. And this is where I did not. I did not. Why? Because I quit. How did you get my gaming game? Me and a girl prank went into a school. Again, Joseph? school and destroy some stuff. We get right next to it. Did they tell you here's what you're going to do? Here's your mission. There's kind of see what happened was this. There was a teacher who was bothering somebody else and what we were to do is go and get a teacher. So what we just did is we were going to have a room and but we have so much memory right now. because you put gang signs in the wall, so every moment I did it. I'm the chalkboard, and the... In chalk. In chalk. Because the pen went around and we did animals break me. In chalk and we did do  a couple markers  on the walls. And I had to say we did a nice big one to let her know  we're keen from. Because he kind of threatened her and we were his threat backup. It's  lonely. I guess I got a point of silence. This girl lady, she knew really thing. And she wasn't has a meaning here because she just loves her. And she has to know, to see deserve it. Especially now that I work with you. I mean, I see that she was has to be because he deserved to be has to because he wasn't doing means. That's what I'm going to do. And yet we just We wrapped the world. I mean she was afraid for Oh, no, it's maybe years after that she was Me when in that Monday We were everything In there i think a lot of things we've had a lot of And it was then, and we were there, it wasn't , no it was  throw everything, scream, laugh about it. She's the thing I don't know, I don't know. How do even , capture it or explain it? On the radio, and that is the difference in reality, if you're in the game versus where you see it, if  it. The way that you all saw what you were doing was, is kind of fun. You guys laughed at that? It's real. It's a power shit. It's real. It's power. When you're 13 and you can watch the stream, everybody looks at you  there goes the call. So that's a powertrain. When you're on the street, some people can just walk up to some people. It's a smack of just smack the hell on that beat. But I was more , why? You said, I mean, you got something to do about that, , I would leave it and for I could get my anger, a fried monster, a micro-roged, and I'd even get some mental on the pitch of anger, , get... a nice wild flushy your face or something. And then the nice crowd is behind you saying, you get your ass hit her, , and now this thing then you get this bold kind of stance on you and then you can hit someone, , and you get all your nice anger out. But I couldn't just walk up and see that. And in the girls who you see now, in the girls who I see now, I lost. There's a last dude  that. They think they know everything and they don't need no reason because they know everything So all they need to do is go up and And once I'm  I said why just want to go there I clapped her You clapped her you just clapped you didn't even say anything to her She said go out how it's saying to me I Didn't just walk up a clock This is what I did to a clapped her in the face and I was it So Is this again? And what will you think of me in the walk? She goes and calls it. Now, I'm , we kind of see what I do. Because when I try to reach out and I try to talk, you just shiver into this because it's bad, and you'll hurt people and then listen, you did it. You both think actually. work your hands you see yeah I did it and some of them it does because they can't get past because I can say to someone but we and say to it and this is how I feel about it now and we've read it some of them they can't get past the fact that I did do it so that makes it correct maybe something around the subject did it and it's not the fact that I did it I did it and I got out that's what I want that I get out and I regret it. See, but what they're saying to you and where is even more interesting. What they're saying to you is, I'm not so bad. I'm not so bad, but what I'm doing isn't so bad. Because look, you did it, everybody does it. You're telling me that I'm bad. You're telling me the way I'm this wrong. But I know I'm a height that I'm not that wrong. So, that's right. When I was doing all this, there was nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong. I mean, so what? So, I went in there and I wrecked it last week. So, what? So, I hit somebody in the head with ear. They shouldn't have been messing with me. . So what? You're gonna just sit with whole face turns into  14-year-old. I mean you just  you  shake your head and  you're healthy. You kind of see what happens. It's  your whole personality just transforms. This way in a way is it's hard for me to talk about this because I do change. , and I start, but so what? And that don't care. We live on a Hona Beach spot in right there where they would kill people and hang them from the lightpost. They hunt people from the right. They hunt one person. And what it was was around Halloween and with it they just they  put jogging pants and fill it with newspaper and they put a hood and they put a kind of banana hanging out of it. It's a dangerous place and you can hang them from the lightpost and nobody knew. Because it looked   dummy I ain't it but it was human bad Yeah, not live anymore So that see that one that was from a little big war and that was I'm victory Yeah In death they push the screen to do his games on. No now it's just games on. They just have to have some of you for thinking. Holding up with our games. Not hands. Are you one of the people who did that? But you sound too. And it's the end of the night. People must have left. Let me tell them I was And remember seeing I remember there I remember I was Would it yourself Just the serial know it's you don't want to And what what do you think of it as any They take this kind of wonder why was there Who how they got it up there that was my whole big thing how they get is a child  those things Just get one you get it Take it up, put it in it. I'll try it. Please, cane, scam here, you might... You can use that dimension. Now we'll have to act six screams. For females they are going to distribute doctorate. of the Institute for Screen Studies, who has been collecting screens from the world. And his thesis is this. He says that we tend to think of the screen as a kind of monochromatic sort of binary unit information, someone  some leaders screens, or they don't, they express the kind of screenless, or they do not. What it says that is very simplistic, that there are hundreds of different kinds of screens, and there's meaning to the screen. So we have to define that meaning. And he invited more screens, yours, for you. collection, prison houses, and dozens of you called and left your screams on voicemail, and if what would Halloween put them in? That's me. Please enter your mailbox. Your mailbox is almost full. Oh my name is Oliver, and I'm gonna leave my queen. Oh my god. And I really thought much about screams. but it is rather hard to do. I just got up and I'm completely frustrated with a solo employee. The message will be so. Let's get to the layers on up. I work to the company that works six days a week, 12 hours a day. I'm so sick of it, but I want to scream. I heard a man called me with Chicago. I heard a little bit about his buddy and he reminded me of his friend. He reminded me of his friend. Her music I played in the band, the lyrics were all free And, , baby is really great thing This is a lot of fun to listen to So I'll give you the first verse, mom Mom call, go to school I'm going to play with you I'm going to play with you I'm going to play with you I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I haven't funny with doing these here. I'm just a little okay. Okay, there you go. I'm just a little. I think this is very interesting proposition because I think the screen is where you a lot of subtle characters and I've always liked sound, sound for some say. I don't say it's what is really interesting. And When I was growing up, I was allowed to scream. I was very quiet, good child, good scream at all. Publicity. Really unusual. So, here it goes. TRISB! Hi. I'mHere. I'mTheASIS2Mang When I go on all of them. Hello, cosster. I think so. I think so. Bring one. I think I can do it on the side. So I'll just bring up. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. Hello, how was listening to the radio the other night? And I heard about the green line. I just thought I'd kind of leave a little story on how I scream in where I do my scream. Right now I'm calling you from a car phone. I work in Sacramento, California. I live in the campus of Calpearia. And I make a drive of 100 in nine miles. I'm not here. Yeah, I'm here. at least three times a week back and forth. And so I'm dealing now with customers, have my job, and I also have to deal with the other participants as it's due. And so what I do is when I'm in the car, and I reach fast, well, it's fast. This point is to drive, I guess, about 75 miles I always, So, they had all my younger friends and anxieties, and everything else with a good old tree. I really didn't know it was anybody else did it.

And the way A are, , ready to talk to the way with some small. between that field  this would be appropriate screen. I wish I could be so good to screen when I was moving about in California . I could see my screen and just do it. It was great. I was able to hold in our way to do a personal talk to release a lot of things. So I was holding in it. That's all I want to say you'll come back another time. You're so sweet. You're so nice. I'm a town of dreams. One, two, three.
