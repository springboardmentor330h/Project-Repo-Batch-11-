  "text": "There's a scene in the book I wrote about a boy in the corner. This situation in the scene is this. There's this very well-maning guy who's decided that a good way to meet women would be to join a group for single parents. He's not a single parent himself. There's no children long. But there's guy whose name is Will. Goes to a meeting and gets caught up. Conversations find himself making a boss sort of things. That his non-existent child, non-existent ex-w. his heart bond with him, named Susie, and meaning. She's nerve-wracking, beautiful, they chat. They make plans to meet at a picnic, kids and parents, and comes a day off. Will cause Susie to tell her that his son, Ned, will not be there. A Ned will not be there because Ned does not exist. But will tell Susie that Ned won't be there because his mom is taking him for the day. Wait a minute. Susie tells Will that Will needs to stand up to his non-existent XYful little more farmland And then there's this passage which I'm gonna real It was much more confusing than Will had imagined making people up and he was beginning to realize that he hadn't thought it through proper way at all How could he carry it through how many times could net reasonably do we still way by his mother on maternal grandmother or international terrorists What reasons could it get for net inviting Susie round to his father? But whether or not toys or cribs or diapers or balls, whether there is no second bedroom of them, to be killed net off, the some awful disease, a car crash, tragic, tragic life goes on, maybe not. Parents got pretty cut up and back to its dying, to be fine the requisite years of grief, a real drain is test me in resources. This after was approaching, and there was nothing you can do about it. Best pull-up now. Walk away. The walking away wasn't real style. ? felt something you turned up. Even though nothing ever did, really could have lost the time. Once, years ago, he used a kid. He told a school friend, having first passenger team this friend was not a CS-List fan. It was possible to walk through the back of his wardrobe into a different world and invited him around to a schooler. Could it cancel? Could it tell him anything? It was not prepared to suffer a moment's mild embarrassment. There was no immediate need to do so. And so, the two of them scrapled around among the coat hangers for several minutes. I told Wilmumbles something about the world being closed on Saturday afternoon. I think it was. You can still remember feeling genuinely hopeful. But for the last minute, maybe there will be something we thought. Maybe I won't. The space. There wasn't. Any dead. Wodes of it. A whole head full of space. But he hadn't learned to think in the experience. If anything, it seemed to have left him with the ceiling. It was bound to be what. next time. As this scene makes clear there are different kinds of deception and the line between deceiving others and deceiving yourself can get kind of hazy especially when hope comes in blood. Today on our program the three kinds of deception, these were climbing that they're all in three for the purposes of this video. So the three kinds of deception and how any one of them. So easily turns into anyone of the others. At one of our program, self-deception, the story of an ex-con who not only told himself a lot of things that were untrue, he created a suit of web of unreality around himself, so the dozens of people in a small town started kidding themselves about what was real and it's not real. And then all of them together decided to make a feature film. 2. Disceiving others. And African American warrior enough. Hansi Manhattan firm decides that he wants to see what life is  in the exclusive country clubs that his colleagues go to So he enters one the only way that they would let a black man  him in Actory accidental deception American tourists and Paris accidentally mistake right or David Sedaris for a French he pocket First it makes a man and then he starts kind of  it From WVZ Chicago and public radio and international, it's American life, I'm a red glass, stay with us. Heck one, self deception. It's a truism that a great salesman has to actually believe the lies he tells to make the sale. The great actor has to leave him his own part. His next story is about somebody who aspires to be a great actor, but in fact, he's probably just a great salesman, a timer, neodeschool. Helks Bloomberg has to... story of how he convinced an entire town of a bunch of things that on deeper examination, one more hope and truth. Of all the tall tales Richard Castellano told the most incredible one was the easiest to actually verify. He had been from Robert the Neuron who had been called Annel as this. He had a total of 16 lines, almost all of them were one of two sentences long. It's not  this. This is the story of the power that 16 little lines  that can happen. How the 16 lines can be piloted in money and excitement and hope for lots of people. And it starts shortly after Richard Kesta went off the filming analyst's and moved with his wife to a tiny community in upstate New York with his one main street called New York. One block long and one bridge across the Delaware River, Pennsylvania. It's called Narrasburg. And with a population in the hundreds, it's literally a hammer. There's no population requirement to be a hammer, but if it were bigger than that it would be a village. We don't have a village. have a village because it's not enough people. Dick Krandell is the supervisor of New York. Supervisors what you call a mayor, comes to small to have mirrors. New York members, when Castelano, Richie as he came to be come on, first move to town. In fact, everyone here has a story. He's kind of a flamboyant person. I'll be absolutely. He wore his dark clothes from New York City and leather jacket open and he washed buckle down the street a little bit and Howard did. talk to everybody in the, , sort of a counter in hero type person. He was larger than life. He absolutely was. He would walk into what was then the chatterbox cafe and say that he was buying everybody's breakfast. And he would walk in and say hi, I'm Richard Castellano and I'm buying breakfast and then he would walk out. He liked the science stuff and every time I saw it, seeing him just gives me the science stuff himself. Pictures of himself. He loved the science stuff. He signed them. First time to his office he's. He had me run over to the restaurant to get him a couple of coffee and he wrote down  what he wanted in the coffee and signed that He started talking about his checkered background. He didn't hide it People really liked that story He was kind of a man and he's living at the nail office He told people that the name of NARSburg was going to be changed to Castleanoville He said he, he said he, he said, a, I'm a car and he got sent up to, , add again. He said he said it to many people that he had a million, two million dollars to ask the way. I, yeah, I mean he told me he killed somebody. That was about the extent of my impression of him. I just always got killed but there and do what you want others to do here. I once read my last key and gave them that what they would make, I protected them with that ответ. They always should have purchased that opportunity to try it. happy because my name is Dick. It isn't easy to get into the original pest lawn. My first instructions were to call, let it ring once, hang up, and call back against it. When we finally do meet, it's in Manhattan and his lawyers office with his lawyer there. Castellano's in his 50s, but good looking at how we slam low grass and expensive blacks and grays. Good haircut. He understands why everyone is so excited. , I've made a selection myself and I still get that was that was just explained by people I've moved in. And I remember when I was a kid I saw the three students that made a personal appearance. The A-Bot there, the book, I should ask. How did you feel when you remember? I was still talking about it, but it was so perfect. So I want to give that a chance. Say, have a little Hollywood. In the beginning, everyone seemed happy to have a little Hollywood. The town got a charming celebrity with bad boy appeal. This celebrity got an adoring cover. Richie opened an acting studio, a Richard Castellano school of acting, and 42 people signed up for his classes. He and his wife also organized the ambitiously name, first annual nearest bird international entertainment commercial credits, an incredible club. He said, Nerasburg would soon become the Sundance of the East. But most exciting, he planned to shoot a movie in Nerasburg, against a rich himself, was believed people from the town with the upper cast. 17-year-old Zack Pan here was one of the ones who stood up at the audition. Well, everybody, all the kids in the town, everybody that wanted to be an actor, everybody I knew was there, probably. And he had people come up and... improv seems  he told you what to say. I remember the scene that he had most people do was this kid Dominic was yelling and his sister about how he didn't  his father anymore because he felt  his father killed his mother. So when I was a little nervous when I came up and he said  action or whatever he said and I just  went totally off on this one girl. I was  how dare you talk about her father? that she's dead. And if it wasn't for our father, then she still be alive. And what about me? What do you think about me? You have nobody. , that. So after was up in the juice? Did you get pretty confident that? , yeah, he told me I did a good job. Yeah, he put a star by my name. And yeah, that was a good. I was , oh, star, that's good sign. I'm going to go. And so. So I don't know, I remember that we didn't have call waiting then, so I was , oh, stay up phone, no one can't talk in the phone. three weeks after that, I talked in the phone  very little. Eventually Zach got the heart. The movie was called, or Deadby Bees, shooting became in the spring 99. It was the real deal. Attack Unicon sect that the movie is alive but in some place it was the story of fate, what we played together and where we found it. Now that you are running, please watch it. Alright I did to shoot the city with Maxim, too. We did not shoot the city, thank you for being here because I really heard you can buy you I hope you have changed to do whatever you want. I hope you have, you have changed. Let's see, take a photo of Kevin for today, I love you a nice, on the same street. People pushing cameras to cut and action, guys invest solid and walky pockets. Larrily, the director of the talk, is a 30 year veteran that will provide 100 robot phones. He did how he had pubs during the silent, better-mast too. He says, typically, he can shoot a movie in 10 days. Formula always includes either a little TNA or a little violence. This is an up-to-test or, this is, this is low budget commercial. Almost immediately, things started going wrong. Castalana was constantly missing from the set, then at the first week, the checks he gave crew of bounce. Stories with headlines , hey, Castalana, where's my money? Started appearing in the local paper. And all sorts of secrets about him being played. His name wasn't Castalana,  the former crime boss, was distalled up. He'd never murdered anyone. In the armored car he claimed to have robbed, turned out to be... be a shoe store. It was all playing out, a very old and very familiar story. Charismatic plump-flump comes to town, raises people's hopes, rips them off, and emissions. The only it was so simple, it was a director for photography, and it was only rich of work capable of becoming that . Well, I think that would be giving too much credit to to him, because I don't think he's capable of that kind of thinking here. I think he was thinking, you've got some helmets, I've got some swords, I've got a knife, a garage, and we'll put on a plate. And he's going to believe it too because it's happening. People are involved, so I'll go in forward. I'll have some money shows up, maybe we can pay everybody. And he's playing out his role as this local superstar. 17 year old Zack tells this story. Well into the film, long for the script was done on parts were cast, which he was still sending people to net the set, saying they could get a part in his movie. They would have it all the time, every time the town coordinator came outside onto the porch, there would be more people there , are you the town coordinator? We're looking for the town coordinator, Richie said that we had a big part in his movie in the scene by the pooh on the guy was supposed to be in it. I don't want to be  no you're not you're not that guy. I'm sorry. Richie was mistake So they were all standard. I oh I have your autograph So I felt I felt really bad for all these people that Richie just He didn't get it through his head that  for that time From when they left where they where he was and drove to where the movie said they thought he was  the best guy in the world He wasn't the person that said that they weren't gonna be where So, you made it look  a really good guy. Really nice to meet you. You  people that think he was a really good guy. Richie had misled people that he was. He made promises and couldn't keep. But when you talked to him, you get the sense that he'd hooked himself along with everyone else. I become what I put my head. And I become that person. That my wife was in the city. We were watching the movie, but we were sitting there and I said to my wife, you see that guy's box holder, but I was in Vietnam. That's why I used to hide, used to rames, you were never being known. I said, I said, I said, but the sound is good, all right? I find it very easy, it would be comfortable out sometimes, but not happy with the wife and the staff. During one of Richie's many appearances in court, prosecuting attorney Ashton, if he'd ever told anyone he committed murder. He said, yes he had. The attorney then asked, if this was true, and he said no. He explained, I lived the roles I'd play in my movies. The final straw came in August of 2000. For months, advertisements had enough. that four deadly reasons would premiere during the second annual nearest Berg film festival. Zack Pontea rented a suit, especially for the occasion, set up a video camera in the back of the theater to capture the whole event. Here's what he recorded. Joe Dinky, the screenwriter on the phone, he met in front of the curtain, sat on the edge of the stage, then he got his legs over the side, and moving back on one elbow, the microphone in the freehand, delivered this news. Every day's your hand, you remember when those summers were being distinct? Hiya! We wrote this screenplay for the other reasons from an original story by Richard Sotton and another person. We took it and we made it through a very bi-already cell-boiled or fun map. So let's all applaud here for the first thing. Now we don't have the whole cell. here today. I really do apologize. But what you will see is 15 minutes sorry of the film that shows exactly what we're doing and how much fun it is how great your area looks and all the people that we're in this film. So I want to believe in a point and keep up because you guys are great I think it's a fun film and I know it's gonna go places and I'm having one of those really bad songs. What came next was a hastily produced 15-minute montage of scenes from the movie. It was  a porn film without the sex scenes. Acordialog, Moodyly Soundtrack, Brututus use of bikinis and double-antongers. And, most offensive, no scenes with people from Nairnsberg. Loris Stewart works for the local paper, so that when it ended, the audience was stunned. Just you just couldn't believe it, nobody could believe it. and then 70 for 175 people just were excused. I mean literally excuse the guy stood in front of the audience and said, okay, that's it. York excused and 175 people in disbelief, filed out of that theater. I mean at that point, any good, I don't know, any good well that folks had was really just prettier to wait. After the premiere, people in town stop treating Richie as a lovely outside character and set their sights on revenge. Suddenly everyone was suing him, a rental car company, 14 people from the film crew, half dozen of his acting students. Part of the reason they were upset has to do with the real reasons most of them got involved with Richie in the first place. And to understand those reasons, you have to visit someone  John Bord, the biggest investor in Castellano's film. He's all my proceeds from my check which I give them. Jack's $3,000 a year, 899, $5,000, $7,9999! John Borg lives in a double wide trailer on a small farm off a gravel road towards. A couple of his dressers as a handgun, laying next to an English pronunciation dictionary. Shicken's been free in Zyart, and the supplements as such was curried income by selling their eggs. There's some dispute about just how much money rich in cash will allow those job. on board. Castalano admit the borrowing around 60,000, forg says it's 154,000. Borg says that in decades of marriage, he'd never gone off to eat once. He didn't invest in the stock market, and up until in Met Castalano, hit his entire life savings in the bank. When I asked him why he loomed so much of his money, but his account is entire life savings. To a man he barely knew, he goes to his living room, picks up a video off the top of the TV, and shows it to me. I made more with him. Robert Denino and Billy Christian, which I went to buy the movie. I bought a K-Motain Hansel. Get the movie right there and I'll  that. Did it sound suspicious to you? It's an error not really. But getting no. Because he's a very great and a very sweet talk. And I believe the guy. Because that stupid fool is right there. In the end, one of the most surprising things about this story is just how little Stardust Castelano was offering people a bit rolled and so so Hollywood movie. And how far it took him? John Borg is  most people in there. He says he loaned rich in the money, because he thought it would help bring people in business to the area. But you get the sense there's something more. I asked did Richie ever offer for him? Valie said, I'm gonna see maybe gonna get you some, , what? I told him I'm not interested. But part of me was a little interested. Well, if I would be interested, I would have made a wash of Dylan. Each I got a picture right there. Part of the dog, but... At this point John Borgos and picks up a framed photograph, resting on a dolly and up at his VCR. I'm a figure with a cowboy hat and handgun. So this is it. Yeah, that's you. Yeah, and it's my go up to you got a cowboy hat is that at your house? I got my hair in the closet. This is the 31. I'm not much. It's called me to talk too much about it. But it told me if he gonna give me a God gonna be  a law enforcement office. Oh, I was a Marshall Dylan. That means he's ran up for the, . More time I spend in boardhouse, more ever. I discovered of his obsession with movies. He owns dozens of videos, big shopping bags, and on shelves, stacked on tables. Later in the conversation, fairly buckwheat in the new office story, gets up, grabs his cowboy hat, turns the brim up with silly sales, and announces that he can act if that's what he called this. I've been up there these a guy, and I should believe you were ready, but anybody's rather rich. What it calls this stupid was, and as soon as I can figure out, just remember, how to say a little bit about development. He used to entertain his co-workers doing long night shifts. He says he showed it to cast a lot of it. He said he'd put him in the show. What is all he got to do is all. I'm just going to get you a bowl of water in the room. I got shit. Not even one minute. He promised me that he could have put me in a movie. I'm going to hang out. You want to know why Paul Vitty comes to a poor Vitty come to the business father was  this father was  this, right here is  this father is  this, right here is by that corn this is Richard Castellano quoting other people's lives from the movie in which he played a bit role analyze this. In our two-hour interview in this lawyer's office who is defensive and guarded until I asked him about his favorite actors in favorite movie seats. He stood up, rubbed his hands together, got into character. Tell us, we fetched it up, why was the big seat? I was there, everybody was there, both of us, well, 60. Standing there in the conference room, cast a line of block here in the scene, positioning me a couple of feet from me. Give those good enough, okay, good enough. Go away, go away. me? Yeah, no you don't. Did you really bat me the paper? Yeah. Don't do that. She might put you in a paper? Yes. Or you didn't? I didn't even get the paper. Did you read about me? Oh yes I did. No you didn't. I didn't even get the paper. You guys were so ghostly. I asked the Lionel actor that whole stretch is a dialogue from scenes in which he didn't even appear. someone who watched the film dozens of times. It was... hard for him to pack it's the dream of Hollywood to the people of Narsburg. There's a dream he understood. Well, I know this feeling it gave me that I'd start going to see very nice so think that I feel the attitude to the world now. I mean, you read here so much about pixel-level, you got made hundreds of movies, all you talk to the world, the best act of the world, and you watch an arrived with Jake and say drinking coffee with him. I can of course walk and  just be the problem. that's the most exciting next exciting. Feeling how we get is when I be God. That'll be the closest I could get through. I always say when I play Bob's here. Everyone I spoke with in the era of work I asked the same question. If all this were made into a movie, who would you want for the part of you? And all of them said the same thing. From John board to Zach Pontear, the richy cat, the Lana. They wanted to play themselves. Out Splumberg is producing here at this American life.

But probably the international. When art program continues. This American light, my request. Each within a program of course we choose some theme and you are ready of different kinds of stories on that theme. I show today the three kinds of this section. Heck one, viewer call was about self deception. We've wrapped it up too, deceiving others. New 30 years old, a Harvard law school graduate and he practicing attorney making over $100,000 a year. Lawrence O. Discram decided to take a job as a bus boy and all white country club. Be clear, he didn't decide to do this because of his own experience these country clubs. So we've had some. Growing up on the border of Scarce in New York, there were white families all around at the country clubs. And his family, the recipe black family, Memphis, in Iraq. My very first club experience was not a very positive one. It was when I was around seven years old. My parents objected to my brother and I going to a country club with our best friend who had crossed the street. And they belonged to a club that my parents said did not permit blacks or Jews. So they brought us to the club between system 1 to the level 7 of my brother was 9. But we got into the children's swimming pool. They had a kiddie pool and a dog pool. And within less than 2 hours. three minutes for the kids down in the pool. And my brother Richard and my ran out of the pool too, because we thought there was something in the water that was going to hurt us. And we realized this was a club which is did not want us, man. The world is a world. My parents had warned me, it's something might happen. But my brother and I were growing up in what we imagined to be liberal and informed, , me you are subordinates. communities where we thought the stories of my parents told us about Memphis and the other parts of the south from the forties and 50s didn't exist anymore. I just think about your parents and their situation of how protective and sad they must have felt for you. But also at the same time they must have felt , well, , it's good that you saw it. , I felt that it was good that we saw it. They understood the environment they knew that nothing physically would happen to us. But it was an important lesson for the middle-end of our relationship. Many years later, as an adult, working at a fancy Manhattan law. Fine, set a screen. And a friend, on this. Many friends who were working in the York who were black or Latino, Jewish or female, kept sharing stories with me that in their firms they were noticing that the people that were moving up ahead in their businesses were ones who were brought to country clubs over the weekend. And... And I started to notice that there was a pattern that none of us, none of the blacks, none of the Jews, none of the women, none of the Latinos or Asians were being brought. Again, to be clear about his motivations, he wanted to be part of that. Wanted access to those connections. And he was curious about what exactly went on at his specific clubsy. And that's why he decided to get in the only way that he could, as a bus boy. Two weeks, he left his high page up. at the last time, and went undercover, essentially a black man impersonating black man. He chose the oldest, most prestigious club he could get to, hundred year old, Greenwich Country Club, the Trishin White Greenwich Connecticut. He could have to be hard work, physically demanding, and he wrote up this account of his experience. March 28, April 7, 1992. I invented a completely new resume for myself. I raised Harvard, Princeton, and my upper middle class suburban childhood. from my life. I pieced together a wardrobe with a polyester blazer, iron blue slacks, black loafers, and a horrendous pink black and silver tie, and I set up injuries at clubs. Over the telephone, five of the eight said that I sounded as if I would make a great waiter. But when they saw that I was black, the club managers told me I would quote, probably make a much better buscler. Over the phone, you said you need a waiter. I argue. Sunday April 12th. Today was my first day at work. Looking in my wallet, I removed my American Express Gold card, my Harvard Club membership ID, and all of my business cards. When I arrived at the club, my new boss waved me. Good morning, Larry, he said that this efficient in warm small. I missed a lion, how's it going? Glancing it is watched, check my punctuality, he shook my hand, handed me some tape. Oh, and by the way, where do you pot? In front, near the tennis boards. Already shaking his head, he tossed his pencil onto the desk. That's off limits to you should always park him back, enter in the back, leave him to them, no exceptions. I'll do the forms right now, I say. And then I'll be an official bus crew. Mr. Ryan, threw me an ominous and Larry, let me stop you now, we don't  that sort of bus crew. We find you. to me. We prefer to call you Bussman. Leading me down the center stairwell to the base of the added, and in the future, he will always use the back stairway by the back entrance. He showed me the mixed grill, a well lit pastel room with glass-front stores, light wood shroom. Guy, say hello to Larry, he's a new Bussman at plug. I wait. And this is Rick Steven Drew Buddy and Lee. Five white waiters dressed in white polisher to blue 1892 blood and signature, not in while this is in slicing lens. And this is Hector and Carlos, the other bus. Hector Carlos and I were the only non-writes in the surface. They greeted me in a mix of English and Spanish. Nice to meet all of you. I responded. Thank God one of the top. way or is quite out. Final, somebody who can speak English. Standing outside the ice cream, Carlos and I talked about our paths. He was 25 originally from Columbia and happened to finish school. You're going to live in the monkey house, Carlos asked, What's that? We climbed stairs to take our 10-minute lunch break before work we did. Monkey house is where workers live here. Carlos said, What's that? I was soon back downstairs working in the grill. At my first few tables I tried to avoid making eye contact with members as I removed dirty plates, white down tables and chairs. I was sure I'd be ready to. At around 15, four men who looked to be in their mid to late 50s sat down, the six chair table, while pulling off their cotton wind break as a gallswip. These damn news people have caught. all these problems said golfer number one, shoving his hand deep into a popcorn bowl. These Negroes wouldn't even be thinking about golf. They can't afford to join a club anyway. Golfer number two squirmed out of his name Bruce Wetter nodding a drink. My big problem with its Clinton fellow is that he apologised. As I stood watching from the corner of the bar, I realized the men were talking about Governor Bill Clinton to loosen the apology for playing at an all-white golf club in Mississippi. I couldn't agree with you more at a golf in a birthday. I have to demand you as fighting off the end of the cigar. You got any ice tea, golf in number one after I put the silverware in the news around the table. Popcorn. So the out of his mouth is a attempt to speak, chew at the same time. Yes, we certainly do. Golf in number three removed a beat up throwless as risk. It just set that bad press it. Instead of apologizing, he should try to discredit. Under cup and sink, what's to apologize for it? I cleared my throat back to late meditation. Suddenly, a golfer number one waved me back to the sand. Should we get four iced teas or just a pitcher and four glasses? I'd be happy to bring whatever you'd , sir. Oh, breastboy, a voice crawled out as I made the round with two cups of coffee. Here, bossboy, here, bossboy. boy the woman crawled out. Bust boy my coffee is cold. Give me a reason. Certainly I would be happy to reach over for her cup. The 50th woman pushed her hand through her straw blonde hair and turned look at me in the face. D-capped, aren't you? You are quite welcome. Before I turn toward the kitchen the woman leaned over to her comparing. Hi good, did you hear that? That bus boy has addiction  an educated white person. A curly-haired waiter walked up to me in the kitchen. Larry, are you living in the monkey house? No. But why do they call it that? Well, no offense against you, but it got that name's house for the workers that lived in the club. And since the workers used to be negroes, blacks that were mittening the monkey house. And the name just stopped, even though negroes have now been replaced by his spams. Saturday April 8th. Today while I was wiping down a table I heard a member snap the fingers in my direction. I turned to see a group of young men smoking cigars. They seem to be my age or a couple of years young. Hey do you want to know you the boys laugh? As I turn slowly to a place here on my own heartbeat, I was sure it was someone I knew. No, I said, approaching the blocks the guys smoke. I don't think so. You must be new. What's your name? My name is Larry. I just started a few days ago. The cigar smoking host grabbed me by the list while looking at his yes. Well Larry, welcome to the club. I'm Mr. Billan. This is Mr. Dennis. I'm friend. The new member. Hello Mr. Dennis. I heard myself saying to a crackle-face young man who puffed him comfortably on his fat roll with tobacco. The first cigar smoker just stood for me to bend over as if he... were about to share some important confidence. Now, Lara, who's what I want you to do? Go get us some of those demons. And then, give my guests me a fresh astray. Can you manage that? Tuesday, April 21. Just because we were all leaving for the day, Mr. Lion came down to hand up the new policies for those who are going to be living in the Mobile Services, It recently then renovated the club was replying all new residents to sign the form. The policy included a rule that forbade employees to have overnight guests. Rule 14 stayed at the club management, had the right to enter employees locked bedroom at any time without permission to without giving notes. As I was making rounds with my coffee pots, I overheard a raspy glassed woman talking to a mother and daughter who were coming to a child. of infants' clothes. The problem with opares is that usually only in the country for a year. The mother and daughter are not in agreement, but getting one that facilitates its own problem. For example, if you ever have to choose between a Negro and one of these Spanish people always go for the Negro. One of the women proud, confused, really. Yes, the raspy boys women responded to co-logic. Even though you can't trust either one. at least Negro, speak English, and can follow your direction. Before I could refill the final cup, the Rasky voice woman looked up at me and smiled. Oh, thanks for the refill, live. Wednesday, April 22. Today, the TV was turned to testimony and closing arguments from the Rodney Kim police beat and trial in California. I am so set to think that awful video take one woman. said the friend that her tail, it shouldn't be on TV. At around two, lowest the club's official secretary, after me to help her send out a mail, 600 members, after my ship. She took me up to her office and the main floor introduced me to the two women who sat with them. Larry, this is Mars, and we'll talk with him three months because she's in charge of employee benefits. I smiled at the brunette, and Larry, this is sanded, and we'll talk with him after you become a member of the club, because she's in charge. of members of camps. Both Sandy and I looked up at Lois' shocked expressions. Lois winked at the same moment, read Joville Women first out loud. Thursday April 23. At the end of the day, Mr. Ryan handed me my first picture. When I opened the envelope and saw what I'd earned, one hundred seventy four dollars, four cents, five days. I'm... laughed out loud. Back in the security of a bathroom stall, where I had periodically been taking notes and screaming arrival, I studied the check and bought about how many hours, and how hard I'd worked for so little money. It was less than one tenth of what I'd made in the same time by law firm. I went upstairs and asked Mr. Ryan about my paycheck. Well, we decided to give you $7 an hour, he said. I'd never actually been told my hourly rate. But if the check looks especially big, that's because you've got some extra pay in there for all of your terrific work and good Friday. And by the way, don't tell any of the others what you're getting because we're giving you a special deal and it's really nobody else's business. I nodded and thanked him for his large ass. I stuffed some more envelopes, emptied out my locker and lost. All right, so this is Graham. Reading from one of the essays in this book, remember the pub. He says he wasn't surprised at what he called the passive David Tree. He said, nothing to themselves has racist. Interestingly, the more pointed language came from pubs down. The routinely used the word, Nigga. It was not a reference to me, but it was in reference to them watching television. That's good news. I was telling him he was constantly on. So, , there are those knitters are again kind of thing. But, , two seconds later they returned to me and say, oh, I can become do so and so. Then it was not even, it was not. I honestly don't even believe that they thought that people were going to send it by the use of the term. When you heard this, were you surprised at all? No. Now I'll tell you why when it surprised, I wasn't surprised because of what they had put me in order to get job. I have three callback interviews from the shop. Three callback interviews for a bus for a job. Wow. I mean that is, I mean, outrageous, I mean if you look at what it would take to get a job and I'd be at. I mean, I don't think you'd have three callback jobs. So it was very clear to me that there was something about myself to make them feel uncomfortable. We call it the Greenwich Country Club. Define that if the club now. minutes, blacks or Jews or any minority members at all? The cut to coins to a song. The first day i met therible country when i was a school from the rde Hadchery & independent women You're gone from home, and no more and no less. Katherine Exitinal Disception Okay to review this far in our program we have witnessed self-deception the willful deception of others and how one of those can lead to the other David Sidaris is right at living these days in Paris France with his boyfriend Hugh now has this story of accidental deception Now it can send somebody down the slippery slope to both It was July and you and I were taking the Paris Metro from our neighborhood to a store where we helped to buy a good deal of furlap During the summer months, a great number of American vacationers can be found riding the metro, and their voices tend to carry. It's something I hadn't noticed until leaving home, but we are allowed people. On the first of our two trains, I listened to a quartet of college-aged Texans, who sat beneath a sign instructing passengers to surrender their seats, and stand should the foyer of the train become too crowded. And while the other stood to make more room. The young Texans remain seated and raised their voices in order to continue their debate, the topic being, which is a better city, Houston or Paris. It was a hot afternoon and the subject of air conditioning came in the play. Houston had it, dressed it not. Houston also had ice cubes, tacos, plenty of free parking. It's something called a sonic burger. Things were not looking good for Paris. Which lost valuable points every time the train stopped, except more passengers. The crowds packed in surrounding the seated taxes and reducing them to four disembodied voices. From the far corner of the car, one of them shouted that they were tired and dirty and ready to catch the next plainhold. The voice was weary and hopeless, and I identified completely. C'mon steps up. It was the same way I felt on my last visit to Houston. He went I disembark to the screens of Texas, our Texas, and boarded our second train were in American couple in their late 40s stood hugging the floor to ceiling support pole. There's no sign saying so, but such poles are not considered private. They're put there for everyone's use. You don't treat it  a fireman's pole. Whether you grasp it with one hand and stand back and it was respectable. distance. It's not all that difficult to figure out, even if you come from a town without any public transportation. The train left the station and needing something to hold on to, I wedged my hand between the American couple and grabbed a pole at waste level. The man then turned to the woman saying, P.U. can you smell that? That is pure French, baby. Here we move to one of his hands from the... and waved it back and forth in front of his face. Yes indeed he said, this little froggy is right. A joke a moment to realize he was talking about me. The woman wrinkled her nose, Gally, Pete, she said, did they all smell this band? It's pretty jippable, the man said. I'm willing to bet that our little friend here hasn't had a bath in a good two week. I mean, Jesus Christ, someone should hang at the odor eyes who are around this guy's neck. The woman laughs, saying, you crack me up, Martin, I swear you do. It's a common mistake for vacationing Americans to assume that everyone around them is French and therefore speaks no English whatsoever. An experienced traveler could have told by looking at my shoes that I was French. Even if I were French, it's not as if. English is some mysterious tribal dialect. Spoken only by anthropologists and a small population of cannibals. Because I had used the tires and words froggy and complained about my odor, I was now licensed to hate this couple as much as I wanted. This made me happy as I wanted to hate them from the moment I entered the sub- part. Now, free to criticize Martin's clothing. The pleaded denim shorts, the baseball cap, the t-shirt advertising a San Diego pizza restaurant. Glasses hung from his neck on a fluorescent cable, and the couple's bright new his and hers sneakers suggested that they might be headed somewhere dressy for dinner. Come for it as it's place, but it seems rude to visit another country dressed as if you've come to Moett's lawns. People are often frightened of parrots, but an American in Paris will find no harsher critic than another American. Francis and even my country, but there I was, deciding that these people needed to be set back home, preferably in chains. In disliking them I was forced to recognize my own pretension, and that made me hate them even more. a curve and when I move my hand further up the pole, the man turned to the woman saying, Carol, hey, Carol, watch out that guy's going after your wallet. What? Your wallet, Martin said, that Joker's trying to steal your wallet. Move your pocket, look to the front where he can't get at it. She froze and he repeated himself barking. The front, move your pocket, look around to the front. Do it now, the guys pick pocket. The woman named Carol, grabbed for the strap. shoulder and moved her pocket book so that it now rests at a corner stomach. Wow, she said. I sure didn't see that coming. Well, you've never been to Paris before, but let that be a lesson to you. Martin glared at me, his eyes narrowed his lips. This city is full of stingpots  our little friend here. Let your guard down and they'll take you for everything you've got. Now I was a stingpot and a thief. I'd occurred to me to say something, but I thought it might be better to wait and see what he came up with next. Besides, if I said something at this point, he probably would have apologized, and I wasn't interested in that. As embarrassment would have pleased me, but once he recovered, they would be that awkward period that sometimes culminates in a handshake. I didn't want to touch these people's hands or see things from their point of view. I just wanted to continue hating them. So I kept my mouth shut and stared off. off in the space. The train stopped at the next station. Passengers got off in Carole and Martin moved to occupied two folding seats located beside the door. I thought they might ease on to another topic, but Martin was on a roll now and there was no stopping him. It was some shit had  him that stole my wallet on my last trip to Paris, he said, nodding his head in my direction. He got me on the subway, came up from behind and I never felt cash, credit cards, drivers license, food. all of it gone, just  that. I picture the scoreboard reading Part E0, Sting Pots 1. Would you have gone to understand as if these creeps are practiced professionals? I mean, they've really got it down to an art if you can call that an art form. I wouldn't call it an art form, Carol said. Art is beautiful, but taking people's wallets, that stinks in my opinion. You've got that right, Mark said. The thing is, these jokers usually... in pairs. He squinted toward the opposite end of the car. Odds are that he's probably got a partner somewhere on this subway car. He thinks so, I know so, he said. They usually time it so that one of them puts you wallet just as a train pulls into the station. The other guy's job is to run in her parents, trip you up once he catch wind, what's going on. Then the train stops the doors open and they disappear to the crowd. If stinky there got in his way. He probably be half way to Timber. I mean, make no mistake these guys are fast. I'm not the sort of person one will mistake for being fast and well coordinated. And because of this, I found Martin's assumptions to be oddly flattering. I just get my goat, he said. I mean, where's a police he only when you need one? Police he only? Where did he think he was? I'm not a FUCKING I tried to imagine Martin's conversation with the French policeman and pictured him waiting as arms shouting, that man tried to pick up my friend's pocket money. I wanted very much to hear such a conversation. And so I decided I would take the wallet from Hughes back pocket as we left the train. Martin would watch me steal from a supposed stranger and would most... likely in her seat. He put me in a headlocker, yell for help. And when a crowd gathered, I'd say, what's the problem? Is it against a lot of our money from my own boyfriend? If the police came, he would explain the situation in his perfect French, while I'd toss in a few of my most polished phrases. That guy's crazy, I'd say, pointing apart. I think he's drunk. Look at how his face is swollen. I was practicing these lines to myself when he came up from behind and tapped me . on the shoulder, signaling that the next stop was ours. There you go Martin said that's him, that's a partner. Didn't I tell you he was around here somewhere? They always work in pairs. It's the oldest trick in the book. He would have been reading the paper and had no idea what had been going on. There was too late now to pretend he was talking. And I was stuck with that, I did some backup plan. As we pulled into the station, I recalled an afternoon 10 years earlier. I'd been riding the Chicago L with my sister and he was getting off. two of three stops ahead of me. The door is open, and as she stepped out of the crowded car, she turned around the L. So long, David. Good luck beating that rape charge! Everyone on board had turned a stairway. Some seem curious, some seem frightened, but The overwhelming majority appeared to hate me, the porosity I had never before encountered. That's my sister, I said. She likes to joke around. I laughed and smiled, but I didn't know good. Every gesture made me appear more guilty. And I wound up getting off the next stop, rather than continuing riding alongside people who thought it was right this time. I wanted to say something not good to Mark, but I can't think as fast as I need. In the end this man might go home morning his friends to watch out for pickpots and errors. He'd be the same old Mark, but at least for the next few seconds I still have the opportunity to be somebody different, somewhat quick, dangerous. The new one danger is me, notice how Mark tight his fists with a train over the stop. Carol held your pocketbook close to get some chance to suck in her breath. as you and I stepped out of the car, no longer finicky little boyfriend on their overseas experiment, but robes a cults' half way to turn buck to.
