  "text": "Okay, here's a couple for you. First thing. I usually always say that I'm Chris first. Do you still get a church at the same? Yes, try to go on church every Sunday. I have very active in the church. I was the chairman of the package. Okay, that's him now. Oh, I'm an atheist. I only go to church and Sunday. Let's say if my daughter's performing a violin, we started out there and I just I don't really participate in the church. I just sit there. Can people who have religion? And people who don't, do we understand each other? Mary and Manford Rower have been married for 22 years. They have a teenage daughter. It is surprisingly harmonious. And then how would it work when you were present in the congregation? Is that the kind of job we're using to do is bring your family on to life. Well, a lot of people thought it was just ... Yes. People that are not directly involved in this. I've been approached. Oh my gosh. Of course whatever. I'd  to be a certain character. Mary was Catholic on the first map. I lost her faith by the time they were married. But they talked by these things so in frequent, but it wasn't until their daughter was born. Years later, that it hasn't really understood she would have no part of religion at all. Here's how they make it work. They have a system. They hit me. They do not discuss it at all. I'm not used to it. I want good marriage. Let's do a talk about it. That's why I mean if we're going to argue every time, I mean if I don't believe anything he says, where's the talk it? What are we going to talk about? I mean, it doesn't interfere in our everyday life. I mean, maybe he prays when somebody's not want to read the Bible. of the eaters so it's not really an issue except something moving . But every morning when I get up on the bike she did. You don't know the thing. I see him reading the Bible once in quiet. It's not. It doesn't seem  it's every day unless he's hiding somewhere in reading inside certain things. Where did you read? I get up for a week. There he knows let's go. in a sense this is more tragic story than after all he believes is going to happen and it leaves and when he gets there she will know she doesn't have a relationship with Jesus. He prays and waits for God to gain life. Meem up she does not want. Thanks for. She doesn't want to see the wife. And probably have to gather those part of these things. But yeah, that she just doesn't care. It's not a dialogue, it's a dialogue. It's a dialogue. I understand people want one. That's a dialogue. But I don't understand. The part I've traveled is why it's  a dream or it's an unreal world. I'm more in reality. that I may work. Is it right? First of all, I would  to say, because I find it cares with my things. God be great. I think he's in our lives again. And I feel that God has the direction of life. And who's going to get to where he may to the serve? So it kind of has a direction. So undirected. There shall I look. , it kind of direction  it directs. No, there's God rules every person. It's a good thing. Now do not be deceived by how they are arguing. In the normal eyes, we may not be in. review that the existence God, these people show all the science and couple who are remarkable happy together. Look at one way, the story is about how the secular and the richest world cannot understand each other ever. Look at another, it's a story about how well it, which brings us to today's book. From WB EZish Hago and Public Radio International, this is my friend, my friend, last. Today on our Radio Program, Christians and non-Christmas, get her again. at one of our program, Exodus, completely secular person alive, and talent with thousands of people, but taking part in a mass prayer project to save their city. Back to Kings, set a carrier talks about Carpenter's Christians, and why the two should not be around to be together. Let's do this. What about this guy? Me? Neighbor? We met him! BE grasped! Let's do this. Usually we think of prayers privately, all prayer  all politics is local. Plus people pray for those in your dear town. Sort of. The Colorado Springs, probably about a dozen elaborate programs in the way. Problem doesn't search as fast people pray. Not just for those nearby, but to try to fundamentally alter the civic life of this through prayer. The details about these are complicated. Some are  a modern, door to door marketing or canvas. Perhaps, you'd listen. statistics chart out what parts of their city need prayer for what reasons merge with something that could not be less modern prayer and when this American art producer we speak or started to investigate it it became something she could not get out of the mind she said she had color see it's only this is the tape that brought me on the school it's a sermon given by pastor Ted Hack with the new research about prayer while pastor to all visiting taking them off the city, divided into districts, assign those districts to people in this time station, and together they're walking up and down every street, praying for the people in the houses and all the shops and businesses. I love grid praying, where we walk, what you have the parallel streets and you put a person at the end of each street and then you walk up and down that street and at the end of every block you can't make sure your buttons there and make sure your buddies there. And you do another block and you make sure your buddies there and make sure your buddies there. Then you pray another block, say you pray over every home, every business, every school, everything, and you realize, , if we were doing the song these people would never be grateful. The thing about this that I find surprising is that it's not a PR fan. They don't not have a voice, they don't ask for donations. They're not kind to win the hearts and minds and not Christians by letting  how much they told them. In fact, they don't even want people being prayed for it to know that it is a start walk. the street with the great people. And with the great people are in it  that. Prayer is a private thing. We don't stand up and go, come on, Holy Spirit or anything  that. We just walk along, have baseball, have fun, jug of water or whatever mountain dude who wants to slice. And we'll be walking along and we'll just pray, father in the name of the name of the name of the city of the Santiago. The city of the Santiago. people walking, praying for people they don't know, that is the traditional one. I wanted to see if it was a sure enough time to succeed with it. I wanted to see if all the prayer was happening in the past. No other American city is working as a systemman to get that attention. And I thought sure that it got as good as getting one, not in America. It's going to speak in the process, right? I wanted to see if it was a good idea. My first surprise on a rat tree pot rata is the new life church that's less  the this worship and more  the wall can be used than any religious institution can help you see. It's a law, black, grand, place building with large side to shun have remisters to the cross. New life is what's known as a negligent. It has six members over one percent depotulation installed in the string sequлом wider. My second surprise is that while all the people are completely fine, the smile, the gracious, they always are making me talk to you,  I am very talking. I can't understand what you're saying. As we pray, we open a hole in the spiritual dynamics above the earth, in the spiritual realm of the earth. So here's Planet Earth, here. This is trash. She works in life with a population's department. She took me to lunch and... before the routine I decided to warm up with questions I didn't need to. How is prayer well? I figured you're telling me, , praying, and while piercing in the answers. The two napkins with the guidance that I realized is much more tough. So what I've known is, I just opened, I just drew an opening in this biosphere of spiritual dynamics that are going on in the heavens. And as we open this sphere, we... The alarm, the will of God, the kingdom of God, to come to Planger. Trish, , must be other Christians I mentioned on the screen, speaks of very particular language. They're constantly using phrases  spiritual tenies, standing and gap, spiritual to certain intercels, spiritual to the Joshua tenor, chewing the law in the natural, the ten-fording window. And for me, it's  being on the contrary. I come from within non-vittistutes, never had any conflict screen. And while I know some devout Christians, all of my friends belong to the Netherlands, but never goes to church ensemble. After listening to this Christian jargon for a day and a half, I realized that I'm not understanding well enough to do a decent story. So I go and visit the person in charge of setting up on the interview with all that we . Pastor Joseph Johnson. Joseph is a tall broad Nigerian, and I  him a lot. For a pastor, he's a very worldly, who is a professional soccer player, who is trained as a... next step, speaks so well which is travels by the end of the first Christian and Colorado Springs in Tomlinson. We have a regression with practice session. I tell on that because the language I'm afraid that maybe if I don't talk to Ruby understood that or appealing to a secular audience that I need someone who doesn't sound  a head and wife called him off. Then he tells me that he doesn't believe that what's going on with Christians in the city of Colorado Springs. can be understood by people outside. That in fact, the whole of the Christian spirit world is in comprehensive setting up. There is no common ground. I, of course, are actually with me. Said that people are people and ultimately we can understand one another. And we go back and forth and back and forth. He insists the religious campaign to sort about non-muggest ion cessation. And at some point, I'll get physically frustrated people to solve. This is one chance. it tells you on your side. up until this point you didn't understand that something you still, and this is what you saw it. It says you're looking for something you can't make some of this. You didn't compare to this people. You said you were something else. And that's how the point you didn't thought, on one of those people. You're looking for something you can't make some of this. Joseph refers to me, maybe, for me. We're at finally find a prayer walker who doesn't speak in Jordan. His name is Paul. His parents are more than his but he can be a charismatic question to me when he turns into a church. That's when he studied prayer walking. I go with him early when he gets to meet me and explains the most specific prayers are. The more likely it's that one to me. Versy waspile house. He looks at the lawn and the surface on him. searching for physical cues which will tell them what's going on inside. The outward appearance of the house, the lawn, the way the house is kept up and the house is, you can usually tell because they're too busy fighting with the family that they can't get in your bed and their stuff done. , , when my parents get divorced, our lawn is kind of bad. I really didn't. because I think they can really matter. I think they're  this. If the house looks  it belongs to a couple of kids, probably pray for God to be the cause of their contract. If the house looks  belongs to an old person, probably pray for God to be the cause of their decision to be and blessed with grandchildren. It's exactly what I imagined for our wife and kids. People taking time, praying that we could attend and ask you to let me return. I watch policy and I can see a really strange management just from life. He's standing on the sidewalk and one of his neighbors do his story house, besides it first and the side is a kind of mindset. Thank you so much, Kurt. Thank you, Kurt. The neighbors that you're giving me, I don't know that there's nothing better than to sit down and reach your word and to warm your knees and to create you, close credit paid to use this thing. Both of this has to be a huge amount of sleep. There's something really meant to me that way, well at least it's about to come. He walks quietly down the street, then the silence is not the last he's trying to live in. And it shoots the way that he plays back. If he asks to meet them in school or in the neighborhood gets together, he's more friendly than you are. And then to pass me in laps to the sick person, that's just about to come. However, it would be stupid. I feel as if I've already started at some kind of relationship, some kind of friendship. because, , I'll give the seed fruits of my prayer and see how, how, how, how, how much this is , if they know it or not. When I asked Paul how he knows what he's doing is changing anything. He looks at me  I just asked him how he knows the sum of how to smile. And then he asked me a question. That's great. The next day, first day, I go to visit your school in Saoan, just to talk. I find myself there to visit your school, just to talk with you. I visit and talk about your work as well. Some of this is what just, this happened in the time of the year, but a lot of this... and I'm just as well. We talk better about this and argue about this, but he thinks I'm going to have a nightmare. He thinks the only way to leave you just  this with Jesus, I don't. It always is this friendly low-level code for the book, which for some reason is to surprise both of us every time we stumble on it. At one point, we have to do pass your time and spend it on every loop. We're not talking about some evidence that doesn't prove it's a Darwinist rule. I have co-star Turkey, then there's this long sex sex. This is to me, actually realize that you're doing that in this. Which is exactly what I was thinking of in my heart. I should realize that you're doing this. I talked to Joseph with that prayer well. Tell him about Paul's prayer well. Paul's in secret of the people's prayer. Joseph accepts this moment. It's not correct. It's the duty of Jesus. At one point, it's a task. You may not realize this but that people, frankly, even here now. In this church, people that frankly, you serve it. You are coming to a relationship with Jesus the same. There's dinner that I go home from town room and walk in the street and walk outside. I can start the lab with arguments that why I don't buy I can't be comfortable. I get one hour's. Hi, hang out. Have any good day? Okay. Okay. Okay. See you. The next morning I've noticed that woman named Jennifer Phillips, who's called to pick up them. Twice a week she goes to the center of square and downtown Colorado Springs and prays for all the women living in the city on five benches. Jennifer is an art on cute, misgives and flat button bags. And I  her a lot, but in her language is so dense that the reference and I'm so tired that I just share this well. Excuse me. spiritual work there, spiritual strongholds, praying spiritual and ambition. Then she tells me that she gets nervous and she's not just because she's a woman alone walking at night or in the early morning environment. There's another disease. Demonic strongholds in this area, things that have just over centuries that we'll mind of, I mean I don't know what this land was, we're the guy, I know there's a lot of land around here where they did sacrifice. Hope. that you have to pray that out. And in a few years, it talks about being dressed in a spiritual arm. It says that Saint Rome's the earth have been through the print and the air. And he relays that he's at his earth. Up until this moment of Jennifer, I felt that there were lots of things that were she knew as well. And I'm hoping around for the next night, I'm hoping to do this. But as Jennifer talks, I realized a lot more about what you spent in Berlin. something much more than you call. She explains that scene is a living act of presence, just as God is living in presence. And that all around the Sun is through to call about the spring. There is constant and intense warfare in two. Jennifer is one of the best works and it's deep. I mean there's times where people go through warfare, through the warfare, we'll pray and the next week we'll leave their dog. There's a woman that enters the spread of the church right now. and see foster job, streams things happen that next week after week. It's a battle which means you can get hurt too. On every day, the next day, seeing what's right at the music. And now, this week gives a week. rewarding me  go through depression or  hopelessness. Open up the Paraguay in Jennifer Dilsas. There's one go out and see, or experiences in terms of death. These were treat with its deceit. She sees it as his way of thinking of the good she does. It is a stunning event in secular life. For every talk show, men's and the reasons for their abuse. to emotional and psychological relationships with feeling one more than we ever. To meet someone who has a country with a different role in interpreting the human life. Someone who believes that the reason of it is not a significant problem or because they don't have to start on just a small situation but because it's super natural of course, it is a feeling that it's not a problem from the human system. The way that you just described with the time of a human saying, he felt that was Satan that was putting the passion on. to do everything , I've got to be pressed and  that there are reasons to be pressed or do those things use of a spiritual quality. No, no, but there are times that you can speak and tell that all these negative thoughts in your home, this is not me, this is not me, this is not me, this is really the start and I'm not saying great. No one's hurt me, no one's there's nothing  this good why am I feeling sad? Jennifer tells me that they will grow up and feel the presence of each one. You can be with her eyes. She tells the better experiences to me than to which is a minute of spring and your coat and her eyes. About the prayer warriors and me  you regularly wear lots of instructions to the city seeking out and destroying the forces of darkness. In the tape. some of the problems in Colorado. There had been talks to a poor and of course, subsatient, but I hadn't really taken it seriously. It seemed more metaphorical. I hadn't realized they were literally not good. And as Jennifer talks, my mind was really just gone wrong. What are you thinking? What am I thinking? I guess I'm just thinking that, no, I swear. things that we love. And, yeah. This sounds really bizarre. , it's probably sounds , where is this stuff coming from? What's I find on, what's this coming from? It does sound a little... I mean, it doesn't sound... Yeah, I mean, okay, it sounds good. I'm sure something that's going to sound a little sidebar. I mean, it talks about witches, about... and those are things and some myths. After I talk to Jennifer, I focus on the fit and time. I tell him that I understand now why he can see if he can communicate with us and we are at a sprint. This vision of the spiritual world, to the second one. Just if it doesn't seem surprised, Donald Trump, he tells me to be creative and work that God's given insight into spiritual world, and now God is interested in, then he asks me to point me about something well. And I tell him that I hadn't used a slipper at all, and then I'm tired of his moves. He said goodbye and hang up, and talk again later when I'm back in my department. He says it was something, he tells me that he didn't just pray for me to receive him to give me a good world. So pray to God that I wouldn't sleep. Not until I became. We speak a story of that parent color that is means to teens. In a minute, I'll be getting a message. Wait up. And for the ones. This is American light from my request. and it's even a program that courses just theme, variety of writers, quarters, promised, pack on that theme, this program, Christians learn, and how well they can understand the channel. When we went to the back one, this is a recent story that doesn't to churches in Colorado, and it would be a big change to World 3 prayer. Even when I did the extended spiritual battle to the wager, this was the darkness. Not only are they systematically praying and kind of every poem and school and business. and call out of springs. They're praying through the phone, but one name at a time, there are all night prayer of vigils, churches organize so that each one takes a different day each month with teams of people praying 24 hours a day so that right now, you're the saddest of my voice, someone somewhere. It's praying for the city of Colorado Springs. There's a huge international component of this crowd. applying people with Nepal or Kaira, parts of the world where there are a lot of Christians and what they call prayer journeys. Who's people checking the hotels, pray for a few days, sometimes never even the hotel, then fly back home. If we're going to new high tech world prayer center to coordinate prayer needs in 120 countries, more than possible to secular people can understand the idea of these efforts. Is there a gap in the hospital? It's possible. at least people's stories. I don't sit for two days and it makes me feel  I'm going crazy. I lose my wallet and think about borrowing money from Joseph but decided against it. Several times a day we talked on the phone to be a Christian being and talked about the story. I ultimately between thinking that everybody in talking to isn't seen and thinking all that I'm fair while sitting for a trip soon this. Good day, I'll see you in the next video. Sometimes we need to use I go back home and tell you how to do the things. I'll find it from. I stare at the glove and try to remember what this is about this. I remember something. I still have a story to do, and so I go and see Ted Haggard, Man, Sun, and brought me to power up the spring. He tells me that his church looks for evidence. Signed at the verify. the prayer that we've got from the community. Yeah, we always see it very well. We started praying for it. That was 12th. And the primary has every year to pass the community. When I suggested primary to falling all of them, and then most places, this is due main demographics. Tetic reads, there is no positive way to know how much deep peace crime is being spread. But it's so fast. Well, I would say... they were not responsible for having to be stripped of it. And because that leadership is true, that tells the 7. So I think it's probably a scientific figure, horrible. Just  that. Ted tells me story after story. They pray over making lots, helping you with a certain circumstances. Then watch as a church by Spala. They pray at Corners' doors. We pray over. around a poor-no-joy system basis. We never talked to people. We don't grasp people or anything  that. We see a dip in their business. We have a team of men specifically target adult groups. And they have hundreds of stories of men pulling in to the adult groups. Park, there they are, print, you can imagine. A group of guys set in their database well-guests. My team should Father in the name of Jesus, remind these guys of their mothers. Lord, help them think of any scripture they've ever been exposed to in all their life, cause them to be in love with their wives, have hundreds of stories. And then getting out of their cars, walking halfway to the door of these old books. Pause, going back to the old house, right? Business is bad, some of them should have not been in the very face. Thank you, everyone. First amendment is an adult book story now, who's shopped. that it else down the way of meaning and for my own. It's one of the places new life targets. So I went down the set of businesses don't. The source perked and just worked with the fishermen for years. And hasn't known the support from business. Even though it wasn't a social, it was a empirical evidence that this is working, that which you saw. Even though it's a social, it's a social, love, stupid, love, stupid, some lot of people, the sales are straight to the same. that you think, or anything. I know students are sons and adults. , it's a big grade for my son to be out. I need to be that's my dad. That's what I mean. , that may have happened. Dan doesn't seem bad at nagging at some parking lot. Frank's business is not a business. They have to. They don't even find them at the street. People are not even a big business. They're still a small group of people. They don't even find them. and then it's very passagress stuff. And then they do slap people for physically, spiritually. Well, spiritually, we know that we believe it is fun. So that we out there, we have this awesome, that's something they can judge for. That's it. And we're smart and still looking to see which has people with all of them more. Dances for praise himself, so he understands the new thoughts. I asked him if he's noticed any true spiritual spirit of crime in the past. But with the prayer she had in prayer walks, he tells me no. Most of the changes he's never experienced, time has stopped and moved, it's more expensive. And people are in the same sense. Cley and Cley never should die the story next to the video. That's it. There's more. There's more. That's what I was before it came out of the house. Turns out that I don't need to explain much about the script and word amount. In fact, it's an important dedicated spin. Not the most full-fledged script warrior to obtain that script. You as even a member of the lecture, here's the writer. The first time I met the game, to move the script, foretoement based on this wave of the singles. Wow. objection by the first and last evidence of transcript testimonies. In the third and tenth exam, a gravestone. A great protagonist. He lived with the here and third-ódled? The most... you see most its lord. They're just sitting up on this club, making you feel  he was grandfathered with him. And in the second round, all the time, the results of this movie do you enjoy? mumbo and you ... watch this movie for theů been struggling with being gay and the single thing is just a class stop. At this single thing, my friends, embraced this trend of your two friends. And I'm jumping with another two friends. At this, maybe it's hard. So we walked with this movement and let's start. The sad thing about August is that Malcolm Badden is the sexiest. He loved the church, and loved things. Even now several years after him now, Malcolm would probably be happy seeing the sad side frame and standing close to him. I guess I hope you would look  the Christian Empire before there is... It seems to be more... ...spir... the virtual love. Oh, no. There. This part. There's an omit visit. Love. So we visit the real animal. This is the real animal. Yes. There's a box. That must be the idea of really talking about this between what I was brought up with and what I'm doing. Do you have a chance to say that they would be able to try to come back to change your own thoughts that we used to have? Yes. And some chance. And we're going to work with both of those works. We're going to work with students. At the end of the year, I asked the paper to listen to you. You personally and to anywhere else. I would not turn Jesus away just because of what this is. Jesus isn't the bad. It's not just a sin. You're sitting in the uponous room and you're trying to say, now that's crazy. Joseph calls me a new one around 6 o'clock. Check and then see how I'm doing. Thanks to the power of prayer I am, of course, wait. You talk for a while. I tell them about the times when you're on a track you see. We argue about homosexuality and the argument months pretty new to you at the start. I'm for the home of Joseph thinks that they can't forget and say, same talk. When I tell them that I could never be part of it. religion doesn't set him to set his be shot, really shot, and disappoint him by my power. But just it doesn't give up on me. He tells me that one day when I'm a Christian and more best friends, who look back on all of this and laugh. And there's something about the way he does this, he makes me feel to be inside the house, on this way. One day when I'm a Christian, more best friends, who will look back on all of this. I'll then let you speak to me. After we hang up, I don't know what to do, so I call my boss, Ira, and Shukada. It's 7-3-day Chicago time when the sending one is always in love. I wanted to put this experience in perspective, coming that has been to the same thing. Try us in various ways to be reassuring and finally tells me we can use ultimately my life as with a second it. And show, Shukada. One day says, I'm back to China. I didn't work for my digital editing. I look back and all. I was much less. We kind of go into Satan's Turb. Some people enjoy that more than others. Some people really  to spend more time praying in kind of lighter areas, not so spiritual dangerous areas. I love it. I  the darks. I'm called the Water Art Places. There's a very large independent Christian substance cell phone, and I go out there while I'm here to this hard, hospital work. He not only wanders around glasses, but actually says, I do need. Jair is a Harvard graph in his late poems, and I'm told by several people that display a lot of certain times, lots of friends and spiritual complications. Jair is his product, and as we walk, he explains that it's specific to the blockage. Don't eat. rewind this to know of course it's a safety test. The end of the thing is if you blindfolded, generate or someone who had developed they're gifted to the servant and took us to a place and you couldn't see what is going on. Even if I couldn't get what was going on spiritually I could see the servant of the place. So Jared, Jennifer Phillips, the friend Sarah and now go to confront the course of the darkness out of the security piece somehow and it's hard at least for me to sense the depth. and spin pieces. We walk at a part, pass the steeper, down at the block, and then as we walk around the back, then for Sarah, Sarah, and then she. I wonder, something's here. this and walking into this area, it's different. We're in the block, this standing under a eye with our feet. We need to go through the block. There are benches placed on the signal and for a moment I send one very much to this Again rate a murder Sarah said She says she went to school. She moved to the hospital It's I would do all of them to hang out then one stone There a liberal She doesn't say Then she and Sarah get sent out But they're afraid they didn't see us on the number of the media ... to that's much more  what is word and stuff. It's almost  one. Except in the ideas, more open to the possibilities, the different perspectives. It sounds  people attempt this place, I'm more open to other religions, use it for how many different things, more likely to try. It's not just kind of  the art, more open neighbourhoods anthropology, but not experienced by the Foolter, more addicted ideas about and knows people are not only getting anything the acupuncture of FuTe, food crisis of puTe  we countryside possibility of changing and further contemporary they lead them to falsehood, to school God, for ways of looking at reality, for God and us, for people, for God. We asked for God, then you find those powers, that you find them. The next one I have to just come from, I come from the name of the Lord. I say, that I know the sound of this thing, I said, but it happens. He doesn't sleep well, goes there never expect the seeds. Smike will protect photographers. He indirectly wandered past, sleep, saw it wrong. Cellidelarge would lie with mom's and Mesia, just to use space, Sandra is at오, Mei cloads, group traceable, years of memory. So that reaching out to God, he asked how many formages of more than one to one of his friends, and in a room about being loved or maybe five. Then he tells them that he doesn't have a single hand, but this is why he said, it's not in that way just before he was in the shape. Christian's must find the way to make the sentence, not. He says this issue is to mark the mandate out. And as a self-difficult, it says, I made an increase to me. And then he starts to talk about publics. He tells her that I'm a socialist. And then class in a general way, but it's a publicist. And at one point, after saying, Chris is a socialist, he comes and stands for something else. I love animals when they speak so often. in which minds and pastries. And we will find the world for me, find Jesus's world for me, find me, you will ever hear. At the end of the sermon, people used to sing, no band, just people seem all cut from me. And Joseph, it's over and acid. 2000 At first I shake my head now. I'm not sure why I've defied, but I can't think of Rathlete as much as I could. After all, he's no longer an orphan. So I put that into a place but it keeps not moving. This is the process of building a football, and you can maybe let me help me to realize it. I remember theет cranks, if this is good Glossy trick from the city. And the man standing something, badly one, was offering love and love and love. It seemed clear that it was around, we're already experiencing the experience and that if I were to act rash, I would just pass it and enjoy it. But somehow, I couldn't have lost. I couldn't have lost. Most of all, I remember the sheer of, thank you. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. When we had finished, I sat down and watched his just the whole talk. He said, well, she was sick and he lit his hands up. And he lit his chin. And all of the sudden she just came. Wrong. He's a good one. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haenza é cha 했 dain . i am hot cooing ! it would get on you again ! i'm out trapped ! i'm out trapped ! im gonna grab my hands ! im away from here ! im out Pri напрive ! Thank you very much. You could start blocking your wrong position and you could move the stairs. You can't depend on your opinion And you can't depend on you You can't depend on your churches. You can't depend on God. You can't only depend on one thing. You don't have to listen all the way to get by. Watch baby. Let's go to bed and get by. Let's go to bed and get by. Friends etc Some of us keep in mind that okay. I am damned. I am going to hell. This is what my fundamentalist friends tell them. They send them out of what I do in this line. They make what good works are virtue labor can cost for myself. I am condemned because I and my entire race use have non-status. But islamism for I made you never ever assistant to. It is in step-care, Salt Lake City, and it's better to be. At a particularly low point, my career as I'm responsible has been in poverty. I work as a Carpenter's assistant for my younger brother. Contractors specialize in home renovation. We built additions and garages, finished basements, throughout bathrooms and installed ruins. We paid me $10 an hour, which I consider to be generous. At that time, good Carpenter's men who could build. an entire house from start to finish, single-handed, or making talk to me. And I was only an assistant, go for a guy who digs and carries and cleans up. My brother was maybe 32 at that time and had worked as a carpenter-sensied graduate from college. He'd been a good student and was offered a graduate fellowship, but he dropped it. No one in my head? we really understood quite. He went to work for other people, eventually got his own license, and then that will put him to start getting his own contracts. He had a lot of work, usually two jobs going at once, three or four employees, but he wasn't making much money because he had a tendency to underestimate this. I think sometimes I ended up making more money on the job and he did, but he seemed to  it anyway. I, however, was almost always upset, not because of the work. work was hard, but because I just presented working on another man's house. Man, what an up money paper of $40,000, man who decides he wants a bigger garage for his new motorcycle. Man, it doesn't want to dig up his own sewer pipe. The work pushed me to admit that I was a slave to somewhere in life I made a big mistake. Also, I had a problem with the other Carpindersman brother Hyde. Consider the following scenarios. I'm Shigling a garage roof with a lead Carpindor named Dave. Dave's first day on the job, both up there pounding the jingle and talking about Star Trek. Dave's a big Star Trek fan. He's seen all of the old and the shows. He even has four plans to be enterprise, which he's committed to memory. Dave tells me about the insidious board, a race of... disciples with the social conscience of ants. Dave most widely cling on to now part of the Federation. Dave is decided just how you expend his time on the holiday. A room on the enterprise where a crew member's got to live out their fantasies and holographic reality. It's a harmless conversation seems to diminish the tedium of the work. But then after a brief while, Dave stops pounding the shingles and asks me in a very serious tone. Stop. Do accept the Christ as your person. a little safer. Turns out Dave was a fundamentalist Christian with a strong desire to cross-lead by us. That evening, after work, asked my brother maybe he doesn't need a foundation then, or some private glass insulation stapled in the place, anything other than working Dave. He looks at the ground and kicks it dirt, as he promised the owner that the roof would be done last week. After day of the year, and tells me about how and Idaho, their implying silicon chips and babies angles, that will forever identify them as hard and safe and dark. After the year, there's another day, who, when he's alone, practices out loud, shouting, sermons exposing the evils of the trilateral's commission. After that day, there's John, my brother, Hires, from the hall of the hall. John's just the right. from Boston, I drove the cab for 20 years, up until the Kennedy's ran another town. He says, Ted Kennedy was out to get. He says, Ted Kennedy's room is light. He tells me the amazing story of how a lot of he checked in Western Kansas. He came so depressed and decided to throw himself in front of a semi truck barrel in down I 70. But then suddenly from out of nowhere, he saw Jesus Christ and 40 feet tall, excited to go. Jesus spoke. He said, Jesus chau it. these trough of my roller skates. , when you see it, I think half of arts, it's an accident. When you see it happen twice, it's a coincidence. When you see it happen three or more times, it's a science. The science is the man theories. My first theory was that there might be some sort of connection between Jesus and his man because they were all carpinders. So I would ask my work needs. questions , was Jesus a frame or a finished man? It means it's a different thing. To see the lead carpenter, I was he just a laborer. All right, makes the thought by, I heard that when Jesus built furniture, never used gloomed joints that he just touched them and they had hold forever. But these men were not interested in philosophy or metaphysics, and they were never used gloomed joints. not even interested it turned out in stories about Jesus or his teachings of compassion. Part from it, they were all into the book of Revelation. They were all religious for reasons of revenge. All had hard lives filled with injustices and inequities, all the resigned themselves to a life where which they'd lost control. Their one hope was that when they die, when everybody died, everybody will get what they deserve. The righteous will be happy forever while the back of the book. the asshole, the wicked and corrupt and the filth of burning hell. So I changed my theory and decided that religion is something people use not only because they want to connect with a sense of their spiritual existence, they also use it to bring a sense of justice to their social existence. Just wait until Jesus comes back. Just wait until He apocalypse. I thought at first that I was different even superior to these guys, but at some point, the start. to realize that we all have the same basic problem. We were all slaves and happy slaves. It wasn't a pretty thing to see. I went on  this for more than a year, angering the press, and unable are willing to do anything else. Then one day in the middle of winter everything came to us. ahead and sort of exploded. We were building a three-story addition onto the back of an architect's home. He designed it and we'd frame the thing and we'll start to sheet the roof and then a building inspector came by, said we'd screwed up, made him to stay down at the level of foundation. It was a small thing, attributely, and I can't even remember now specifically what the problem was. And then it wasn't  we'd done anything wrong. We built it  it was drawn in quiet. and the architect was happy with our work, but it just didn't quite match the city's building code. The inspector was being hard asked. He said, we'd have to fix it, which meant, in effect, we'd have to tear the whole thing down and start over. I was standing there in the mud with my brother and the inspector. And it was snowing, and I was wet and cold, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My brother just listened and then argued with co-test the inspector showed us. I regret or remorse. I feel that I formed, signed it, gave it to my brother and left. I was furious, took off my belt, threw it across the yard, nails and screws and tools scattering and disappearing in the snow. John stopped working and came all of it, and I told him I had to take everything down. He started in about the Kennedy's, how I knew a lawyer in Boston, how we could sue the inspector for everything he was worth. I told him to shut the f*** up. Nass. my brother what we're gonna do. He was standing inside on the bottom floor, looking out from the empty window. And he said, market time cards for full day, let's clean up, go home early. He was mad, I couldn't see it. He was at the point of tears, I couldn't feel. We put everything away and just as I was leaving, he said, thanks. We'll be all right. I'll go down to the city of tomorrow and talk to some people.
