  "text": "One, two. WVE's Chicago Public Radio International, it's a American life in my class. And I'm standing at the corner of diversity in Broadway, which is Chicago. As I've recorded this, it's just a few minutes after three o'clock on a weekday afternoon in Chicago. And people are everywhere. And no, it's still the middle of the workday. In the great shop, just off the corner I stuck my head in and there are people at the tables, some of them were just sitting there reading books. So to guys, speaking Spanish, walking and finding a friend who greeted them in Spanish and they headed out. Guy and a go-teen and it kept just walked by wearing a pair of professional grade, stereo, headphones around his neck. I'm talking to his buddy. Nice 10 minutes. I've seen three different people. Oh man. Greg, professional grade, stereo headphones. Just on the street. I didn't even know this was a trend. Hey, don't. Guy in the suit, it's very... In the hours when Mr. S. Alright, we're at school. There is a whole vibe going on out here. There is a whole vibe going on out here. Outside and alternate world I would say it's a world with its own rules, but it's rules are actually a lot  the rules of Saturday Except taking place during the week and different people Take part This is the secret world of daytime That's it Time to turn the red light Can't get his plates. Well, back in the studio now. Today we take a little tour in the secret life of daytime with 5 separate. stories, and I plan why aren't you at work in which one in trepid recorder has a little chat. Some of those people who are on the street at three, and two, and world full of soybeans, and men turn to love. The surprising story of how people kill time at one link in the Brasco crane uphitter. I can really, did you have a few of childhood? The tale of the secret places that children go during the day in one town in Vermont. and for the visible man. A postman explains how it is that he can be so much apart of the scenery that people admit crimes in front of him. Crimes are quiet daytime streets as it he is not there. At five, 82, 50 a day, Breitermone is Simpson reads from a forthcoming novel about the daytime life in Philip Kino-Nanies, bringing hours in which they run, roughly homes. certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Let's begin with a few simple answers to a few simple questions. All those people you see in the middle of the day when we run out to a doctor's appointment, the CNN copy shops and bookstores in most cities and suburbs. Who are they? Why are they not at work? Investigative reporter George Gerley tackled these top questions. The scene equal to Ireland. I'd be  to call. You're in heaven. Hello, America. I do what we all are tempted to do. On four afternoons, I approach these people. And ask them why they weren't at work. What exactly were they doing? We haven't seen each other in about a week and a half, so we thought, , it's got to bite to eat. It's beautiful to also come and part. You retired you still work. I am semi-retired. I'm old enough to collect social security But I still work a few days a week cause next question is what kind of work do you do? I'm going home on my cat. I'm afraid Do you think that you've had a productive day today? I got shower What are you doing right now  why are you? I'm here on a business trip. Okay, there we go. So Sam, I wear it. You're okay. I'm so sick of it. As it turns out, a lot of these people actually have jobs. The kind of jobs where they set their own hours, work nights, so weekends. Their actors, sculptors, bartenders. And that one guy takes care of primates and other mammals at the Bronx Zoo, who is Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. Please from his cage. She spends. those afternoon drinking screwdrivers, guilt-free. Daytime hours are different if you not work. They're about going with the flow, one thing leading to another. Alana Canti, a 50-year-old English tutor from New Jersey, was in Central Park, purely by coincidences. I was an extra on a TV show, which I got because I saw from depression and I was sort of actively confused stuff that, but I have a... friend staying at my house and he signed up with an agency and they called last night and I took the call and I said, do you need any women? He said, sure, okay. So I had to show up at 8 o'clock at the boat house and I was taping up a scene from the program once in a dinner, I think. And basically we got $41 for standing in a crowd. So here I am. I would love to be there in New York, all because my friend went to an extra agency. It's been the most productive thing I've done today, is put my check in the bank. This is Jonathan Bradley, a beard of 25 year old. I met him at the Angelica, a theater in Saohau that shows mostly independent films. It was around 3 o'clock, and a dozen or so people were waiting for their film to be announced for just hanging out. Inside the theater cafe, Jonathan was reading Billage Voice after seeing his move, killing some time before his customer service gig at a website. I asked him. anything else he could have achieved. The only thing I could have done today was maybe if I was home, I could have made some phone calls for our meditation group and the Buddhist group and we're looking for a space. So if I was in a homeless morning I could have made some phone calls on that. Well, when Google would say about your day so far, that's a difficult question to answer because the Buddhism is rarely a thing that kind of  it. dogmatic  that that says you should you should perform this way but I think  use the time wisely might be my good general statement. Cross the cafe was Randy Majorer along here at 34-year-old actor. He just picked up some headshots and now was spending some free time visiting a friend. But he didn't feel  he was wasting time. For actor apparently, some were being awake to the world counts as well. Sort of  my errands are , for me, part of my education, because being out on the street and walking around and seeing new things and seeing people, I try to be as... As observant as I possibly can in regard to just, ... What I see, , I mean, as an actor, I'm constantly setting character in people. So... So every day every day right outside my door is an Experience I think something alone Loving it's a kind of  it's a colloquial Loving this is Howard Monk. He told me he does a little day trade and inherited so money You was sitting out of bench and drinking a lot to outside a mock street art gallery helps run. Wearing a floppy blue hat and shades, keeping catch and razor for 45 minutes and look tie on my nearly be a tiffy. Loosing, I would say that a lot of my life is lofy and with spurts of activity in the team, sort of trying to make up for lofy. Lofy, lofing is me. What do you think is that 95% of people  you going is a subway that you're doing. when I was a kid I had summer jobs where I worked nine to five and I wore suit and a tie my uncle ran Simon and Schuster the publishing house and I went down there and I took the subway to Rockefeller's center and I did this and then I cried this is the way to go and then something happened something happens along the way and I think you sort of I went a little bit off that lands are dad made oh oh And once you get away from it, once you get away from being able to get up and go to work in 95 I think it's it would take a catastrophic lifestyle change Or in major lifestyle change that's a bust pulling our offenders To get me back into nine to five No, I admire them. I'd look at them and I in some ways I have They make me feel inadequate that they They have somehow, , stuck nose to the grindstone and I don't cry that is being  something that I would never do. These are people who are heroes. While people  Howard are passing peacefully in the sun, the heroes are inside of their looking at the clock, tired of the stress, the poor social interaction, the meetings, the constant threat of having to think and say things to smile at the same old co-worker. Some of whom have become intoler, talking on the phone loudly, laughing without justification, making slurping noises during their lunch. So the heroes do what any reasonable person would do. They stop working. while they're at work. Click around, check their stocks, shuffle the office kitchen, Howard at least admits he's taking it easy, and he's outside where the daytime hours have their own poetry,  the hours of two to four. Between two and four is a very interesting time because things, the feeling of it, the day changes almost the most from two to four, and well the shadows get worse. longer, people start to get a little more energized. I think this is a, the evening crowd, the evening the night people start to sort of stir at around 2 to 4 and there's a little more energy. The playing hookie for the 95 world isn't all lyrical musings about the changing the life. Not only is this going to feel sorry for you. But there is a special kind of anxiety that's particular to skipping normal work. It can take a little while to get used to the idea that the regular world just goes on about its business without. This is my friend Doug Allen who made some money as a lawyer, and now doesn't work in 95 job. Walking around outside, because New York is such a business oriented city where people are walking around on the streets going the day. There's this sense of energy. and going from this place to that place and they're going, they're heading there and they have direction. I'm outside. I don't have any place I have to be and I'm not part of that group. Docs spends the days on no particular schedule. Negotiating business deals, writing short stories, so far haven't been published and puddling around. Because I don't have a typical 9-5. the reality is that I'm never free. I'm never not working. I don't have that sense of closure to the day ever, ever, ever. I always feel  there's something more I can be doing, there's something more I walk into the bathroom and I'll take work in with you. Doug and I headed outside, wandering through Gingen Square Park. The Heartland Brewery, Barnes & Noble, and ended up at the Old Town Bar. A few solitary drinkers were there. Doug ordered vodka, I got whisked. Now was almost five on Friday, the end of the traditional work. That stillness and dream equality of daytime is being replaced by Manhattan, noise, and energy. As little groups of nine to five were filed into the Old Town. We watched them. They clearly... come straight from the office, excited that it last the drinking begins. At last they've earned the right to recreation so circumstance that it's duration is even included in its name. Happy out. Which, barely as a reporter for the New York Observer, he first investigated the secret life of daytime workers. Holding hands of little hands. Please. I wish that nice work if you can get it and you can get it if you try. I'm strolling with the one more. Back to in a world full of soybeans the men turned to love. But it's now head to a grain elevator on the outskirts of Lincoln Nebraska rising 150 feet above cornfields and railroad tracks holding over a million bushes of corn, soy beans, weed and mylo make a nomad explains how the daylight hours are just being food. grain elevators are In many ways, the skyscrapers of rural America, they are the structures in the far corner of the paintings, the towers that pierced and otherwise uninterrupted sky. There are five men who work in one particular grain elevator in Lincoln, and they spend their days at one end or the other to extremes. During harvest time, they've been known to work more than 48 hours straight, but in the winter and early spring, when crops lie dormant under layers of frost, and just a few farm traps. pulling over the course of the day. The workers at this gray now are better. Something else on our minds. We have so much to pay to each other. So much to give to you. So much to share with you. Oh, yeah, we all work in the house. But, , every now and then, if a truck comes in, Dr. Marshall is kind of nice. It's when they come in right in the middle of their heated up things. It's going to get to come in. I can't wait. It's for you. I can't wait. Just choose your face. How old are you? How much will this year be missed? Good. You're fast. And we'll be good. Every day at 11 a.m. Please men stop with their doing. Get out their sandwiches or heat up some Chinese food. And gather together in front of the small television set in the office to watch the so-pop-re the young and the restless. They've been watching it for years. This is no casual viewing. It's an obsession. And we're here. See you. What was it to me? It's an eye-meek I'm standing white, a boy you're age with everything going for you. Feel the nature of literary of the novel. Did you did? Bonson of Toria's life problem. Yeah, she lost another son to alcohol some moves. The five men who worked in the elevator seemed for the most part, just  the kind of guys you'd expect to load grain off of trucks and on-between, by the time. Most are thick and burly. They have calist hands, where heavy work boots and are often completely covered and dust. But their knowledge of the young and the restless is in cycle pede. They talk about it the way guys talk about sports. They do a lot of yelling at the screen. They argue about who's stalking the young, saucy, Victoria Newman. They have lengthy discussions about a business tycoon's Missing Spurmsamball, and where it will end up. No ol' is supervisor, patient. explained to me how it is that we can see and or ended up in Generalist City, the fictional setting of the show. Her father was a missionary in India and was presumed dead in a raid on the village and he didn't even know he had this thought around him. He had it. I don't know who she was, where she's going. You can say little is right now, if Jill wants to say little is looking for the mother to find out if Matt. is, rocks. Oh, rock. That's Rick. He's 39 and has been doing grain elevator work for 10 years. He's married has a six year old son and a job on the side as an exterminator. If I'm in the home by myself and my wife and my kid be gone, I'm just sitting there and pop a beer about 11 o'clock and sit in much soaps. When he was a kid in the early 70s, he watched the young and the restless with his mom and his sisters. And these days, he's responsible for telling his wife what's going on in the show. He's even been known to read soap opera Digest while standing in line at the supermarket. So what do a bunch of relatively macho guys see in a show that supposedly targeted at women? I can tell you that when the man at the grain elevator watch, they keep a running commentary during the love scenes, but sit in rap attention. and the characters talk business. And maybe the show is designed with this in mind. For every mushy relationship story, there are bankfile and shady business deals involving Jack Abbott's company, Jibou, and Jack's Nemesis, Victor Newman. That's really the best part of the show. Victor, trying to get back to both, and buying all the banks and all that. We watch another one's more beautiful. Everybody's crying on that show is one. today, it's more , it's a more mushy. It was pretty good for about a year and an old sudden, which is, Dino, always debauchable. For these guys, the fascination with the young and the restless has a lot to do with one character, the enigmatic, inscrutable Victor Newman. When Victor's on screen, the man are silent. With his ambiguous foreign sounding accent, the Dino-Fied Grey. around his temples and the trademark leather sport coat that suggests he's far too a court to wear an ordinary business suit. Victor is power and carnit. You can't describe him without sounding  a soap opera. Win in one hand, man idolize him. The way he talks and he's got him whispered. He misses his voice. When he raises his voice, that means he's pretty upset. And whatever, Victor wants Victor gives me kisses. Get off. money that you can think of. I mean he's buying all the banks so he can get back at Jack and he told Jack when he wanted to get to help me back. He walked into his office where Jack was sitting in the chair. I think I might be very hot shot. He did the those hands on his pocket and leaned back and whispered and whispered and gradually walked over to the fire police. He grabbed this picture off of the box. Turned around. That was really simple. I'm going to crush you. Just remember that. And then put his hands on his collar, tucked in, Shred the shoulder, and walked out  a gem. And then Jack, I'm telling you, he was scared then. I'm telling you, he was scared then. Victor is a force. that seems to spin  a tornado across the fields that surround the elevator. Around here, soaps are watched as closely as the weather. We work in a farm area, and a lot of the farmers I taught you. They'll come in with their greenery or if they're out in the field, they always take through lunch and I would say probably 90% of the farmers and their lives. Come in, have their lunch, and watch the soaps. You'll miss it here and talk in the phone even about that. So taking that lunch break and watching this show. During the slow months, the TV will stay on after the young and the restless, and if the man aren't doing anything else, we'll come into the office and watch other selves. But in a month or so, late spring will warm up the fields, and things will get busier and busier until harvest time. When the work will be nonstop. As no oldams, 250 bushels of soybeans into the truck pit, a load for one of just a few trucks that came in today. You can only imagine what it's  to get 100 or more of these trucks every day, and then spend the night loading them into trains and mile-longs. These are great beans, yeah. This year, almost all the crops in Nebraska will build their qualities. These guys might miss some episodes come fall. By then, the stocker might have been caught. The father of Ashley's baby might be revealed, and Victor's sperm sample might have been put to use. But part of the beauty of soaps is that they move so slowly that you can miss months, even years, and still be able to catch up in a few days. Soaps are nothing, it's not daily reminders, and the virtues of patience. Just as the farming community waits for the seasons to change, waits for the corn to grow, waits for the price of grain to rise enough so that they might turn a profit. They wait for some... to actually happen on the young, the restless. We hear enough these days about how fast the world is moving. Maybe it's good to know that there's still a place in America where stalkers are at large and sperm samples are up for grabs but we're time to move slowly. Making down, you're Lincoln. Coming up, either rain or sleep, nor- snow, if  what I mean, delivering the mail on the west side of Chicago, where the only people in the streets during the day are drug dealers. To people who can use the word snow for drugs anymore, we don't even bother to answer that question. In a minute, a public radio international, when our program continues. Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh, baby! This is American Life, my class. Each week I'm a program of course, which is a theme for native different stories on their theme. Our program today is Secret Life Daytime. stories of all the things that have been in the world, unnoticed and broad daylight. Things in the name of this miss because we are stuck at our jobs. We've arrived at Act 3 of our show, Act 3, the geography of childhood. In the early 1970s, a geography-named Roger Hart did a study of exactly where it is that children go during the daytime. For two years, we followed 80-6 children, all the children in a small town in Vermont, during the hours when parents were away at work. This rural setting nearly every child. Nearly everyone had a secret hiding place on one. Spot that adults usually did not know about. Full little boy made of clearing and his parents' prop fields. Some sisters had a spot in living woods and playhouse with rocks from river. They were set up as a pretend telephone that had a pretend TV. The road and the cornstead of these places in those days, that is the town where children would think they wouldn't want to. Sometimes I would walk through a field, very tall grass, and then find a little of a field. A couple of shelves for you to see. decorated with little objects, but no walls. And this was the special place. Two children who I was just chatting with. One day I think I would pour in five years old. And he said, I always just love to show you our furniture. So I've never seen a furniture before. So I followed them. And they had this little place that was about, really, with a green trees. And beneath it, was found at the table. pick and then turn into beds and pillows. They were imaginary windows which they shared in their agreement location off which did not receive. It was a very very beautiful space. It's a so romantic. Yeah I mean it is perhaps the fact was I happened to choose a small town then it's unwanted something is manageable look at later on that huge research in real city and certainly in this city that has been lots of places that are also very special built creating by children as part of their desire commonly with one or two close friends to create a special place that we've been looking at for  often on the rooftop sometimes in the sun sometimes the need to stew What do you think it is that it was so common for children to have a see-through point? They're engaging in developing sense of self, some separate and others. That is a psychological struggle for it. Takes a lifetime, in the very early age, which children, for example, turn a chair upside down and go inside and see this is my place. They're engaging in that kind of developing sense of self. Did you make actual maps? I've got one map of just three houses which show all the places they can't spawn in one and I think seven children. And it's probably 40 locations that are right at little houses for racing tracks or villages or cities or airports they built. And in a small town  earlier if you were studying, was daytime. in particular the profits of children, that is how it kind of belongs to the kids. Yes, I think that used to be true, even in cities, that the greatest uses of the outdoor space were children, and they were running through the elbow, that the people who have to find close to home and interesting environment for themselves. So, well... So there's changed in Norm's for children. Children now spend much more time in either program activities or super-perfecting. On the sub-HM2 website. Children are not outside. You don't see kids in the screen. Most neighborhoods. You don't hear them. None. You don't hear them. You don't hear them. I can use to. But I know with kids who live here in the city of Chicago,  parents are careful about the kids. Simply won't let them act. and the worst neighborhood the most strictly the kids are controlled. And so their daytime space literally is just in the living room. Yeah, I mean even in the daytime also their rural market children don't have a freedom of social. This is everywhere. Jagger for Roger Hart, he published his findings in a book called Children's Experience of Place, and now out of print you can see a few of his maps on the jog. of childhood in the Disamerican Life website www.dislike.org. At 4 in Disbelmion. It's not just children in the elderly who are left in quiet residential neighborhoods when working people are making their own work. How do people pass them? They see things. Disamerican Life videos are out of school and spend a few hours with the Chicago Postman to find out what exactly it is that is. When a botanist walks through a neighborhood, he might classify the house as he but what kind of trees you're going in the yard? That one has an old maple ground. This one in oak. It only makes sense then that when a male man walks through a new room, he has his own son. Who just rode here, you're trying to dare. You need different male-buckers. Just about a male receptacle. There he is, you're trying to own this right here. You have your male bucket, you have your male slots, you have a, set a wall of male boxes, you have a minute. You see the different forms as we make these delivered. Henry, I'm now laying on the highway side here in the Honest Street now. One of the blocks that I deliver and so far I look  a thick street. The only car, the only thing is moving now to the car, even if it's between one of working on the lawn. And down the block. But I see a gas stand in them up to block them. Now what are you doing? Or what are you waiting on? I have no idea. Actually Henry's line. He has somebody. After all, there's only  two categories of people who see him. This part is wrapped in a day. I wonder the recovery is in gang members. The guy in the corner, he's not lonely. But Henry's work this evening with the 20 years, he has to come back every day. So no matter how many times I ask him to be more explicit, he never read birth with this guy as he passed him. He calls him businessmen workers for boys and women Yeah, you guys on Tommy the retirees he calls dear and a surprising number are waiting for him to do it Yeah, then no one heard came out. Yeah Alright, yeah. Really add an ear, sometimes I'll go to the tip. We see the male pound and the bark and whatever, something is wrong. , you put the male in there and nothing good. Something wrong. Let's all know if I'll go. That was one where I had to stop with police often there. I was late. She was late in the morning. but no, she not has no, but her door was open and is never open. It is never ever open. So I started to leave, concept and told her, I said that this lady here lives on my right now and I think what that door is wide open is she never leaves it open. Quarcing it from me, that particular time, the lady had failed again and heard of them. So they were able to take it to the hospital. Mm-hm. Just a one. But it's done happen in many cities and in minutes. Jeff O'Rop! Henry and I turned down the side street. Several young men and starter jackets and baseball caps, slouch against the park car. Another guy stands on opposite corner. Right now, as you see, there's only a few of them out. If you look at some of the corners, you'll find one or two of them out there. You'll find one. You'll find one. It is that good we just work in. And how did this interview? Well they've made their faith they've received me and it's not for it. We're not friendly. We deserve the weight or hello. How are you doing? We're going on. As we walk by, I see one guy slap something and just second guys outskirts the wrong. The second guy slips his hand and his pocket. The two never look at each other. What's weird is that? they make no effort to hide what's really is a violation of federal drug policy and front of a federal employee . And he says it's always  this. Simply because they don't feel the number of threats. They do not feel the number threat to them. In fact, chance you drove around in a big court in most cases they were slow down. Whatever activities they want to, they will stop. , because they're hesitant, . But as far as I'm concerned, I'm not afraid. They know I'm not afraid. Gochman? you don't what they're gonna do. I have nothing more or less to do with they they know that I'm not gonna buy them and they don't buy one. So they don't start to be  stopping just because  a cloud because sky is exactly exactly exactly exactly right. That's part of the day I'm a matter of fact this thing  I'm part of the picture. Yeah there are things that are happen naturally. It rains naturally. You have no say it. and if someone, hey how you doing there? If someone died, you have no control over it. Same with the male man, you have no control over the male man coming into your heart. Or not. The male man going beyond every block. And that's where you go. Don't worry, the way you're doing it, the guy moves. And he part of Tane was responsible for his responsibility, because otherwise we wouldn't know where he's at. This is a customer that , but I knew for a while he had been on the rough rough two or three years. Well, what he was, I was coming up to his house. He decided to do something. Take him with you. Oh, yeah, I'm here. , this is the... I'm getting the call, I've already told him this is for it. It's not. Wait, wait. Well, he's telling me he's gone. again much. You're gonna get much it. And I keep telling him well isn't it for it, he knew a dress. Tell him to probably be there tomorrow or the day after. And he says well he came away. And look  he was going to hook me as something because he was taking a jacket on. And when he came to me, he'd go at him his round and told me that's my mail me. You don't mess with me. , so he went on that as business. No problem. Oh, I just thank them. How you doing here? I just thank them for what they did. They told me when no problem. They'd be called, you've been around it too long, but anybody would be less with you. After two hours of walking, we've come across only a handful of people. Maybe a half a dozen workers. One guy home from his job on vacation, standing and serving his hot lawn. Four or five disembodied voices, changing pleasant breeze to the mouse lawn. And short, the people left in a primarily residential neighborhood, during non-residential hours. Henry doesn't get lonely about, the fewer people the better. In fact, he says he likes winter best, the empty days in mid-Jaymore, when it's only him and the occasional drug dealer on the street. But if there's no one on them. especially at the letters of cat. That's when he gets worried. Anytime the work is disappeared for a period of time, that's when he's tired, more or less thinking, more sick. You think it should be something for out here today, but it's not! That's this Gary pond. Because in most cases, if there's been noise outside all along, every day, they know that there's nothing. Something has happened somewhere or something will happen. You can open it right, all in Services, but you can placement it. Without any Molotov cell, you can selectライ and select ШC1, try Chy Okinawa I want to drag it out in my shoulder label daa'ata is But there's absolutely nobody in there. And if you want to get away with me, let me hold you up and do what I'm doing. And there's  that, other people from the woods park, taking another route. Henry doesn't have that choice. He's the stickings. I'm glad to see you! That's fun, man. Thank you for the way. As I was of walking one morning for pleasure, I spied a couple inches round the floor. His head was thrown back in his burping and as he approached he was singing the song. at 5, 8, 2, 50 a day. Some neighborhoods are wealthy enough that they somehow keep those unsightly drug dealers off the corners. There, the daytime hours are filled with other kinds of people. In some places its children's nannies who occupy the lovely houses during the day, with their own second community, second set of lives, in the same space. Monocence and has this excerpt from a forthcoming novel, the excerpt is told in the voice of Philoponon상이, the one and that it's a beautiful part of the community of the planet. It's an wonderful performance. Ruth told me when I first came here, I don't need to teach you children. You have been a mother to five she said, , children are not called. But most you have to think about the mother. Here, the mothers of the ones who have a tantrums. You may have had nins, but you have not before been me. I hold my hands open in front of you to take away whatever my employer was beginning. If she starts to saw a button, I finish. If she is rinsing a letter, I say, I will be the one. When the guy spills something in pounds of wet napkin at the spot, I reach out my hands and say, give it to me, I will make it through you. All the while in the small. It is not hard, no, not when you want to put this. Aha! have five purposes, the youngest 17, and from medicine. But I have a good job. The parents of Richard Gettin were all well they eat their breakfast, I fixed their bed, take the glass of water from the side table, took up meetings. I straightened a bathroom passing the top to his First, he was already done. Always the parents first, he'd send. A kid cannot fire you, even here. They can love you, but they cannot pay you. And anyone, they will forgive. Ruth told me, you have always to talk to him, even when he is still at baby. He is very important to take you towards. And I did, more than to my kids because my kids, I had one after the other five and ten years. But with Ricardo, I just talked and talked. I tell him everything and now see, he's very dull dull. He understands more than 100 words to go along. In the class of 2010 at Harvard University, which is where the parents of the party would  him to go, There will be 20 Santa Monica boys saying to the cooks in the cafeteria and excuse. Where is my dokel? And wander by then will be lying in the hammer back in the Philippines. What poor if I am asking you? It is young. It is not yet understand rest. Rousseette, when I started the precarious, I am not going to tell you how to love him, because either that will happen or it won't. And either that will happen or it won't. And four jobs twenty-five years only once it did not happen to her and then you need to quit because you cannot do the job if you do not love the baby. No, we'll set to meet the beginning. I will not tell you how to love. I wouldn't if I could because what I would tell you if I knew would be how not to so much because you will love him the same as you are and they never do. They love you that it is not this. saying, I told her then, I know I know I am a mother too. But now I think you can keep them until they are five. Then they will never forget me. I asked for a carder. Will you remember your wander? Why? He says, you are not going away. Some day, I will return to the circle. Why? What will you do then? I will go and sit in my house. Stare at my diplomas. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come to want. I have something for you, I say. Because he is very angry. Usually, it is the dad. But now, it was the mother he was in. She put a hand to her eye and I got ice the way I do with his eyes. So I take him in my arms away. I am on the ground now in the yard, and he is strong, I cannot so easily hold him still. And I want to hold a lie. I do not have anything for him, so I make promises. Someday, I am going to take you home of meeting three things, and there we will make the ice can. He is still in my arms, but he is not in longer fighting. His bones are different now, not pushing to get out. They fall in the pattern  the veins of the leaf. I will put you in my pocket and see you one candy every day. And you will be happy. Because the ocean in our place, it is very blue. The sky, it is higher than him, and the fruits that grow on trees, very sweet. His head is down to the ground between his own knees, but his listening. He is better now, slower, and just hot. I see through the window his mother on a telephone. She holds the ice to her eye and walks around the kitchen, talking to her she feels proud into boxes. He got to him. friend long distance, a woman who does not work, and he reads many books about the raising the children. When my employer becomes upset she calls this friend a full-time mother. But he is better known. Only his mouth, he is still smeared outside the edges. He will come with me. I lift him into the stroller and calm some candy. I will grab the ice candy just candy with him by here. do not tell your mother. I say, excuse, but we are going now. Is that okay? Thank you, Wanda. This is how my employer believes she cannot live without me. She is telling her friend who reads the books, how he is better with me than her. And her friend will tell her is Cooked Monal. We are just alone, but Cardo will be. This neighborhood is ours during the daytime. You did not see the white mother's walking, only getting in and out of cars carrying shopping rooms. I am pushing him in the stroller in the sits. That is the good of fighting, next and very time. the sun is solid  many small weights on our arms. I passed by the park and in the distance we see friends, babysitters, and they wait, but he doesn't want to get out of his strobe, so we just roll and do the tall trees. When we return home, I have ready at project. We are putting into cardboard all the coins in the house. Ricardo is doing it with me. In his mother told us we could use the pennies to put in the Chuchubang, which is for our tickets and filaments. I told my employers ready when they go to Europe to celebrate their 10th anniversary. I will take Ricardo to the Philippines. We are also finding nickels and dines and quarters and I have the ground toage from the bank for those two. It is a hunt at Tel Rapan. There is always money in this house where people empty at Katy vanquillin, and as a friend of yours he is very knowledgeable in México. For Carter was a very good worker. We just pile of logs and finished coins. If we can also save the money that is recorded in times and nickels, we will have a lot. Already I have saved 75, but I will have to find the right way to ask. The pennies they are already hours. But the rest, I will ask the mother of a car, not the damn. At the bank we waited a long time. Then when we get to the front, the lady is all business, making a total of the world dimes. At town of this little man rolled the nickels by himself. When the lady finishes the silver, I begin to lift the bag of pennies from his wagon. They are heavy. We will get $40 from nickels, $27 from dimes, and $103 from pennies. But the lady is pushing our pennies back out of the cage. He cannot take pennies, she says. For Carter, whom I've lifted up to see, gives one back to me. He can't use this, she says. For a second, his face changes. Then... his born and he throws the role of pennies at the lady's face. Her hand goes to the place above her eye and she says, I cannot help you. She has already given us the paper money from the other coins. She is looking at me, okay. I have seen real hate only a few times in my life. For a minute, I am honest. The shape. diamonds in the shopping. The she is her bubbly eye and I am not white. Come on, Rekarto. I am fighting him into the wagon. I will pull all the roles of Penny's auntie. We will make our get away. He sees a garbage can and he runs dumping pennies in the open top. He is still crying but he is mad now, also mad. I have to stop him. This is not white or ever. Within what I do is almost tack on. Wand is not a big person. I get on the floor and hold him until the fight is out. Then I tell him the story is still keeping him in my lap. Once upon a time I say, I work in Beverly Hills in a house that is very fancy, relays, floors  a checkerboard all morning. And that was first here, the lady she opened. opened the door and saw me and right away she said, you are high. She told me she knew that, on the way I time my sneakars. The lady's husband he had an office and she wanted that to be root too. She hired me extra to go on the Saturday in the straight. He was there working while I clean, and he had one jar  this up to my waist full with pins, and I asked him, did he want me to get two from the bank and he said, you can take the pins. But I could not live. And so I came back Sunday my day off, and I sat on the floor out of this way and put all the panties into tubes. He stepped around me when he went down the hall to use the restroom in the shoes. He asked me how much money it was as he went by, and I'd tell him the totals were far. 36 dollars, good job one. The next time was 92. By the last time he passed, I was at 306. That time his face looked strange, a two-line cross-open. He went down the hall, nine-hurt-zero-opsin. On his way back, he stopped over me and said, maybe you'd better leave with him. Whatever you , he was up to you. When he was back in his office on the phone, I got up and left it all day, and broke his pile of balls. the jar to him, rowing. I took the bus to my sister and I never went back to that house. That was the end of my career, or whatever was known. Is that when you think to me? That is before. You were not yet born, but tough. When the husband took the pennies I wrote to the bank, what they are telling him? They are telling him too, with they are telling us. You cannot help you. And  what he will do then? He shouldn't have taken you, Penny's wand. He is a bad man. I love you, Lucy. what he will do? He will throw the pennies in the garbage and walk away in a room. He is always in pain. Because he is rich. He is too busy, too. Now I am fishing with my arm in the garbage field and I'm wet things for our tubes for one foot on the pool But we will do something else from you watch one I pull him in the way I can out into the right ear We will do five in the county school each place I count up in my hands I put in piles of ten on the counter so it is easy and that's just My father always said, spend your small money first. He remembered in the Philippines when money became torn. The smaller denominations they would not buy anything, and still at that time told him, there's so much wealth. For Carter was in the wagon I am pulling, eating long, orange and green candy worms. I tell him, see? In the bank it's nothing. But, ... here in the world, it is money. Not for the Philippines, but we can still buy it every day a little. It is our own private fund, our trust fund. I trust you, and you trust me. You have your candy.
