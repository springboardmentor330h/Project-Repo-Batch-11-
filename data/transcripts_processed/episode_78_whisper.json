  "text": "Okay, three bones, H13, 15 and 16. Offer each other's work here and take news in this radio program. And the big names they chose, ready? K-Rat, the story res in prayer. The search name is the method of computer hacking and software parsing. That's Mr. Whereas, that's Whereas as in, Whereas, as in software's, as in the legal, private software. Inis, Fred teach it. Why friend? For no reason then. Just gotta be someone else named Fred out there. And then the melody was important given the kinds of things we would discuss. Anyway, better quite far. Peter Hacken. And the nature of hell. Welcome to the BVZ inch, Hago and Public Radio International. It's the American Life on our own class. Each week on our program we choose some theme in English. a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. They are our program. How bad is bad enough to count? Heck one, how bad is stealing $800? Heck two, little radio experiment, well, then the lab codes need protective goggles and her can do the same. Heck three, how bad is this relationship? Heck four, how bad is this movie? Teaching a simple home test that anybody can do to determine if a movie is actually good or actually bad? at five creating your own small code. This area of a teenager would be power to shut down your phone line or anyone else's and how he decided to leave his mouth. So, we're just... ... and how he decided to leave his mouth. So, we're just... ... and how he decided to leave his mouth. So, we're just... ... and how he decided to leave his mouth. So, K-Red, Mr. Warrass, we're trying to be criminals, but they were not supernatural officers... they were... for a hacker's convention. Between sessions I followed them to lunch and McDonald's and Times Square, the first Fred was going to pay from Mr. Whereas and K-Van. That's one. I want to number one meal. But Fred wasn't used to the downtown prices. What's that? It's my butter. You guys are chipping in, I can't pay for this. I think it's safe to say that one sign that the criminal career is not going as well as you might want it to. Is if you have to worry about the prices, I can't go. I'm getting to see what it says. Mr. Whereas in credit we're involved in very low level. Thanks for the comments. Other crimes involved in shootings, they've hired its software, the scam, 3 CD roundings, cheated one of the big online computer services, had a few hundred dollars no online time. On the other, they didn't still very much, and they didn't still very effectively, but stealing was the idea. Here's a typical one in the scam, they called people at random, and tried to get a call and call number or credit card number. Basically the way it works is that you call up somebody. Say this is the AT&T operator. And you have to hold the point if you have to sound, you're not calling somebody up with the intention of getting them. You have to sound  you can sitting in this chair 10 hours, you want to go off. You've got to go. And this is the AT&T operator. Have a click off call, a week's at Charger Sir. Y'all except Charger Sir. Hold on a second. And you tap on the keyboard. Say, I'm sorry. You seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can't accept collect calls of a slide. And then they yell, and they go, what do you mean I can't accept calling all of them? my line. I've been getting good calls in this line for 20 years and then you've got to go out to serve something I can do about it. My computer says you can't receive a collect call on this line. Let's try an alternate filling method. Then I go really mean alternate filling methods. Well you can build it to your calling card or your major credit card which case the other seeds I think you can do calling card or B credit card. And then of course is the idea behind the thing and the calling card number or a credit card number that they can use themselves. And as you may suspect on now there's just one hub in this news. That is... That's more. Reason doesn't work because... It's not obvious we had start yelling and saying, What do you mean you can't build it to my lawn? A lot of bad. It's not right. Then I'll just say, oh, this is too much trouble for getting it. I wanted to have to build it all. The other scams, these guys don't do much better. They tried to hack their way into the mainframe system. They've to cut a retail and put it in the pot and stop. And put it in the pot and put it in the pot. They are such unaccomplished computer hackers that Fred and self was at the same time. Fred and self was at... actually the victim of half what somebody broke into his account and won computer bulletin bulletin then used his account and his electronic mail because some of the nether regions can make you talk to the guy on IRC there's weird guy this guy is going on all the setchills and  he was wrecking my names of awful you can't get this it if I wouldn't get this stuff because that would be entirely hypocritical I've said that if anybody ever steals one of my credit cards or ever in the mic, how the computer system, I will not care, I will be perfectly allowable. , to go and say, I can't believe somebody's going to cry. I was so glad that it's everyone else. I'm perfectly willing to let someone do that. But for the summer it was when they really started its series. Mostly it was what they called, hardy, getting other people's credit card numbers, and then buying stuff on their credit cards. They met this adult new, all about hardy and who showed them some tricks. He read in Fred ordered $1,600 huge emerging dyesons. somebody else's credit card had a delivery to neutral address, picked it up, so it happened stuff for cash, and for rest. The only thing I was peculiar about this story is that these are rich kids. K-rated Fred lived in a wealthy estate community, and he was in one of his sensitive prestigious private schools in the country. But he stayed. Fred believes he has no choice. Wanted to get all the things the other kids in private school had. I might be way stereo. Just wanted to do the same as everybody else. Skinny Young. looking 15, he is perpetual step-of-cash. He said his parents could not help him much with money right now because they're just going to half million dollars in debt on the house. At one point, to get some cash, and so the computer, his parents could have been for school. But every time I knew, he wanted to replace the computers for this possible with the help of his students credit card. I'm also pretty good at shopping, but my whole thing on that is that I will not do anything if I have credit for it. Because, , and a lot of times, , so... my school,  the girl,  I see up from that a lot, but  I also  give a ton of dollars for no reason to have clinic,  I feel bad about what I score, and  if I ever get the money so I don't have to give any more, then I'm not gonna do it. It's most striking about this, it's how Fred and the other boys think, really want to convince themselves that they are good, and they really do not harm anybody. Or if it does harm someone, there's the reassuring thought that someday somehow, They might make it up to the injury. As noble as the sounds, if I ever, this one thing that I absolutely guarantee that sounds the biggest load of crap, anyone could ever say it, but if I am ever, I'm really good inside. If I ever find myself, and I've made this about it myself, and a good enough financial situation, I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making two million dollars a year, I will send a $10,000 check company which I saw, , calling. calling cards for them or  I that is something I definitely want to do if I didn't try to do it. K-Bad released the $600 they charged with strangers' visa by the Zittimus crime. The credit card owner would call B-Set and have charged remove from this bill. The visa figures are certain men and frauds just the cost of doing the business. One thing that I've always said in all of my doing is that I will never ever do something that will severely hurt the individual versus. Okay so for example if it involves I would never move someone I would never. beats and we're not for money. I'd never shop with. Well, maybe I'd know I wouldn't shop because that's hurting. That is hurting. You're worth it. I'm just gonna stop the tape right here. This is just this amazing moment that I got captured on tape. He's struggling over this so much that you could actually hear him figure out his position on this. As he speaks. Let me put. I'd never shop with. Well, maybe I'd know I wouldn't shop because that's hurting. That is hurting. You're worth it. You're worth it. We had a lot of them down on some back to our town when we figured out how to spend some energy used to come to place. But then any compting from me, grid-stitch, talking to you again about this mission, it was only still in this absolute pump. , I go to boarding school and I don't have that much , I got to have any money or anything, , and I get  really hungry and stuff, I have a fast metabolism, and  I'm  seriously, I start and I lost  10 pounds per week. That's not good for someone who's really skinny  I am so and then a lot of it is you stop I want And yeah, it's just really want to stress We're not that we're not  in other ways we're not that people we don't  go around High and screw up people in anyway, we can't because we're not at all. I mean I do social work. I   a tutor case. I  do a lot of stuff with you Let's show you You've more good, but sometimes, I don't know, man. I  doing it. I can't explain it. Talk about that part of it. What is this real up to? That's the first, that was the reason I started cutting. The reason is the thrill of going, when in there was real cut. It was  mission impossible. We went in, we had gloves on and stuff, and we picked it up. We had all worked out. We connect people, we had , look out some stuff. And it's just a lot of fun. It's , , you're doing stuff that it's not exactly going to not be with all and it's fun. But this point we were back in our talk lobby, was to be at the latest in the Hackers convention. Carrots said that real hackers don't do it when you've been done. Real hackers don't use your skills personal game, but it's still panic hard in the years. You don't need fraud people. Real hackers is it. Breaking computers just to see. You've been through a corner the hallway, wouldn't you? it wouldn't be a third by the three of us. Here I said that they never really talked to me that we really quite confused each other. The most thing I'm worried about is I'm actually starting the first time to say this all out loud, everything I've done and suddenly it doesn't sound it's just accurate much anymore. And I've known that every time we're working doing this, it's clearly quite good. That's why I'm exactly considering giving up on all the parties, which is quite serious. Great chat time of work. You're serious, and you did. would never get in the future. I don't  computer. I don't  computer. I  computer. I'm going to get a gun and shit. I'm not after your computer. I think that bad conscience is that it's switching out. Precidity and two different notes. To the notes. Sometimes you would think that what you can do. And you can't. Mostly. It's  that. I just want to do it with that. and the rest of the time we get to that you got in my heroes, Paramount, my face, my face. I want to come to think about it. I want to make an end up going to help you. So, my face is here. You're just not? Yeah. I do. You think you're going to help with any good arts skills? I don't know. I hope not. Really, I always do my biggest career. Please be also on a great time. , great approach. There's something up on. It's , strong, the camera was back, that's really pretty good. How big is this story, , with this, with this key of the night? Yeah, I mean for a couple minutes, and then I just  sort of put it up on my mind, yeah. This share of the crying process is deepened down. I told him the permanent adults were simply, did not seem  a lot of money. But I think the day, the turning day helped, just leaving the box. And as soon as I saw this, I thought, for a tiny moment, it's just some, this moment. It was  a song, singing, singing, it's a big, great, that's not so small. And , music and that quiet, let me just do. Then Mr. Whereas, forgot. Said that maybe by a box, this was a name. There, it's a box. It was a tiny one. When is telepathy? Maybe he's not. He's not. He's not. a Indian But that a lot of people who are going to hell and man, for because they sold a lot of people. Now don't care who goes for hell. People go to hell for not doing. That will as doing. He used to say when I was hungry. giving me no meat. When I was naked, didn't give in to old, and these shall go away whenever has this punishment. Oh, guys, I was hungry to help. Oh, people, I'm not going to help. Oh, God, I'm hungry to help. It's a drop of time to go to hell. It's a man that's sold in a drink room. They are all eaten on it. It wasn't money. They were a pile of drinks. They were tiring all hands. I'm going to go to the gate of the gate. Active, go to the gate of the gate. This time we tried a little radio experiment.

I mean, what am I doing here? Why are these strange people? I don't remember deciding to come to Italy. What am I doing in Italy? You'll see, but just ... It was in France, in Ruarn, the town where Joan Barrett was under the state. And I was visiting the tower where she was held before her execution. And I was thinking about writing a letter, , apologizing. A letter apologizing to the injured person. I was looking down from the highest room in Ruarn, and just how you do it. , you try to tap into the place in yourself where you're truly apologizing to the communities. Because you want to be sincere. You want to write some funny. It was such a beautiful life. I discovered that there was no such place in the south. Where that place should have been. There was just an empty room. They hit this right. People  the steering need to be this. Let's see the Pope. Ask for absolution. But you have to be repentant. And that repentant. You can just act repent. Ask for rituals all about. Do we clear emotions now? I definitely started my heart. I can't just pretend to have her more. You need to even try. I mean, the purpose of very near sight of distracted old men. Very good face in your hands, pretended to sob and sherry buy. It's not a question of food in your pulp. I'm starting to think you don't really want to help yourself. What do you get? Why are we playing pulp in Italy? The demonic little boy who's grandmother is dying in your experience. What was that? What? What? What? What was that? What? What? Bigger. Huh, is that a symbol? Right. Look, there it is, near the center. Ahhhh! It's cold. But cold in people can be in the drain. They want to be in this. My advice, that you can look at the most positive interpretation. Let's go. We're out in danger. I can only offer you a book. Ah, well, that's all right. Alright, can't pull me. Look at you. what? You need to look at the special measure. Look at this mess. Oh, loving, loving, loving, you've got a positive straight question. Excuse me. I mentioned onion side, my grandfather was killed by a touch. No, I'm sorry, talking is shit, tell me. Two million. Another go to pick up is written by Jack George James. I think I remember this, it started by John. chapter ten as a new play using his cut off I just want people I don't want people now I want them now I want people now I want people I want people now I want people now I want people now I want people now I want people I agree how bad is this relationship? Well, most of us probably didn't have some relationships. We're a party point and we just had to go and see our ear or the things we're doing and this is what they are not doing. Is this... it's a better one. Is it better? Now on dates, on dates and on well, we need some return, we want to set this thing up and do it. Just as one, just as one. Just as one. Just as one. This experience is so common. Walk up to some foreign street. I should have known. relationship was doomed when on the first date he did order an amazing bottle of wine so I was excited about that then when it got time to start with appetizers he ordered the Aspergasse and shrones and that's when I found out that he couldn't just talk  a normal person everything aspergasse despairous Shrooms was my shrooms He was never at home he was at his house he ended up And if you wanted to go get a drink it would be a cocktail Not said, I think. Well, I was on a date and I was went to dinner and me and the screw-art talking over dinner. And she asked me how my family was. I said that my elder sister was married and just had a kid. And then I mentioned that, , , my parents were just weren't getting along too well. Because she didn't get the kid baptized in. And then she said, what? Well, why not? She doesn't, you're so surrealized that your kid is going to burn in the fires of hell. If she hasn't got her kid baptized, and that kind of told me that maybe this is it going to work out too well. How many things? Every bother me is when every time you go on in dates, and at the end of the day she asks, now you pay it for it. And I sit. So I'm sitting, so we're sitting in fire, and we're having drinks, blah blah blah blah blah. I'm just going to reach out. there says, be what do you do? They asked me what I did before I have my job now. And I said, oh, well, , I worked in Berkeley. I worked at one of these kind of lefty research institutes and I wrote paper to them. And he's , lefty, you mean left handed? And I was , check. Talking very much. So large! lot of conversation and you not involved. , a lot of their life story. You didn't ask. Grab me so much conversation with and just be , it's  the Charlie Brown. , it's just two point it just gets a mom. What did you say? Oh, mom, mom, mom, you basically. That's it. The sky calls and he comes to pick me up. He was very nice. I have to say I told him that I didn't know anything about Cincinnati and , brought this architectural guide. We drove around and showed me all of these historic landmark buildings that were very beautiful. And then he started driving around in these other neighborhoods and saying, well, I used to own that building. But I sold it. And I didn't really know what to say. I mean, you're on a first date with someone you don't really want to find out about  their landholding. So I just sort of was polite nodding. And we were driving around. And he points out another building. Oh, we are now. one and oh now we on this and over here in one of them we're  substandard housing. And then we  drove by this other apartment complex and he said yeah we had to put someone out of their apartment map building on Christmas Eve it was terrible and I realized he was a sublord. We sit down to eat and because of the way my kitchen is we are eating and the living room because of the living room is re-entformed and eating eating everything's going fine I think And midway through dinner, she drops her fork on her plate, it's clank. And I look up and I'm wondering if something's gone wrong and she says, why haven't you kissed me yet? So I kiss. And kiss kiss kiss. And the kissing is going fine. There's no calm with kissing. Ten minutes into the kissing. Again, pulls back, starts to cry. Don't you think? It's sad that everyone else can fall in love with people  us just chill. Well, what do you do at that point? Well, in this program which we asked question, how bad it's not enough to count. We offer things. It's not so serious to be thinking about the word. We disagree about movies. So, maybe we'll just really work in the end. The entire question of movies is just right for how bad it's not enough to count. So many movies seem to straddle or even obliterate one from being bad. We are to better guide with a simple portable system to provide from the chat. This test was invented by One, Howard, Redbenewoods, Syvitz's stuff, not professional movie predict. He says the determined weather and movie is in fact good. Simply hope he asks the question, Is it better or worse than the truth about catcher dogs? Survive eye contact, truth about catch dogs, kind of absolute midpoint. That is the midpoint between good and bad, great and unwatchable. The truth about catch and dodge may recall is the mediocre romantic comedy, but may forget about Zombie닝,'Nygrapnel and Steam Deck realise, good in the firm is bad and it does is in robustness. It stands at the crossroads. It stands at the dividing line and it is used. It is a typical movie going night for how original screen is going. So it's facing me. Which a lot of people have liked how circuit is things about and we definitely agree that it is pale, transparent, which is  a clock which doesn't really both well. It needs to run a couple of hours of recent news by you. to help you read the feedback and to know the smell. Ellie confidential. You see it? I am. I am. I can definitely read above above the truth about cancer dogs lying. Far above? Well, it might be helpful to say, , truth about cancer dogs is the midpoint. Right. And there's a tier of about them and I don't want to get too specific to say, 371% of the rustler moving from it. are in that realm of good, pretty good to good, to very good. I'd say it's called at Shell. It does stuff time above and gives great. Another interesting thing to me, men. I would have to protect you now. Just slightly above, but yeah, that's unfortunately. Yeah, I'm afraid. I have one actually, I have also heard. Friends, you're ready here first. Things that can make our lives easier. The metric system, Esperanto, which we've got cats and dogs. We're coming up. One man's Wild Wild West. Happily. and the special problems and does absolutely power corrupt absolutely. It's in a minute. Public Radio International, Wayne Art Program continues. This is American life, my request and treatment of drug news courses is Dean and you can write it in different kinds of stories and stories and today's problem. How old is that now? It's the whole story that I'd  to just make the case in the tablets. We special burden when it comes to this hospital. How am I taught these? I was ... out how caustians can go sachet through vise not really wanting to know whether something is in the movie for Tixin or not. This is Jim Nelson who was raised outside Washington DC in the late 18th of the Madden Company school for boys. Will he remember many discussions in which in class difference between big sins and little sins? 11th grade prison boy he did surprisingly ambiguous discussion. that were how bad this masturbation. Church doctor, he was telling me, said, it was a cardinal sin. We need to go to health and act. But the leading church, just to do so, was much more than half. Current deal, he said, it was just a denuous and meaning, bad, great bad of course, but you won't actually go to health. The ambiguity drove Jim crazy, which was, which was, he says, which has had to know. He could still get worked up over it. And if it isn't a cardinal sin in their... Nobody, none of the priests believe that it is a carnal sin, then what's up, take the records? Hear me? Yeah, let's get everything in order. What's the get everything in order? Let's be on the same page. Let's get organized here, otherwise. It's not good. Looking back, what do you make of the entire endeavor? Trying to define, well, here's the line. Here's the line. Let's get it. Get it in order. I think it still sticks with me. That's the hard part, not real. Yeah. And this is the best thing in his sense. So I don't know why I'm going to be practicing. He know why I'm going to be in heaven and hell. He still points up as, how bad is this? Cardinal soon? Venus soon? Is this bad, man? For instance, just , Athens may have joined. Big Santa Verus. not responding to EMA in 20th Route. Little senseless, but big enough that he lies to the people who write him in the court, which of course is a big sin, but he figures not as big and not as bad as hurting people's feelings by an upspotting quickly. EMA is the whole attorney phone calls thing. Turning them right away. You don't return them right away. Is that the scene? Oh yeah, totally. It's more  you're just screaming phone calls on your computer because you worry that you might. be sinning by screening phone calls? Well, because when somebody calls you, I feel  it's an honesty thing that you're there, you should pick up. And I lately have been having my name and I've just just screwed phone calls. And so it's a little bit of a more pond reform. I talked to everyone with a couple of friends who suggested a compromise. What did you compromise? To turn the volume down. That's what I  to hear. So I don't know who's calling me. I'm actually not the forced to decide what I should and from God. So I'm that piece of my self-care. Jim Nelson in the old something. See Red Power. As born. It can be an investment in this case. What do you think? I don't need anything to say about God. I'm ready to find a Word Inside. I can talk to him and other friends because my person loves to ask why I do this. Can you avoid that or have a word? I have to say I have fun. There's a bit of experience. I'll just do it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Oh yeah, we're all good. I don't think I'll suggest anybody else to... I'll do anything with you. That's it. That's it. But we started today's project with three inspiring computer hackers in the world of tell. This is the story of the accomplished project. It's not. Starting in the 1980s, we liked to remember the three computer hoppers called Dream Home Deal. In the crew and online, we liked to learn as acid-free, that's the great, the ancient part of the world. Journalists from the village boys and S. Guyermanz, and I think just how much смотреть traveler looking forward to our current movie with great fusion. no group of Americans have to score or since, as they've gotten the score and we can get into the school's. They infiltrated dozens of businesses and government members. At one point, the, and the coalition S4RF into demonstrators, and also for a breaking fighthouse, and then they watch them do. The demo to this real love is not actually breaking into stuff or breaking White House. They love trying to figure out Biggest must facilitate a comorbidity continue to implement. which is the phone system. They hacked away the highest love computers run from this from North meaning they had the power to sign any services to the phone. This in the phone, this neck created comes, get on with something. What? Bring the whole phone system down. Eli served six months in the minimum security prison and six months in front of the time.

So, bye bye. water and he taught me about real estate, which in the coming days said, I learned real estate from real Malin about start,  I learned from the best estate, but such real estate seems to be a powerful. The attitude there was that of Rada, everybody there had had something in common that was the link for the show's great past month, she wanted to achieve. got at some point in the just stroke apartments. There are no losers there, I'm sure. Everybody there had that. That achieve a very high level of success, very low moon level of good. And I had power strength on the most of the year. with a particular list that is asked in New York, New York, New York, New York. every just in class, because I was really happy when I was a time pal. As you only have her,  I got a lot, Java. Every people, , I've seen credit cards, which I really credit to. The change you put is a big thing because I, I don't know if  that, but at the time, you got a list o that wasВОATOSTE TO experience, when we have to. to use one thing, because they have to choose them. That it passes. It takes six, just to do it. It's passable. That is what obstacles one. Set it, and allow it to then be detected. Please, exactly. Then we will pass the direction to that wheel. Then again, we will ask you then, what's the Italian? I was just a little question that's hard to answer. I didn't find any. This is my room. See, it's... It's  a TV as you go. Wow. Sort of. The better thing we looked in during his six month home from time is time. Fair enough space from bed, the desk and workshop. This TV is in this room. 2 computers. Let's put this in. Hello. I just got kind of a lot of cool memories. I've got back to my room. I've got five phone lines. I got two light phones, but I've got everything else to make. The next few days are fast. I've got three motor and flying around. a few days always on. They were cheesy, fun for movies and videos. Only  CD-Crier, old school rap, I'm actually also a ghost, Jimmy Hendrix. Finally he said, let me show you. and put that zero out, called spiral numbers. Where we're seasonal, but I have to be turned back. Right at this exam mission report, and you may see, so this subject has to be. These notes are, this is the broad system's point. But, well, let's sketch these diagrams, how these are, which is called Cosmo Hurt's definitions. So, what is that? You really get all stuff outside the country? That's it? Something different. W. You Donald, since I had telling it, I had Donald's pants. If you were on a towel, then probably that razor. So, I really get all, , $15,000, and she has sex sex. So, you said to prevent, how someone else. You can't even, as one can know how. You can just pay from if you have a run for it. Getting to appear is liberate one from liberating me. Make so that you don't need quarters without pay. Just get the tile out of it. So that we can make on this one from first one. Next step is to get into the network. Find a session that was already. It's going and then knock them off. Flatter the next and then sit there watch. In other words, put us in their place in the place where they're in connect. So next time they try to log in, we'll get our computer and we type in log, and they put in their log in turn. And we go past it. , past it. So, past it. But past it. No, we have, , all these things are already coding one teeth, so we just want to. And yeah, we'll never go back. Log, you're a part of the passive passive. Then we'd say, log in and correct them. This connect from them, but we already got the log in and password. And then when they're reconnected, it would be the records. So they figured, hey, we're going to mistake typing it in. And that's how we get in the top. That's it. It's fun. Yeah. You get into things that are great, start targeting systems that are interesting. We started developing the collections  these four cards. I have NASA, I have NSA. I've got home company computers, I've got my ZAR, I've got thousands. I've got this, I've got that. I've got a lot of dollars. Now , two are going to see VI changing even. What else can I get, ? You try to hit big names. , so you started developing the collection. Gomarksки while you came to a look or team. You Let's look up John Goddy's credit. Now let's see what he owns. Let's look up Julia Roberts. Let's get a home phone and let's get this concept done. Let's take a look up Julia Roberts. We're talking about trying to take on your credit and do what we have to do and we really could. That's what we're going to do. I felt  it was  mission passed. That's what we did. and then we'll all go out. Hook up and everything is , yeah, all right. I'm not black guys. She does all this stuff. I can get into it. And let's go. Let's go. I felt  we should have lucky talk, he's in head sets and everything. You're , okay, I blew. Go do your thing on five. Ready five, four, three, you're in. You're in. There's just an amazing after a while. And we're just so excited. We're getting all that stuff. We're just rushing. flow. , let's just start going. You can't stop. , you just do rolling one after the other. The flow that's going and then we're just , yeah, we're real. , we're it. Did anything it's striking how little did it be? It's power. There's music pranks. Making you to the!, it's something called... happening, turning an enemy's home phone line into the T-Fong on, so that when you to keep up the phone phone, it can enemy in a thousand quarter reach. The recipient of that duty consists of regular phones, this is home phone. They did cultural irreverberate points, they caught criminalism too. But there's an emptiness at the heart of our own experience. Once you've got to be moved on the phone, she's , no, no, no, she's talking to us. I was , how are you going to say? Hi, we're calling for the United States. This guy, he's in the USA. He's okay. Hello. And she said goodbye, ? ? what you say? What do you say to the Queen Elizabeth? ? Ah, so she got movie, he writes it. what you say? what you say? The fun of it is fun, ? He had a strong prison program to remind me of this. It's  this. Some of the members were broken to do this. It's a very famous happens. It's a very small prison. He had a name. It's a member of the systems. This is a really weird reason. But a little bit of a reason, a lot. He did nothing. That's a thing that could have been. But what we did was such small, such a large excuse. I'm not hungry. ... Oh... Tell me,yy because if he really does it at the end of the game... he'll undergo it, does he? Don't show your feelings about the game or culture, And tell him how to play a drum music, that is, I'm gonna say, this is why I never had no other goal in the games, but, for... Inside Hollywoodstock Ar Spanish, So when the applications for this kind of stuff, what happened? We were , oh, maybe we just came to this. I don't know what time it was for me, for me, that my mom and I see. Please look at this. Please look at this. I think this is a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good stress. It's a good thing. It's  passing. It's  making fun of a laugh at him. It's a good thing. Yeah, it's a little cure on the room. He's got so mad at us. And he's the key caller and spirit louder. And then one day, he's going to take him. die, but the day after me the call, the past, he passed away. And where they're , yo, we kill him. I hope not. Then they said, well, it's great down this low, oh my god. Oh my god, he can chill with this. What am I telling? He's very, very nice to meet you. Keep cutting, but it's very slow. I don't destroy the virus and it's really delicious. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can do it. It's a small discussion. I'm thinking about the good of us still wrote in Hackings. So people in this world are still running across the equation, we know rules, but I'm trying to count. In a situation we've had to do a long long long long. You guys could have a sound particularly. For example, I  most songs. This group can not share its information, but other songs. We have to control over certain things. We can have them, necessarily, one of them, and they're the host's house. But you don't stay there. Don't let it get out of the top groups. It's all nonsense. They don't know how to use it. They don't understand how they're going to be interested in each house. This is the moment. This is the moment. That's the wild west. Take the time yourself to have a gun. Responsible for it. You did that to someone. You're responsible for that. So you don't do that. You want to shoot somebody's sister. You said that he's white for something. , that's the point. , it's all a question from around. So we promise, when it's debate on civil rights, we forever do. I'm everything. Of course. Yeah. Those times. And those times, and these times, usually partially affected, you can make decisions We got friends with the doctor, we can tell him about the secret. We talked to my doctor, which was right here. That was him. The fact when I was visiting you right, we was facing a daily question for you. We think it was something defining. The prison system monitored us movements with the electronic device, which is ready to be traveled. the device sent signals to a computer that is worried about and that computer called another computer that is worried for actions used to phone on the bed. Hacking some computers couldn't respond, it was clear how to do it. Well, he got you something. He was going straight. How did this happen? He was wrong. And how did this he was scared to get in part? He was just kind. He got a list of this. He was in the mountains. He was down to the point. such a lot of golden memories oh maybe we gotta be listening. Ah there's another thing we gotta do when we're just that's about hundreds of pages of planets. Now you're finally learning that such a rush to get when you initially get a timer or if it's just before it. Here in Chicago, a popular popular famous big speakers coming to some of these things. We're putting again, not because they thought it was wrong to be in it. It was the last one I'd been asking up with you. They were putting it because they were just tired of having the same night. Oh no, hang on, I'm the sweet. Seems the same people doing the same stuff. That's been by being there, even though I talked about it. It gets warm. I just burned myself out. I just got to that point. Everybody gets burned out, they have to treat me. Today, three years after that interview, Elias Manager of Information Security on Wall Street.
