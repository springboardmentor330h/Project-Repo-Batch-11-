  "text": "WB EZI Chicago and Public Radio International, it's the American Library of Wales. But certainly it begins in 1865, and ends this year. Today, the moment in 1965 we started as a march forward, the Abraham Lincoln delivered the second inaugural address. I don't know if you ever read this speech, but it's just incredible about me. Just poor paragraph saw. It's time to deal with this civil war was ending. Over a half million Americans did. And it didn't use the speech, 100 the question. Why? I have been visited with the sport. Here is words. Either party expected to the war, the magnitude of the duration, which had already each looked for an easier time. There was so a less fundamental understanding. Both read the same Bible and created the same God and each in books is eight against the other. The Almighty, as it all proves. And at this point in the speech, it could possibly be an incredible image. It's , There is kind of original sins on it. An original sin for which all Americans say, says, Finally do we hope, perfectly do we pray that this mighty scorched war misledly passed away? Yet a God wills it continue to all the wealth power by the bonds means 250 years of unruquated toil shall be sung. In total every drop of blood drum, the lash, shall be paid with another drum, the sword. As we said, 3000 musler, says there must be some. Yet it's the work, it's the work that I just saw. Now let's go into the charity brawl. Promising the right of the sky, just to see the right. Let's strive on just the work. Find the finished ones. Here, I'm sure going battle. Bruse with Elinswood. Do all which may achieve and cherish just the last ones. Among ourselves, Monkeys. Let's go to the charity brawl. Let's go to the charity brawl. Go to the charity brawl. And this is where the joy we can erase this question. How are we doing? Observing ourselves for our original sound. Can't hear that. I'm talking now. I don't talk  this when I'm around my friends. I mean, it's just, , when I go to school, this, it goes to school,  this everyone is speaking. And  this, so, , I have to do my best to be in bed. Which I... I kinda do pretty good. Layed off, . I pretty much have everybody grown off, but they, they pretty much know nothing of where I come from. This is Zelia, Miller. Whenever quoted this, he was a sophomore at the Chicago High School, named very familiar. Thinking part, in the rich neighborhood, Chicago is mostly white, but side. Helianbe was the bus for nearly an hour a day to get this home. In the neighborhood, Chicago is mostly flat. This is saturdaygeady. it's outside. When measure of how far we have to go,  what it was. It's distance area at the go. To the public school. It is hard on the person. , to come to Lincoln Park and your friends, they have, they have, , fifty dollars in change, , and then solve and they have these expensive things. Then you go home and you're slapping the face by reality. That's... That's why I spend so much time on the school. I hate to go home. As for me, my whole life I have to take pictures. Now, until this year, I've been totally free of all of this. It's just got to the point where I can't hold it back. This is Chris. Senior at Lake Park, here I am. Man, this is biggest experiment. He's created schools, left Chris intolerant, mostly because of pencil interactions, and I have all the time, blacksmiths. Some of them were his followers said, some of them are dissimed, some of them were dissimed, and I was trying to go out of a door that someone was standing halfway and halfway out and say, excuse me. And so I went through, guys, those boys knew it's good to be this one. That's right, yeah. So he started saying that he was keeping walking  a teacher at this business I just stopped and said excuse me Said you heard me And you just seem to want to get into it I just  basically blew it off and And they continued I went to class I came out a whole bunch of people surrounded me this one is the one and I'm just standing there  what and then one of them said Yeah, I can call the student, we're during all this and I said, hold it, I didn't say any of that. It seems at one point the whites were at a higher level, blacks as far as socialistic. Now, rather than the equal, I think in the blacks mind, I'm speaking, the blacks mind, blacks which higher the whites. band together, knocking something else. Still, there's a lot of resending from that 50-60 slavery, whatever it's times. We get to the street, how long it is. As far as slavery, how long did that come for? How long did it take before it ended? So how long can you take the Pro Black Sunlights to meet along as well as Black Sunlights Black Sunlights do? Well today in our program, 4 attempts at answering that question. Back one, another politician, Scott and Edward Black. Back two, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. Back three, good blacks and bad blacks, the story by New York, right around the you outside well attracted. racial cheerwaters. It's very best somebody who's added to the bad race ditching. Stay with us. Heck one, a modern politician, his god and better than my god. When I long ago, the governor of southern state in the zone of time, finding a position to learn to achieve the last piece of honor ourselves. Frankly, it has not gone to the well-born. Governor was David D's Leaves up here right now. status could place to examine how well-plumed the support  is the only state in the union applies better in the lab for its state house. Our contributing editor Jack here is from South Carolina and this past thanks getting who watched the television address for Governor David B.C. composer Dave removed the plot from the state house five. The governor of the state is a Christian coalition camp, a few works to one high office in amendment 1946. So abyssey. . took control of the governor's mansion and not long after that a number of different things happened. Churches were burned. There were some drive-by shootings, both blacks and whites by people of the other race and tensions got very very high. And basically, it is a good decent man actually. One of the things that I've tried to explain to people when I'm written about it was that it's to stake to think that everybody's Christian coalition is You can play along, I beat you! slick, media wise, focused group opinion age, , washing, laundry, and stuff. It won't point out that I'm going to be able to spread throughout the week as being sincerity challenged. Yeah, haha. And the irony of that is that most of the people that I know in the Christian coalition in South Carolina, in fact, deeply sentimental about the efforts to bring equality to the sexist and the whole, , civil rights effort. And in a funny way, this is... This is going to be beastly downfall because what he did after these very shooting that I survived was beside that the Christian thing to do was to take down the Confederate flag from the statehouse. In other words, it actually was a change of part and there was not much political advantage in it for him, he stood to gain student at gain politically from this move. I have asked everyone I know exactly what would be political advantage cover of public bringing down flag. There's no. I mean, it might be one of the few cases in America while I'll be right now, where when the politician said, I went and I prayed and I decided to take him this one, that that is the fact that I'm... I'm not good for him. So, I mean, he wins no points in his own part. It'll be so confident of him. I'm sure he can throw that ball. Because of his standing. Because of his eyes. Let's... So he comes on television. He comes on television. What was really, I'm sitting there with my entire family. We were all watching. And everybody just needs to clip watching. It's on all the channels that have been talked about in the papers today. So we're going to have to stay. And his two, , the two rebuttal arguments put forward our mind, all the Republicans, no Democrats, no black persons. And the other TV was spoke. when MacDonald and local state of some Charles and Charles Constantial. I'm clearly happy to rise on your special talk. What was amazing about these these arguments predicted and crime that's argued for keeping it up is that they both missed the stake out rather nuanced positions about the meaning of symbols and contemporary American culture. I mean, strange as I sat there, listen to the governor talking about how many works, ? And as , there is an entire academic discipline devoted to how these interpret songs. Right, and this is the field of Khodsemia, the seminar. Sort of a very, , our keen in a certain way, academic discipline, which has swept across that it needs to have to be the last 15 years. Right. Right. We're not the kind of thing which it keeps. years in our American political debate. Not very often. In fact, you've written about this. I'm going to read from your read and you say, the speech themselves were novel for the departure from the debates, oh terms, flag example, flag is not equal. Rather, the speakers put forward nuance arguments of semiotics, the science of symbols. And I don't mean they argued flag debate signified other issues beyond race. No, I meant they were actually arguing semiotic theory. Yeah, so let me just read you, Lee. This is this is bee's lead talking. He says explaining why we should take the five men on. He says you see this is a quote. You see the Confederate flag flying above the statehouse flies in a vacuum. It's meaning and purpose are not defined by law. Because of this, any group can give the flag any meaning and chooses. The clan can use it as a racist tool as it has. And others can use it so as a symbol for racism as they have. And so he's basically articulating what is the central. it of modern semi-outed theory, which is that you have this object of cloud and any meaning can attach to it. Right, and then what was amazing is that other people who were refuting or were biting, basically delved into the same time here. For example, here's Glenn McConnell, states center of control, talking about the lines, is quote, we are told this fine wax that this should must be removed to be fine. The flag was defined years ago on a monument on the statehouse ground, says that in the hopelessness of the hospitals, the despair of defeat, short, sharp, agonized struggle. These South-Fillanes are usually called a mistake, and so, in consolation, belief that the viewer had held, they would not be forgotten. In other words, the flag has a meaning, and that meaning is stable. That means the state. No, it's a flag means honor. It's always going to mean honor. Other people can fed it attached, but they want to still mean that. And it doesn't do it good. It's a very sh... strong point of view of the Senate, especially in the Senate and the other. And this is what I'm saying, and I think these are the sort of wound cell thing. what in the things that are kind of interesting about this anxiety, the second inaugural, is that the second inaugural is essentially a Christian doctor. I mean, it's both a political document and it's a document arguing about faith. What do we to make of this as people who believe in God? The fact that the war happened it's... many people have died. And it's interesting that these would also basically come to this conclusion that we need to heal, the same conclusion that Lincoln comes to as an act of faith. Right. Well, , I mean, I understand his, he came very close to pulling it off. , if you appeal to the Christian sentimentality, it's not going on for good reasons. You have enormous support. Because , most... these people they don't want this, and they don't want you to have these reasons. , privately, and this goes right to the heart of, I think, not just the sounds, but the Americans and the US Congress, which is the same heart that can be very weeping settlement about the global Black churches can also be seried with, , Black leaders talking about how we can work for. So, Jack, I know that you have your modest proposal on how honest. Oh, you've cut it with flag flying at the statehouse. Might be able to actually get the flag off the statehouse. Well, yes, I do. And if the impact is based on semi-automatic theory. It is based on semi-automatic. I think the remedy would be for blacks and sapial added to start flying the confederate fly. I doubt the stars and bars and bars as the symbol of the new statehouse. Oh, the new statehouse. And our culture, especially where signs and symbols can turn over so quickly, right? It's very easy to do what none of these guys on television were proposing, which is at even warming. That's the only way you can actually alter a symbols view. You never gonna, even if you took the flag, it's power over me. It's power where there was an windshield or somebody's front-long, still remain. I've found an odd world just bowl. I've found an odd world just bowl. I've found an odd world just bowl. I've found an odd world just bowl. That's good! That's kind of most of us can ever see this搞-行了. I would love to see baseball caps with Malcolm X, X's, sort of rejiggered into the stars as far as the Federation or the Confederate flag washed with a little, , African liberation pillars and only blacks in Southern Illinois, awesome. Right, it's our South too. And my further prediction is that if this did blacks, did start wearing it on the t-shirts and on their cars and on their, , on their coats flying in the front of the that the first group to rush to the state capo and insist that the stars and barred love would be the daughters of the better better. So great. I mean but in a certain way I look at the distance of  a century and a quarter after Lanker. How will we do this this part then? I don't know, I mean on the one hand it seems to me so many of the truly meaningful acts of integration of these things. In a way it's the kind of fight that all the other members in the river are almost little and bad when they're there. But I have to say it, I mean, , there's another way to go. And that is the fact that this is what's being made about our situation. It's a place of violence, I mean. I mean if this was being debated, I mean there are all these other things that we have not saw, which are never discussed with the server and political heat. I mean the government or South Carolina is going to use this this this government ship over this symbolic question of whether the plant flag he is not losing this government ship of a weather black children are educated as well as white children. That's true. That's not true. Check hits a magazine writer and you can get it over here this night after he published his idea, the Blacks adopted the stars and bars. You discovered the two Black entrepreneurs in South Carolina have a company called New South that's trying to do exactly that. These two guys, Sherman Evans and Angel Pintera have a full line of clothing that suits you to Confederate flag rendered in the covers of African liberation, Red Black and Green. They've destroyed Main Street, Main Street and downtown Charleston, they have toots. and all 13 original colleges. Realistically, we all noticed those better flags and they get to make it happen. It creates a new thought flag, kind of a hack to remove. And which, , we figured , if the oppressors were things solved, we'd take that, you'd wear it with pride. It's kind of  a strategy whereby you go right into the fear thing to be claimed. Do they have a website? Well, of course, www.newsouthspeltNUSOUTH.com. Chinandard is a woman, she knows... but her child, no one's single. oh! I close my ear. Isn't it long as you breathe. Oh, tell my aunt. It turns into that word. It turns into that word. When you trying каждый text suing... all wanted to prevent it from eroding. If you succeed to have noれない policies, if to don't interrupt your centralized activities. entered ... or a big sugar. Back to Nelson Mandela, neighborhood. What did you do with the symbols of what's comes to the symbols? Well, after the Civil War, neighborhood may not be in the dark, but there's some national capital. Instead, you had to play it on the White House side, saying that the United States, who are our women, the sums of ours. It's a strategy I think Nelson Mandela would have to stand. Thank you, everyone! I think it's story about me and Jack hit story about South Carolina. It reminded me of the story that I had been told by a friend of my name John Madison. John is from South Africa, during a part-time period he was the chief political correspondent in leading up the Chinese grand Daily Mail. For a while he was national public radio correspondent in South Africa, so I know him. When Nelson Mandela was released from prison, John was the reporter given the honor of the first question that his first press conference. Now is members of the Mandela government. And a few years ago he told me about the Springbox. The Springbox or a Rugby T. Under a Cartide Rugby was the favorite game of South App. White's and the Black's favorite game of National Games. Sock, White's is rugby. And the Springbox with a national team, team that would go to the International Competition since I've had. And it was all white or almost all white with one or two black players. Springbox was seen. It's a symbol. White, South App, and the Cartide. When Nesamendel is party, the National Congress, there was this big debate, whether to get rid of the team's name and slow-go springbugs  a deer. And just  the private debate in South Carolina, John Madison says, the debate got very emotional. I would have to say that most people in the ANC can't, I would have argued strongly that the springbugs cannot be written. It's too toxic as a symbol. We've had a big remote place in South Carolina, so we're going to move. discussion about alternatives. And the plan was that the decision was going to be taken after the world cup. During a part-time international sanctions, it kept that that began out of the world cup. And so at the first world cup game, first part-time era, you can post it by South Africa, Nelson Mandela settled this issue, Springback Simball, once and for Mandela walked out on South Africa very springback. with a number six which is the same number as the captain. We walked out into the middle of the fields and we just reached them well and cheered them. The crowd just awoke and we wore a stringback cap as well. I meant at the end of the day, saw that one and walked out onto the field and had the hugged me and the captain of the wing team. So you had the jersey number six, huggy jersey number six. There were two captains of it. kept him in the web meeting and kept him in a cell phone. And remember, right, that when it happened, he told me that they'd run that way. Oh, yeah, it was very emotional. People at Disney, I think, I think it had an amazing impact because South African Blacks are African's just the door that they're doors here and white-side athletes as well. They'll do it the fucking even brace to all this and those and they haven't projected them and made it the fight about it and turned them into the potentially at least at a symbolic place. At a symbolic place. level being ugly. And with the same top blacks are left to sit, well, , if it had the effect of being the same well it's out, , it's not very to be moved out. And I think I told you the story that I was at Christmas party, our own Christmas party and nearly all our style of the blacks are there. And half the blacks are there with those were spring back caps to the Christmas party, which if you, if you, , the kind of  the as I, which was just an amazing, very moving shot, and frankly now it's just not mushy, really isn't. Nessma and Bella systematically tried to diffuse the old symbols of the power. Tragede formally all white neighborhoods made the order of part-time national anthem, part the new national anthem. One point Nessma and Bella had a lunch, and he invited the wise and the leaders of all the... prime ministers from during the apartheid era. And he also invited the wives and widows of the Black leaders in the matter as well, including Steve Bezos with us. And of course,  that Steve Bezos killed and prisoned by policemen in support of the old government. And that was in the time under the premiership of John Foster. And Mrs. Foster was the John Foster darts and time ago. But Mrs. Foster was there. And then the the position in the court of the New York, where they were all in the garden, serving a piece of garden chair. Mrs. Foster seems to be very careful to take the position sort of jumps up and offers her receipt and John Poster is wearing the card of the round of the wrist, the card of chair and the municipal piece, same family with the card minister and Mandela we got to sort of wear a boat chair, so I know that we much and when Dan and I look to the very stern and the red and the finger turns it. Now I'm supposed to be massaging down and doing as I say otherwise I'm going to be as a part of carry on if you're helping me out. It's me, but I'm not. Wow. I'm not. I'm not quite sure what to make with. Of course, there was a mixed thing. It was called by the question, which said that this is true. I've got it. I mean, I mean, this actually, this is how important do you think these vouchers are in changing the nation? How important are you versus in their say-goating houses in harmony with working? Well, , I must say I, as a sort of a hard-bitten political journalist or my life, probably didn't take them as serious in the government that I looked at how Palestinians or... changes and budgets and almost kind of things. But I have to consider I was well lacking. I failed to appreciate the importance of this. They've been extremely important. I still need to have left some evidence against it, surprisingly, by telling me about perhaps the less political family members. He went in after his symbolic changes, went to parts of what came down and what I never be in this place. and frankly they could have gone before for a very long time. But they didn't have confidence in themselves. And so the symbolic change meant seven people sort of symbolically very competitive areas where they might have legally entitled to December. But they wouldn't go there at that time, but they're so close and comfortable. That's how they can success. , if you had to ask me what is changed to the average black side, that's the definition. In terms of how? and so on, the improvements of modest, , the vast massive gaps out of everything for material commission, happens improved radically. In many cases, not at all, one has to admit. But what is really changed is a genuine change to people. Is psychological liberation feeling that this new country and with their above tuned and possibilities and the capabilities that we have to use this. Alright, alright, I appreciate it, I'll be back with you. You can see the full lot of good ammunition in the middle of the year. John Madison itself after coming up, good blacks and bad blacks, good whites and bad whites. That's all I'm gonna miss. Give us a Navier News reviewers please the read down our description Fans to seventh Kategoros in Ghana cough Thank we appreciate you a lot. tackle that. So that entry is really one of our sounds. Anything they think of. Today's show. with joy. How we're doing? As a nation. You lose your nation. So you're gonna say it. Absolutely. Red X3, good black spad blacks. For a perspective on how far black America and white America in its getting into one America, consider this story. New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell, that is cousins, lunatic, don't you make 12 years ago, this was when you saved the life. My cousin Rosie and her husband were out living two bedroom bungalows. and now we have Union working class neighbor Weston Park. From the outside to home, squarely playing, there's a beautiful park on the street. Up to schools, schools, girls, girls, girls in the valley of the middle of the street. Now that no one starts business, our language is so not sweet to be in this situation. Every morning, we put our suit business, calls, cute. No, our business takes our girl in sex. She likes to move to a... bigger hats, guard the city, just went to hell. She says to see the man guard the city is mostly white. In fact, she told one of her girlfriends, and said, he, her friend said she was crazy. Guarding city was no place for blackress. That's just the point. Rosie and around, can you make it? Get up. This doesn't mean that my cousins haven't sent them. and let them get to learn black. No, or job lunch with spests and the effort. There's boss there called him a nigger cut his ass. But no, it didn't take the person. That boss he says could play with Jews either. For people with college degrees or even so. Another time, no found out that a wife that worked in the next St. John with the same pocket relationship with 10,000 dollars a year more than this. Quick to step. No, no, is it race? Just see it doesn't quite understand. the set categories of Japan's. That's the best genealogy, it's national, the size of the month, 18 years old. It's different. This question of who Westernians are, how did the family sauce and the sea trip? The ratio of history is not true. In the past 20 years, the number of Westerners exploded. They're now happy, really, very loved. despite the recent arrive at the next potentially more money compared to us, with better neighborhoods, families and traffic, and the other area of fact was then in the same place as the Chinese crew members. What does it say about the nature of the races? There are not a group of blacks, but the same legacy of slaves in the American counterparts, and physically in the distinguishable form as well, can come here and succeed as well as the Chinese and the Koreans? It's overcoming races in the simple way to know those, which is just necessary. on sub-button, braided and moved on. Why is one with the last version in the other is not? The implication of questioning success is that racism doesn't really exist at all, at least not in the form of the regime that does. It implies that when the conservatives and Congress, the responsibility for any urban publicized nation. collective action with the poor themselves, the right. I think of the same aspect where we've rose in the realm of the church, some hamsters, but modern men. It was once a white church, and past decades, and taken everybody's moods, tried to leave. It's so squelves membership churches, botmages, and so on, and it's about to add a hundred seats to the same centre. Passure was white, when the band-up clubs play and complications for a rest of the court. Passure sometimes seems  a post. cannot meet the time in the years. I was wondering how long the light minister of AZ was taking place. Whether they want to be some kind of ground sweltering competition in place of one day out. But Nualta was my issue has never really come up. Nualta says in fact, he's happy with the same reason that he's happy with his anger. The people are caused the way of power should not enable his strength, to do not interfere in the matter. It isn't one of the things I said it would be narrow to compare his reasons. He wants to be part of the world, and when he says this, it's often a time to make perfect attitude for the University of college. Is this confidence, this optimism, this equanimity, all the separates the course of American blacks, the house and all around. This idea of the West is kind of superior black, it's not a new one. When the first wave of character is... in the past, at the black step in June 8th, in the rise of reference to the emphasis of the place in hardware education. In 1980s, the economists Thomas saw the idea serious much of a clinical, by arguing the West Indian intelligence historical and perceived character in the same country. According to Seoul, in the Americas, they've understood how to see the American, the art-alemic problems created in the South Korean series this matter. These were a hardship, spread out a large set of population. The other thing I was seeing was the batch of them. We were at white women's scarce, it was far more commingual. There was often large we were colored soon-fought, photo-middle class, forming various kinds of skilled and sophisticated tasks that were not meant to write to them. Doors were the Americans. They were carbon-dressed basins, farmers, and small businessmen. Many years in advanced-american canopants, doubting skills required education in-mission. My mother and mother came from this couple of class. Their parents were schoolteach, and tiny, their parents were buried in the fields of central Jamaica. My grandmother and grandfather's salaries combined put them fast in the lower rounds in little class. But their expectations went well beyond. My mother and her sister were pushed to them scholarships to offer in their staff boarding, their rent behind them. Later when my mother graduated, it was taken for granted to cheer at 10 universities in England. My grandparents had ambitions. But as a special kind of fish, one of the certainly the Americans that did not have. Their values were the same as those that said, so whole, that hard work in talent can actually be good. This, I think, is line-of-well, not quite a pre-shaped one, is that way is back in the stand. He can reach country. It is tempting to use the rest of these stir-fruits. The description does not exist. It's proof that the only thing in a city after the Americans have to leave up this world to rest in, to make the necessary contributions. But in fact, studies work places at higher level to ensure they're not, this is for traditional racism to start. The rest of the world is called Autonomists, and appreciating the impact of somehow far. Together, listen to a white manager to be by the harvests. What? Island Blacks who come over with their remember they may not have had to good life for the Earth they're going to try to strive to better themselves. I think there's a lot of American Blacks out there who feel weird and that's enough already. this is something that happened to the Ranset which is not there. I mean we've done so much of the Black people in the American hours time they got up to the butts. Here then are the two competing. ideas about ways to decide my side. The manager issues a blank, condemnation of American thoughts, even if it holds rest of your time to talk about deal. The example of Western ians is good plans, makes the old blank as you stay from your complex, all the years you express. The manager can tell black Americans to get off their thoughts without fear of sound and his own, as type of races, because he is simultaneously celebrated island plans, but they're working. The successive Westernities not prove discrimination against American Demonsus. Rather, it's the means by which discrimination against the mercants. It's given one last vicious twist. As if to say, I'm not so shallow, it's spicy, color-ish skin, because I found people who are coming from them. Now I'm in the spot. I grew up in Canada, and a little fun and happy. I grew up in Canada, and a little fun and happy. now in half a century. My father teaches math math in nearby Chris, and my grandparents. Many years she was the only black and half, but I can't remember wondering if we were in the different society. Back then, column number of good things has been to make a great student's math in any problem. My own college was not something I ever thought about my child, but it seems to stray back. The things changed ...eshbeh... this is Julie e. and it makes less than into the beginning and grows. Try not to come second and into New York, which is a state which is the upper and the upper. School and dining hall, I was served with the infamous Jane Prince Projects in Northern Toronto. He considered to make me. Drut trade and taking off, he said to the Jamaican. In the popular imagination Jamaicans were, no, well, frankly, he'd done totally against some misleading rules. After I moved downstairs, I was... over his scene in college, how West Indian celebrated his York Times in the spring drive, could represent just 500 miles in the West crime in this pitch. Didn't Torontoian see what was special at different in Western New York culture? That was the naive question. The West Indians were the first Indian professional black people in the snow, the one in Toronto, the half. They had no bad blacks to contrast with the new cars. No African American deserves to save you now, that is no way to perform America's They must keep people in China despite closing the well, similar to the speech. One eliminate is nice to say on the left, one of the elderly relies on the benefits of the business of the business. But it's not completely up in them is what has happened to make them to be in the trouble, is that it's not the end of the business. Or even the beginning of the business. But in the next industry, in the industry, in America, there is someone else in the business. in the newest, as in real, somebody always has to be with. I hope that was story first here in New York and I guess. We just started round on an international runway. We broke the gap, we kept the pale back home from overseas to the US. Actual good-wights at-wights. This next assessment of our state of international racial healing from radio producers to city of Iceland and Christina Egoff with J. Allison about a woman in Pearl and Brent Shan, Henry Leibers. I love the talk in us. I was the one time when we were younger. My father was very precious. I can walk from school to spring, and I had, he was  on the recliner with a newspaper, and I said, mom can, my friends, stay off and supper. And my father,  dropped the paper to look to see, he wasn't the little black girl. He said, my father's wall, the small steep. And she's , honey, I don't really think that's a good idea. She said, I can mend that. My father was , horrified. I was different. I really didn't see things. I don't know. I was called blind. Really? Still that incident, then we tried to cut the rules there. That wasn't it, sir. What the hell? What are you doing? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? My mother father would come Charles Charles, all my great grandparents, my own wife, all of them. And that's how the majority of this community works. Most of them, when they move on both, they all work together and kind of sell together. And that's sort of how this new state of soul. You find that a lot of people in the community are delayed. because I think this insecurity happens to him around and people are proud of their Irish and their crowds, their Catholic. And I think people, they stick to their own. when we're in grammar school there was one teen who was Protestant and we goofed down on him because he didn't believe in the same things as us. Because no one understood what a person was just into 커�ery, and  but because I don't know who…\" Yeah, the girls from town town. You hear so much about what everybody looks at that's on it but we go out. We know it is for our reputation on the things you do. But what the hell do we can? A voice and a lot of you too. We are here at my aunt, Mary Ellen's house on Elm Street in Chalsa. I'm here with my aunt Linda, my cousin, Patty, my cousin Donna, my sister-in-law Mimi, my cousin Mary-in, my aunt Obama, my cousin Sheila, and my aunt Mary-in-Lin, my grandmother who was the major actress of this wonderful family. Mary-in, wonderful woman, she had seven children, and she had 32 grandchildren and 43 grandchildren. I'd say about 70 percent still I mean, most people don't understand it if you're not in town. They always ask, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us, they want to be, they wish they were, they don't understand what it's . It's nothing, that's what happens here. Everybody knows everybody. So it's a kind of string that you don't find in other areas. I mean, have 17,000 people in majority of them have major relatives, or you make a big difference in this community. بة HalstanderTalk. Once bus in the car I want to clear up 7.6. When the federal government made it , bus, the code or bus. My junior year was a total of 10. Everything changed. In one of the cases, people were never exposed to minorities. And all of a sudden, they fell in the classroom in this turmoil, in the streets in this turmoil, in the house, in this turmoil, in the news, in the cities erupted with racial violence, officers around the space where they are Greek police officers, prostitute, my junior year, everyone's following everyone. Whoever the crowd does, if they throw rocks, if they beat up a black person, you stand and watch where's it? As a Catholic you realize that we don't treat it on that, but everyone forgot it. There's  this total man, school wasn't the same, we were metal detectors put in the classroom, in the entrance of the school who was policeman everywhere at night they were burned cows, those total crazy. There was a major. rally our Boston City Hall Plaza, the Black Man, was attacked with the America flag because he was black and walking front of the rally, which was all right. And he was standing with the American flag. The Harvard Hall was all over the place and he was across the world, child sales, which the racist Boston police have quite a score of eight and one, who was. I was never going to see someone in my eyes. I thought it was a cool bottle. I thought it was a bottle. When I was in junior high, the biggest thing was to get up to the hospital. Because that was where you'd rather go in, those teachers were still there. You could still talk to your mother about the bathroom story or but that doesn't occur anymore because there is no child of her. Now school itself, you don't know what you want. My kids will probably go to the profiles. They won't do Chals on iTunes, they may do, , same comments, she does, but I go. Then when my parents get together, they all sing Chals on Ice on. It's  a little pep rally when we're all at a family gathering, but that won't happen for much. I think that's how it's going to be. Let's get it. I'm going to look right here. Come up close to me. Ready? Go. Here. See. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Way. You. Go. Go. Go. Hey, very close. Go. Go. Go. Go. You're going to chill in today. Go. Go. Go. When happened on the Okusho, we're see. And he had a white man who was married to a white woman. He disowned his children for being associated with black men. And then, in fact, the son's grandchildren, because they were the black men. And I was saying, that's a disgrace, that you blood, you don't disown one in damn sin. I don't know what to say. So he was right. I don't know what I would do. I've understood his 별. I would say that, which we have discussed with Green Blink that I would tell you something in fear of mine, that I would  to think I am all reminded about race, more so than ever been. That came down to my thoughts too, and I would always tell you everything. I mean, after three years, I would say a race is probably a bit of the on-stour race, how was race or what? And my problem is that I have to cross. I think it's rough, so I'm fine. I got rid of it, but I would never say anything to my girls, but still learn. Still learn what's this, what you want, what you want, that you screw up around to see and take people. Still look at anyone that's not  them, I don't have to tell them that. It sounds even if I had no, I liked the way I grew up, and I can't move, rather say, I'm old, and I don't have a problem, because I'm not gonna push you on, I'm only  that. I hope some daily Mary and Irish kept it for you. No. I don't think there's any one with that. Other people say that's the reason. I think it's natural for  your own kind of people. I love you, you love me, you love me. It's crazy. I love you, I love you. , I think it's a really good person. You must have to grow up somewhere where you walk down the street. There's a boy at Kiddachani, she can't wait to see him. Of course we can clean together. I just can't imagine that. That's some kind of made up beer here. Everyone gets walked together. I can't imagine. I think it's something very bad for me. I think it's... I think it's a good... to teach you, but  what can tell you not to be a student, and you can tell you the  to black neighbor after you're doing so I think it's a person's choice to get used to reading and you can choose to be fair. I was Captain the Chilli doesn't. I remember his test was with Chilli, which was also the visit director, she said she and chose theplaying chant kat , this is Summer Morning. my whole life. This might be going with the children's cap. She said to me one day, if a black girl tries off a chili, it's a turn and I start to myself. I'm going to be a jerk if I don't go along crowd. It was very difficult decision. And I knew this would be jeopardized with her. I'm kept. She put her head down to walk away. So, the day of children try out. She came into the room of all the girls, which said traditionally, Charles and I said to chill and capped it, this is all we want. I put my head down and I said to cry, because I knew I knew I'd blow it. It was  my first experience with race, making a long decision. So we're all in the room, which says the chill and capped it for us here is calm. I started all of my eyes on those legs. Oh my God, I looked up at her, and she knew that I knew. So that I had made a lot of choice. I knew I made a lot of choice but I needed for my hat to raise in house where we're So going to 1 million dollars? 1 million? 2 million價? Cause we are so good. Ugh, they don't feel  you're regular. that's not sharing this involved with pueda to decide When shampoo is on, I can't even think about it. I'm going to pick up the hair or two. Other than how monkey is your chicken. We don't need no music to cheer. They stamp their face. They don't move. They feel ... Oh, you want to just slap them and say, Stop, I mean, look so cool. Don't move, don't move. That's what they're talking about. And that's what they're excited to do. Yeah. I'm excited to go away. I'm of city decided to go to Chennai for a moment. I was hoping for a moment. I was hoping for a moment. I was hoping for a moment. I was hoping for a moment. And we would  to put a mature here. In this was  getting ahead, these common pens were, we taught you that girl because she was different because she had an effort and I never said because she was black and I was a pattern that I was as racist as a person. It's not something of problem and I think we're going to teenager. It's a constant effort to write that. Then we go and search on whether Okay, thanks for all of us for all. It's gonna be on racism. We realize it's a very sensitive issue. We're not here to try to change anybody's mind. What we want to do is raise the consciousness button. We want to talk about it. We'll have a lot of fun with it. A couple of rules, watch it both. Swaring a little respect. You can, of course, speak your own opinions, but put with a little take. Understand? , okay. We're gonna start. You asked me when I was 10. What I've been... work for the city without a black people I would have told you crazy. I'm above them and then I don't work with makers. That's what I was told. When I was 10. When I first took this job, I actually had trouble working with people across the system that I was related. But I was in the ice pool and then we bustle. So there was a lot of racial rioters who told me, every day I ate this. things in their apple. I hate it. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to talk to them. I was a classmate, friends. In almost all of the post, I wouldn't accept black things in the top of my head. I've taken incredible stripes, stars, septic, up-chewed, I'm educated. So you took a great seminar with septic. So you'll be a lot of people who gave it. because you have to color this place. This one is for a guy to eat something. One of his balls, motion circle. So when I want you to do with the sword, spread all the balls. Now I need a one, from the face. One of the circles. Okay, now I'm gonna tell you to do something. I want you to always undo it, okay? I want  his second foot clear. I want the second foot clear. I want him to do it. Walk  you're Irish! Okay, people aren't in, walk as if you carry something in. Okay, walk  you black! My problems, probably race. Go out of that! And I can't even believe that he's not the person who needs sexual support there, which was very important for the rest of all of us. Did you lead by example? I can't lead by example. It's such an important part of, I think, each family, and I would say, on the whole that, the majority of racism is my fault. Swimming ground upward. Swimming here. Swimming told. It's happening. great growth, take that pattern to someone, just as black. And I would bet my paycheck that in your home, racism is serious issue and also serious problem. And it was for me, and taking a long long time to overcome it, although this I still have fears.
