  "text": "Well, in this moment, of our presidential election process, let us consider the part of a group who sat faith we do not usually listen. Group we do not usually count among society's victims. I refer to moderate Republicans. Because they have seen the future and the future has a name, and the future's name is Bob Bell. The man now invariably referred to it. because the presumptive nominee, except of course by himself, the most first himself has Bob Dull. And they are a pragmatic, relevant year sleeves get the job done group as a whole, the moderate Republicans are. And they will do what is necessary for victory in the fall and get to get the White House. But just last week when we convened a small unscientific panel for Republicans, only wonderful. It was actually half about the presumptive nominee. The first one was the first one. Welcome to the BBE's Chicago Duitis, your radio playhouse. Am I right last in our program today? Politics, economics. , a big picture. Later on on our program, we hire two temp workers, and we put them to work doing a radio story about being... and these guys aren't office workers. These guys are part of the massive number of workers in our country right now who do temporals and factories and industrial settings. That will be at two, and then newsletter, because right now we're on at one. Presumptuous. The Republicans we convened for our panel were these people and gave very generously of their time, I should say, because the... how or when out and maybe peer in middle of our interviews. These people, not only, we started our interview, then we had to take them out for drinks. And then we had to bring them back, so this is kind of, not just presumptiveness, but it's presumptiveness on the rocks. That's what this segment is. Republicans were wheel-tinkin' a bond trader, Diane Cohen, an attorney who is, I think it'd be more accurate to describe her as a little terian than a moderate Republican. It's still shared some views with these guys. Brian Kniss from Branden Keppert. a bond trader and money manager and 43rd word Republican committeeman and Dan Kriesy who owns a pizza restaurant on the suburbs and also works as a telephone technician for a merit tag. And as of last Tuesday, this was a junior Tuesday before super Tuesday for the New York primary before Bob Dowe was fully named that presumptive nominee. Weel was the only one of the four people in our panel who would look as squaring. and actually say he had a favorite hand bit. Dol, and the reason I  Dol is I just think I  the way he's held together in his past this past month, talk about a trial by fire. His resume is impressive. He's got a unique perspective and dare I say I might be excited by Bondo. Smiles all around that should say for people who in the radio I think it's everyone else to tape. just had a little grand and there's a sort of rolling device from Diane Diane. I'm just in denial, I'm waiting for Jack Kento announced so I'll have to start out. So you're having trouble finding a candidate who you liked? Yes. They don't represent the ideals that brought me into the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan brought me in and candidates I see are just not inspiring me in the same way. Brian? Well I had liked Governor Pete Wilson and California early on and so I was probably the most loud person here at the panel. and see, see, when I'm quickly. But I think Bob Dole would probably be a very good president, and I  Forbes as well. Dan, what about you, are you having trouble finding a candidate you can learn? I wish that Bob Dole could get his excited about Bob Dole's will has gotten about Bob Dole. At the time, Dan and Brian were still deciding between Dole and Forbes. They and describe yourself as off the map, no candidate at all. They also said they wanted the next president to be somebody who would reduce the size of government. Nick, have really much body footage, Brian and Dan were especially forceful about the idea of eliminating federal deficit. And so I proposed a theoretical candidate to our panel. Somebody who would balance the federal budget in just a few years, somebody who promises to reduce the size of government and cut the capital gains tax. Somebody who is for the death penalty and tougher sentences for juvenile offenders. Somebody who is pro-choice, all four of them said they would at least be curious to hear more about such a candidate. That's it, I think. put it. I'd  to hear what she has to say. And then I reveal to them that this theoretical candidate, the person who I was describing to them as an acceptable moderate Republican, was if you haven't guessed this already, President Cranj. This is where he stands for these issues. Is there a query stands this week? One of elaborate on that point. Everybody around the table against smiled. I let go with the answers. We may agree with a lot of the... positions that President Clinton carries today. And again, I say today, but we don't know where he'll be tomorrow. I don't happen to believe that President Clinton is as high of integrity person that we should have in White House. I think that most of the Republican candidates right now do hold that integrity. And I'd rather see more than well. I can't think of anybody in the field right now. Republican field that. would not do better than President Clinton would the same do. For many people, the coming presidential election is a lot  the last one in one significant way. For these people, there is only one issue. They do not  Bill Clinton. But maybe need, moderate Republicans to be persuaded over to Bill Clinton's side, the way that moderate Democrats and droves in masses and in national waves. persuaded over to Ronald Reagan side, George Bush's side, once. Anyway, angeless did little help to find out. Okay, well joining us now by telepharm is Gary Lepel who stayed chairman of the Democratic Party. Gary Lepel, are you there? I'm here. All right, so you're there. So Gary Lepel, let me just review for a second, the four Republicans who are seated here with me have conceded that when it comes to the issues, many president Clinton stands in promises. is fine with them, but when it comes to him, the man, they are perhaps not so comfortable. Do you want to try to sell them on the idea for a second? I have to rule it. OK. Well, I mean, this is a person that is probably the first generation, our generation, that has become president and our generation. I think it's our time to provide leadership of this nation, that you look into a map, so he's headed. I should say that at this point the panel looked around to each other and everybody was shaking their heads This was clearly not working with our panel and this might seem  an odd approach for Gary Lepel to take But according to newspaper reports to differentiate President Clinton and Bob Dowe share many of the same stands of many issues White House officials are saying that they're going to play up the age and generation difference Gary Lepel is basically giving us a preview here of all we're going to be hearing throughout the next few months as we get into the general election Carrile Pell is saying what basically any leading Democratic politician would be saying about the president that this moment And what was interesting about it was it was not persuasive with our panel Gary I I agree that he is of course of a certain Baby boom generation but That to no excuse for for some of the things what I guess what I wrote was saying before was we agreed with some of his positions today But they're not positions he next necessarily helps six months ago a year ago or two years How do you answer the question that he doesn't stand on the issues firmly? Well, I would have to say that when he first got in the office the first six months we stood very firmly and got the economy back on track and put a plan in place. The Board of I. Only Democrat, it has reduced the deficit three years in a row, first time, very true, and is reduced at five over 50%. I mean that was the whole debate 759 in Brussels. We discussion of the economy. people were astonishingly well informed, I should say. They threw around budget numbers and dates and specifics about the first Clinton budget and the second Clinton budget and consequences for social security What was interesting was that none of the Republicans gave President Clinton any of the credit for the eight million jobs created over the last four years for the rising stock market The record number of new small business starts, a panel has said that the normal business cycle would have done all of that anyway They pointed out that among these jobs were a disproportionate number of of low wage jobs. And even the one area where President Clinton did stick his neck out when his first budget, which did make dramatic cuts in the federal deficit, even here they gave the president no credit. The cuts were not deep enough and not done with real conviction on his part. They said, Gary LePel, however, kept trying. Even the federal budget, people who say, oh, we'll never grant her big vendors and we've got a cut government right now under the bill Clinton. We have the lowest federal government workforce in the state of Canada, two hundred and seven thousand less federal employment. under this president from the day to go off his cell. I'm  working, he's agreed. The thing I often budget in seven years. Gary the Pellet, I'm afraid I don't think you're winning many converts if people are checking their heads now. I think it will give you four potential voters, but I don't believe that you've brought them home. We may be right on all the issues regarding pro choice. We may be right on the economic policies. Go after matter, it Republicans. But if you have people that are basically Republicans. because they don't  being out of the out of the office, they're going to have to pick whatever their Republican nominee is. Of course, the thing that bothers these Republicans the most about the Oakland is waffling on the issues. It's something that the presumptive Republican nominee does plenty of as well. Bob Doe has gone back and forth on the no-new taxes pledge. For a while, when Papukan and Miss Scoring lots of votes with economic, populism, Republican style, Bob Doe tried to pick it up. Bob Doe even wavered on abortion rights a few weeks ago on television. Brian Castle on our panel pointed out, a panel still prefers Bob Dole's way of writing to the presidents. Bob Dole certainly has made some changes in his positions over a period of time, but I guess I have to believe that someone who spent so many years in Washington who has learned process as well as Bob Dole does have some base beliefs and I believe that and I really have a hard time believing that the current president does, I think Bob Dole would be much preferred to present Clinton even with a waffle here or there. Thanks fish! I wonder if somebody observing this process, if in the end, whether it's dull or Clinton in the White House, if we'll end up with significantly different policies coming out of the White House, that is under the Clinton presidency, what we've seen is the debate driven by the Republicans and Congress , and that's certain to continue even in a dull presidency. And the president, if he's kind of a commentator who either Clinton or dull is, was simply foul of the political type of where it goes and gets similar results. Well, I think... I guess to some extent I want to do offer a bit of a reality check because I think that even if we have a Republican president come in, we'll have most likely a Republican Congress at the same time. The Republican ideas will then become law in some form. They may not be the exact form that we want at one particular period of time but the country will trend in that direction and I believe that's good for the country. I would vote for Bob Dole, even with Mike. concerns because I would view his him as a facilitator of a Republican Congress and that is where my hope lies that together we could see progress. So you don't see President Clinton as being a kind of moderate Republican who happens to simply go into the name of Democrat. I think Bill Clinton is proven that if we want moderate Republicans to be moderate Republican, if we would  a lion's and he belongs. We'll take in time. and cone, blind castle, and Dan Grease. Where will you go? Not when I'll be old So away I'll be sad and blue Crying all of you Dear old would beg me still he would beg and steal just to feel yes just to be oh oh oh oh I want your heart beating close to my so close to my well you will go Oh, darling, I'll be alone, so long. Making all my knees, all I ask is please, please love me. Oh, yeah. Activate. the economy. And let's begin this act with the man who made the economy, a nationalist who again, and the man who he steals all his, that's lines calm. I believe in free enterprise, I believe in capitalism, but I believe we all ought to share in the prosperity. We think corporations shouldn't make profits. We support international free trade. But corporate greed is skewering an economy. I think it's wrong. us for our own workers in the doggy dog competition people in Mexico make it up and out the miracle worker can compete with the Mexican worker can compete with the Chinese worker you cannot compete with slave labor and we should not have to it is long of course our workers to compete with people who make shoes in China for 25 cents an hour well that was Patrick J. Buchanan and did everyone do what that chase dance for her could it be could it be Jessie well no They could. And of course, Patrick J. Buchanan's prescription for our nation are very different than those offered by Jesse Jackson. Thanks to Patrick Buchanan, we had it at a month, a front page, front burner discussion of what is happening in the new common. And to review those facts briefly, I find one phrase coming to my lips. It is a phrase. I can say that his never come to my lips before, kind of a radio phrase. That phrase is. Let's do the numbers. A New York Times survey shows that one third of all American households have had someone laid off since 1980. One tenth of the adults in this country say that a layoff precipitated a major family crisis. Among most people who get laid off do find new jobs. Two thirds of them do not find jobs that pay as much as their old jobs. Media and wages in this country have fallen at three per cent since 1979. Just a different place. while stock prices have set record levels and corporate profits have risen. And one way that lots of businesses have helped their bottom lines is by replacing full-time workers with temporary workers and with contract workers. And one side of the times is that the largest employer in the United States, outside of the government, of course, the largest private employer is now a temp agency, manpower incorporated. They send out 800,000 times a year. And to give you a sense of just how big that is. Let's compare that with some other numbers. Do we have that music again, please? General Motors only has 347,000 employees in North America going only has 1,006,000 Wouldn't it be irritating if every time somebody says a number on the radio? No, they'd just be going long and they'd just be talking about this and that and this and that and then suddenly they'd mention 14 of you here It would be  some weird distorted adult sesame street. Nightmare is what it would be. I don't know if it is on it. Yeah, and I'll drop you. Although it is the largest employer in the country, when you visit man powers, downtown Chicago office, it doesn't feel  it's the outpost of the corporate giant. It feels  what it is. A small box, just seven people. with the idiosyncrasies of any small office. For example, where other offices might use hosted notes, or those while you were out, message pads, these people use coasters, round with gold borders, left of them from some promotional something years ago. But manpower is as good advantage point as any for observing trends in the economy. Manpower spokesperson Stephanie Black says that in the last five years, the nature of the temp business has changed a lot. Companies have worked for ways to reoff permanent staff. and replace them as needed with temps. The business environment has changed enough where with the competitive global market, they need to maintain a core amount of staff that is productive and that they keep for all the time, and then they fill in for special projects or keep periods or seasonal fluctuations by using temporary help. While manpower has been the beneficiary of these changes with the increased business, actually this happened whitecake. Spain's dissape that manpower did not create the ship in the way the corporation's higher or way off-workers. Simply responded. The responded well though, some companies used so many dozens of tanks all the time that manpower sends a full-time manpower representative to work on site at the company to coordinate all the tanks. And while 40% of manpower's business is office workers, the 40% is industrial workers, the past is growing part of its business, rising from nothing. 20% just in the last few years is a category whose very existence does you know about what's going on in the economy. These are technical workers. Computer programmers, land administrators, CAD designers, chemists, biology, I mean all sorts of different types of assignments. And many of those are project-based assignments where they are, , last six months. Come in and stall and you network six months later. It's over with. They don't want to hire someone. A company doesn't want to grace someone in full time. For a position that's only been a last six months. This is the kind of work that 10 or 15 years ago might have been done by full time employees. Having said that, it's important to note that one reason that manpower has become the largest employer in the country is that it gives the people who work for it fairly good deal, health insurance, paid vacation, and decent money, skilled secretaries from the Chicago office, made from $9 an hour to $16, and manpower will train them to do particular jobs that it knows there's market for it. But to get to the bottom of what it's  to be a temp in today's economy, we at this radio program decided we needed to go to the source. And so we hired two temp workers ourselves. And when they showed up at the radio station, we told them that their job while they were working for us was to prepare their own radio stories about what it's  to be a temp. The two guys we got came from an agency called Neighbor Tamps whose motto is, yes, we can. As opposed to most of the temp agencies we caught, assignment, who told us. know they could not. Our two-temp workers were named Lee and Tito, and they normally don't get sent to office jobs  this. Normally, these guys do light industrial work, general labor, factory work. Two of our producers, at least speaking, and Nancy update, took them into the radio studio with a list of possible questions they might use, and preparing the radio reports about being a town. Check this one up. There's dumping pay the bills or do you have another job in the screen? horizontal to the bottom at the camera. damn real. I can't see well along some people were full-time they'd come from. I'll see how you live unless you live 80 in a house. Hmm. Yeah, I'll split. Oh that was the nominian. You're not gonna get rich to a business. Definitely. But you keep a hat towards the end of the day. That's Lee who made the little tortilla joke towards Tito. He was constantly ritting him with these little ethnic  I don't even know the word that we should use here in Plight Company. I'm ready. Oh just a little ethnic ribbing  and just a  Tito. Somehow gave as good as he got here. Here's how he described Lee when he asked him to describe Lee for our stories Long hair. Notice, Alex lee, tonight lower than Noah and I talking with its wife. I tremendous thought smoking, hooker buying, drinking, just listening rock and roll banking, standing to walls. I should say that they seem to have a lot of fun during their stories. this- these two little quotes as you hear presently. The assignment was profile at your fellow town. So in other words, Lee interviewed Tito and did a story about Tito's experience and Tito interviewed Lee and did a story about Lee's experience. They have two reports for you. The first one that we'll hear is the report that Lee prepared about Tito. Hi, I'm Lee. I work at Labor Tito is currently working眾 around 21. She goes to Chimshu who's being closed. and they kind of put up for lunch added to when we work at Labor Time to get up early in the morning and go to no garage looking place and wait around with a bunch of people waiting to get work There's two steps right once more and one big one stand up let me know what's that maybe four people fit there a little bit of comfort stand up and go there you'll have a feast but I'll just add you we can once that hold it up to the edge where does it mean? So  you go there you might have at least go good honey honey okay then you might have probably 10 companies and constantly probably want 5 people each you gotta look at it  that so that's why people say you have to be up in your days because they got choose all kinds of people work at labor time next two we're re draw you quite awesome women. Everyone's there for different reasons. Some work one day a week for bare money, some Italian sport for families, for me it's mostly part of time thing. My main job is doing some forge with a friend of mine Mike. I do some graphics. I worked out about six years in knowledge and math field and I do some computer programs that went to the right for me. The start of about two years ago at Labor Tips when we played the、 or did for working with ladies, soldiers. So I was raised in the survival street survival street life office. So I was always raising if you can't make it here. Hey, put it that corner. When did you stop? No, I was a joke. That's what a tip came in. Go from Drake coin. People says he makes about 150 weeks at labor times. So in drugs, you can make five times there in a single day. And look at that, and then, and then, drop. How's that? Be my music, do. The female gets you to do it. I mean, the way I got into it, labor times. Do it. Explain yourself. The way I got into labor times was always, I was finished coming into the shower after my mom. Chill. I was thinking to speak about it. I've met a few more, so I can hear whatever we want. I want you to be safe and walk away. That's what I went. It was a crowd coming at the end of it. It's  drugs, , you don't do that type of drugs, but it is your girl. And it's , come on, please, please. You can do it, venture. Temporary disease and effect, which quality is agency, temporary worker, don't care the T-O-Spects, but it's much empowering you. No care because they're most of the jabs. Nobody wants garbage. Most jabs are temp jabs going to minimum wage. It's hard to have a strike against you, a key to the finish. You did great. I think people that you're going to say, yeah, we'll call you. They never call you. They're going to say, , when you apply, they're going to say, yeah, that's it. Okay, we'll call you. We'll just blow it up. Once I see a school thing, over. For your radio playhouse, I'm weak. Hopefully one day I'll open the wish. I'll wait for you in the evening. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. I'll be with you in my morning. when we were in the wild, kiss and kick, when everything, , the dog kick them all the way because he's in front of him going on that same thing. That was the story that we did about Tito. Next we have the story that Tito did about ways. Until I work with Lee, he's been tempting not knowing issues and crazy dreams. He's worked at different meetings but he's been a liberty for longness. We had one assignment to an agency, that's the only thing. That's the funny thing. Temporary doesn't mean short. He means no benefits, no pensions, no jobs security. That's why they hire 10 points. coming running to the market after the shift. They keep this modest possible standard for 10 workers just keep those money on this. It's  maybe five employees and they have three shifts running. Here are all tabs. Shifts after shifts in tabs. They pack 30 of it. 20. They'll have three different copies of three to three cents a total. Yeah, it's true. The most places we go though, there's a mix of permanent and tamp workers. So where? relationship sometimes it must be streets you better than the permanence sometimes they treat you worse sometimes we work for us to learn the permanence in the 90s or mess with you once we work that a factory that may tarse it the tarse it will deliver to these big pipes I'll send you here it's girly the most system everybody took off on the tip everybody takes off diving behind things and hiding and this is all a matter of seconds I see this happy so I turn off some running and that is getting some in this big air bubble comes out This ooze splatters all over Everybody's laughing man. What you tell me? It's got So everyone's so I get to big bubble in the system and if you don't work there you'll never notice Sometimes companies often use full time jobs That happens to me once but it's probably worth it that's me I would take pretty much any four times. 5, 6, 7, 9 and it needs better importance than you find now. Leaf is different. Nobody wants penny money for anything that is skilled. I think I'll grab this. Go to type city house. Okay, any more? We'll give you five bucks an hour or run up the green one. One guy, why I mean work is a huge success. 20 grand per asking... way, man. They want to pay little for certain why certain work this takes your experience. We already are playing house on TV. what's funny about artists? We walked on a school with a level of minute, and walked and we're going to average all of the artists. I have a voice in the middle of saying, he would raise his head. He had some weird jobs out of him. Because it would, out there's  an embarrassing thing. , it's , person in, , , you're low  you're no-bye. Okay, so tap music to end the story. I asked both of you guys to hit on the ear here in the studio with me. Hey, should you bring in some music to this song? You asked to bring in, , did you write in? It's on the set. What are we hearing? What are we hearing? What do we hearing? Cooked my. I used to be a good thing. And watch the song come after your guest story. Because it's on some other dinner.

So stay tuned. rhythm. That's where I want to be. Alright, program continues in a minute. We're listening to your radio playhouse. It's your radio playhouse. Okay, well, Tito and you guys are both still here. We're going to get the falsepris and music going here. So we can get to that moment. And you guys are still looking for jobs, right? Yeah. And so people who listen to the radio story, they could hear about some of the things you do. If they want to, I guess we should set this up. At least ego at a you're ready to play house fun if you if you have a judge What do you guys what kind of job you guys with for here?

In the next 20 minutes and if you're not in the phone now, but you got to jump these guys, pause during the week here at the radio station 832-3380 in the 312. Act 3. That. Well, we asked Lisa Baskani if she had anything to contribute to a program today about the economy. Lisa is a Chicago poet and writer, a former leader of the National Poetry Slam now resides in New York City. And she said she did have something, she had a story about her problem. And I remember him doing that time. That time that will exist forever in Quartz. marks, emphasized heavily to save the family from having to actually discuss it at length. It is morning. It is always morning because no matter how many talk shows or warm movies he stayed up to watch the night before, he rises with the sun or it's winter absence. He rises because there is work in the morning. There always has been, either it was assigned to him or he found it himself. But there is work. And morning, it's time to get it. I hear his knees popping as he sits at the kitchen table with black copy in his sigs, to read two papers that to lead a blade and the Detroit free press. Two papers, because that would lower the odds that would double the chances, increase the opportunities to find work, work that he has recently lost. When I see him, there is no work. It is Northwestern Ohio in the middle of its continuous session. He has shaken both papers on all of their news. and there is no work. It is all he can do to keep him dropping his pride the seventh veil, and answering the aluminum sighting or used car sales ads. Some days are better than others though. On the good days, there is work, and he circles the ad with an ad zebore and victorious red pen and heads upstairs to his office. His office, for as long as I can remember, had a huge desk cluttered with spec sheets and promotional brochures. Feet your wzcourse. whatever he was selling at the time, bright, four-colored photos of appliances or mattresses arranged in ways that would prove these items to be necessary, a sense of the customer who well-being and happiness. Whatever he was selling, it was always essential in necessary. But when I see him, the desk is bare. The clutter has been swept away. Even his answering machine messages empty because he has no company. that he probably represents, no business cuts. Time has become his greatest enemy. His unemployment insurance is running out. He has long since passed the age when most companies will consider hiring him. He leaves the age blank empty on the application form, but, personal managers still rush him through interviews after one look at his tastefully growing temples, and some civil matters in his job experience. Time! time has become a shifting empty in my mouth then. Two months become six months, six months becomes a year. He drives the fillet by painting the house and organizing the basement. I see my mom, weak with the weight of it. She is pale from going to work and arriving home at the sun. I see her lips then, and her knuckles whiteness she puts a bill payment off another month is they max out enough. credit card as they second mortgage the house. It's never been this bad. Together, it clips three kids through college and it was never. She's struggling with her tongue with her ever present desire to scream at him, do something. Everything they built together a slowly crumbling and she wonders if they'll survive. When I see him who's typing call for letters. I hesitate. two-fingered pecking on an old Smith corona with a fading ribbon. The family smiles quietly and re-writes, corrects his grammar, telling him, Daddy, take this out. You sound too desperate. But after all, you write what . And what he knows is he has 30 years of experience. 30 years of smiling when he didn't want to. 30 years of forcing laughter into the phone of looking into narrow skeptical eyes. a fast food 30 years of paperwork, a business trips and cut-break motels, of driving backwater towns in white-out storms 30 years of the word no 30 years of straight commission was as the hardest, toughest way to go and God damn it that's gotta be good enough or someone. He is living with the firm knowledge that there is nothing that he can't do. I'm a terrifying yell and he did the wrong thing, I love to do. I see his talking my dad now. about his unemployment in his prospects for the future. Nothing's ever said. He'd be most of the time there's not to say. I wish him luck and think that sometimes only the intangibles can set things right. When I see him, he thinks he's alone, but he's not. All across Ohio, the Midwest, America, thousands of white, middle-aged men just... data attending workshops, haunting placement agencies and training centers, filling their chests with the ghosts of their bravado, straining to understand why what one's worked for them doesn't work any longer. They play their losing game the way they always had, pulling desperately on bootstraps, noses, frankly to grind stones. These men refuse to question the validity of the business structures that they establish a vicious system that whip the round in. and fit them in the first chance of God. It is this ignorant blind faith that makes me think, good. Let the men who made the rules and carried out the policies suffer the consequences of these policies. They chose management to pay scale, let them live without the protection of a new. Let the most privileged class of our society taste the fear and frustration that the rest of us know on daily basis. Then I think of my dad. How are you? How time weighed him down and wore on him  a seal or stone? I would use that on a moon. I would use that on a moon. I would use that on a moon. I would use that on a moon. Bring the money in, bring the money in We won't have no donor spend, do you bring that money in it takes money. What a nickel in the pot boy. To have all of life's joy, time in the pot boy. Each and every one, Linda helping hand. What if I sense what a nickel in the pot, not all of it? Bring the money in Bring the money in We won't have no dough to spin. Do you bring that money again? At court, economic development should have a style. But we as a nation are not helpless in the face of broader economic forces. We can take action. We can spur economic development. Wouldn't this one of the high-visited buildings? The city of Chicago, the state of Illinois, had a cost of $156 million tax paramount. Navy pure. Navy pure is a downtown waterfront project, and Lake Michigan, not far from the heart of downtown Chicago, but not in and either. Plots of cities have development projects  this, this fan your Holland Boston, Baltimore and your Harvard, New York South Street Seatboard. Navy pure features a big Ferris wheel, this Chicago Children's Museum. One of this I-Mex movies. theaters. There's convention for space, there's some shopping, a food court. To add this viewer is that of a second-rate mall, anywhere in America, the roof leaks, the food's nothing special. The stores aren't at the kind you go out of your way to visit. We had this radio program a very familiar with Navy Pier, because Chicago's public radio station recently moved to a new building, located halfway between the Ferris wheel and the convention space. Our staff spent so many hours walking, drafting hallway between the food court and our offices. It's so easy to produce your Peter. County has committed to memory. The song here come the Hawks, the official theme song which Cago's happy theme. Thanks for a while. For reasons we've never been able to fully understand or its pain, I've been cess of the hallway PA system. We have watched the fascination. Some of the strange conventions that have come and gone here it may be here. One day. struggling to the end of the peer-first and fresh air. I looked into it's a bit hall A, saw an entire carnival need way. Please full-size rides, multi-colored rides, flat music. The equipment so massive, it's hard to comprehend how that you can get it indoors. Here it was, under the artificial lights during the dead of Chicago. A few months before we outgawped at the convention, whose purpose was to help small businesses market their products generation X. This was, as far as we could determine, American capital. was an disturbingly odd, neither. Sanxolo, you didn't want to see it there. Trying to market to a generation, supposed to defining characteristic is that it's comprised of non-Materialist, non-conformist, psychotypes who above all present products being marked with team. So, if you found the contest, you could demonstrate your real memory, Johnny Gondol, then Stray Cherry on your memory, and we're taking the next four key vitamins. So, people find out for our time-tankers. Johnny Gondol's number We can only wonder if a generation X karaoke contest could have been more popular had there actually been an audience involved. But the generation X convention was one of the least successful events I've ever heard. The most important single fact about this $156 million economic development project is that, by all accounts, it is a huge, huge success. Crowds or choices are just that they want to expect it. 3.5 million just six months. People even came during the winter. And it many, many. doors and restaurants business school. This is by far, I think, our best seller. Describe what this is. This is a t-shirt. It's just a t-shirt and we have it and both the signs we have it is plain white t-shirt and what it is is just a kind of just a different look of the skyline, a fun instead of your just regular old skyline picture. Just a really fun design showing Chicago with a nice little heart world kind of representing the earth. Very best home and it was the store. Oh yeah. Yes, Chicago, which will set an upscale gap store with bond with boys, selling t-shirts, caps with the word Chicago women. And various designs, none of them, so you're probably the Hackney Old Alcombo, Chicago Monster, and this is so-girious calendars. The t-shirts you were showing me sells 25 or so on, typical day at $15 a shirt, most of her customers can have a town. They're going to meet me here by something for themselves, and for a loved one, whether be a child or a, I think, , a spousal unit or... These are the kinds of jobs and businesses. that have been created so far for $156 million. Mary Beth Pullman's happy at the field for sales to exceed the expectations, and actions. But  most new businesses anywhere, it takes a lot for your real life's real profits. It appears to be no less in the year. She figures it will be another two for the store's company talk. And in the meantime, she's earning less than she did in her old job, granting shopping center space. Fortunately, she has a style so you enter to grow and help the suburbs earn money. So she doesn't have to draw a sell or even store right now. Any money that I'm taking out. of the source really got kind of being put right back in for inventory and such because we are coming into our peak season. So that's how I mean my compensation is  I could draw the salary out if I wanted to at this point in time it's in my best interest in the business that's what just to kind of just put it right back in for inventory. The store has seven employees and they earn between $68 an hour. Which is about parking it here. That's 12 to $16,000 a year. Now I'm much if you're trying to raise a family, the most of the people you see working at the year. For in the 20s and early 30s. just starting out. Nigel, for example, works in the T-shirt store, happily, and uses the money to go to college, the other half. He goes with his parents, helps to go to Los and take a national law. I do speak Spanish, I'm bilingual. So maybe in the long run, maybe have some business dealings and Mexico stuff and that's what I wanted to do. For now, I'm working for my best here at Oyesha, Kagawa. In fact, many workers on the field said they would go ahead and have these jobs. didn't complain, but one maintenance man told me that he made more money  care care products used to report, a whole layoffs sent here. He was looking for another job. Maybe peer officials are tight-lipped about the number of jobs that have been created for 156 million tax-air money. They say no economic projection or impact statements wherever done for the project, but after weeks of refusing to provide any numbers for this radio story, they finally turned over a few. Let's do them. Maybe peer fö thought. He says they have 137 full-time and 451 part-time employees. These are the people who work for the peer itself, security people, parking maintenance, the Navy Pera Authority would not provide information on the salary ranges of its employees, or even a breakdown of employees' jobs. Pera Authority refused to allow us to interview any parent employees for this report. In addition to the Pera employees, there are 37 stores and restaurants located on the peer, and the very most weak figure, they employ 600 additional people, being the caretaker. total at most to 1200 workers. The government put $156 million into the fear that works out too, $130,000 per job at the very least and remember that more than half of these jobs are part-time. Well we had no idea if this was good or not. $130,000 per job created so we caught someone to find out. Joan Fitzgerald is a urban planner of the great cities. Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I would say it's a lot of money per job, per job, and particularly given that the number of those who are, because you're counting hard-crunched jobs in there. And chances are, those who are job, they shop clerk, so of course they were not touched, they were going to be a job. It's very hard. Jim Fitzgerald says it used to be common. That's great. , we've played that game in front of our country. You can now I feel  I'm reading, exactly. I'm going to try to read  myself. It's irresistible. Once you play that marketplace music, it has an effect on you that's so profound. Alright. Jump, it's your own. , it's friends at home. I just want you to try this yourself. Get a copy of it. Dave McPanna, we're in the money and Google are finding it instead of friends , but that's not even going that. And then play this thing. And I swear you start to read  David Broncachi on marketplace. Why is it going to be good? That's what I'm going to do with this section. John Fitzgerald says it used to be common to go from means to create jobs for 10 or 12,000 dollars per job, but there's been a bidding word of Poland employers and businesses, $130,000 per job is high, but still a fraction. What Alabama just spent to get a Mercedes-Benz plan. And John Fitzgerald says that if Navy peer helps bring poorest to the city and convention business and hotel business, then the investment makes more sense. You can't just look at each project in and of itself, you have to look at it as part of a broad. there, poor, without a contract. Chicago City officials  Greg Longini, Assistant Commissioner, and Department of Planning Development. Would prefer if we would not try to come up with a fair job cost at all. Here. That's really not. Crazy, would look at the question. The project was not the great job. What was the purpose of the project? The project was to store a civic landmark the treasury and  restoring the alliance building. FAW on it. a job generating a reprimially in a clinical project. So there was no notion that the idea of this was to bring some sort of business or help business in Chicago. Well, I think that that's not the case, but the spike, you don't want the number of jobs created by the investment doesn't make sense. So how should we evaluate the success of failure of me? I think we should evaluate the success for various Native people on how it's viewed by the students that are hard to help me people. visit the place what people think about it whether or not it adds to the image of Chicago as a good place to live in a good place to visit or not. Well my friends, we've got some very beautiful little kids out here in the audience. We want to ask all of the little ones to come up and join us here on our stage because we want to sing this next song directly to you guys. So come on up here and stay in the right place. In middle of the 18th year, maybe here near the McDonald's and oh, yes, Chicago. A strolling true backpack with singers of Maybetecareplaceers. who's cute 3 and 4 year olds from a crowd that remembers about 60. If it weren't for kids, have you ever thought and wouldn't be Santa Claus? Look what the story just got between. The three children being held in various singers arms and laps stare blankly in the middle distance. Each of the Navy peer players stress as a different character. Lead Scissors!! of their style sports band. There's Mrs. O'Glory whose house was the start of the Chicago fire. There's a cheerleader in a nerdy college boy, a guy in a mock suit suit and a wide-drem hat, a sailor girl, and a female character whose gimmick is simply that she likes shopping. They do four shows a day, five days a week, and they work up a sweat, all that crap, dancing and singing. Seeing them belt out a knock-up-hallow rendition of say, Fokini and Rhapsody in the food court to a group of tourists and stunt-working children, you do not think this is an easy job. Anything but. So, let's go to America! This next song is that's one of the page we're here at Navy Pier. Hut 2, 3, 4, Hut 2, 3, 4! After the performance I spoke with this woman, the one in the cellar costume. She carries an American flag and after every answer gave me a little salute. Yeah, we're in a Japanese restaurant playing the piano. I started a little production company called Two City Productions, and this is the French show, is that? The piano lessons. Yeah. And right now, this is one of many, you just salute it. Yeah. One of many jobs that you have right now. What this is my primary job. 350 people auditioned for these eight jobs. You may not be the greatest money in the world, but there aren't many full-time jobs for actors and singers in Chicago. And if two Navy crew officials stand by and make sure no one's sitting in a procreate, she said she was glad to get to work. Money is honey, where can my honey be? Money is honey, where can my honey be? If I had my money, my honey would be here with me. I won't drop this. morning my girl said I'm through get to self some money now come back to you money is ready where can my honey be in my money my honey would be yeah with me well funding for this program is been provided by the John D. and Katherine team of Clark Foundation he was with the Cheney Foundation the National Endowment for the Arts and the members of WPE Z.
