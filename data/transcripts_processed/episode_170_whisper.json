  "text": "Come Hodgkin's one of those get tough on crime politicians. Or a public, it's pointed to job share by a Republican governor. The Sunnisy became sheriff, Mr. County Messages. What right to work in the county jail? Before he came and we had no control over this jail. The inmates have controlled with the jail. Each English girl. Carlos Guerrero has worked in the jail for 10 years, says Sheriff Hodgkin has disciplined on the inmates and guards, Greenburger's threats had brought classers to the court. Three weeks now. they wanted their time, parents, their time. You removed TV from the sense. You removed the weight, power sessions around the town office. I felt this office right here, this is usually a weight room right here where we were. He removed all that because the hand in bed no sense to for us to make people charged with crimes, to make them even stronger than when they come in. I remember before hand that we used to have with question. every single difference between inmates who wanted to come to this system. This was the occasion where all of the people do whatever they want, everything was born five, no, it's the other way around, everybody wants to leave this chair, they don't ask to do it. So there was a strip of the situation, within the laws. But not only have to share parts in two copies in 1997. How is Carrera started to tell about something going on at the jail? It seemed terribly up. There was a new immigration law put into place just a year before, sentencing lots of people deportation who had never been eligible for deportation for this. Here's your thoughts. When I go to the Strava obviously, one of the things that is fundamental, we believe that of course, the relationship that skills justice but not the balance. So, if I see that somehow the law is being applied in the balance way, then it's a shame on me if I don't step up in. and try to correct that. First of all, there is certainly Francis Drung driving, for example, that Iron 96 was not a portable fan, so today we would be portable phones. In fact, any crime that got a sentence of a year in London was suddenly bad enough to get you to court it. You did not have a citizenship. Drung driving, theft, minor drug possession charges. All of these kids are not getting. person deported. But what made this especially severe was that it was retroactive. If you permitted these crimes, heck it's served your time in a model community member ever since. Suddenly, you could be thrown out of the country. If, for example, someone say in the early 20 years old, it's arrested to don't drive and got a year for the probation or jail. The Minister of Corpation was the only run-in with the law they had. In that it's 20 or years old, sets you get married. Has a job responsible, pays taxes, has a couple of children and now the kids have four and five result, a lot in 96 log kicks in the change in the law. Person decides, in my son's three years old, my daughters have five. I'm going to go ahead and get my citizenship. Or perhaps they were about changes in the law. The head of the country is getting tougher on green card holders. I should finally get my citizenship. I'll get it down to you. patients have studied that. When they get there, voluntarily reply. They run their background checking found out that 15 years earlier, this person got arrested, dropped driving. I and S says, I'm sorry, we're shipping it back to where up. That to me is a law that clearly is on the first hand. The person had done their time. They volunteered to go get this citizenship here now that they've taken away from this incident. So this law in order to Republicanist, fan of Southern deposition, calling for Congress to change a law that he thinks is too harsh as frappable Washington DC, the Latin legislatures. And for the people in his jail who are awaiting deportation, he's brought in teachers, prepared them for the new lives of receipts. The government was missing the law, spent the dollar. So what about the dollar, what about the dollar, what about the dollar? Mr. County happens to be home to a large Portuguese population, which has seen over what, at least a foot in England? quarter to the last four years in this new law. And then he gave him 35 to 40 people being held in the county jail, and us to the wedding to be the quarterback in Portugal. Okay, I suppose I should put that straight. Okay. Very amount of data, stops the Portuguese money went to a desk for inmates, and explains to them how much each coin and bill is worth in the country that they will soon be the quarter two, unless to them, a country that haven't even seen since they were small children. And all things done in Portuguese so they can get some practice submitted by the others. What's the have done for me? Remember seeing this money before. Yeah, totally. So, our hair, a reto-expect to be shipped overseas, any Dana. We had looking money, so this color is coins. , you're a cinematic in dollar bill, . I am lost in that. For hair reto, came to America when he was two years old. Now he's 25. He's no angel. He's addicted to heroin. While about being a story, he got to a fight, not duty cop. It was the second time he was convicted of an assault charge. New sense. year, which he served, that was enough to result in the quotation at 96. If you  your signature, then it would happen to you. I feel  I should have been punished somewhat, not punished for the rest of the matter. No, that's how I take it. That's how I was alive, something to me. They punished me for this. I feel as if I'm in a case, and if someone does their time is committed to any kind of sentence, what they've done in that should be the punishment. I know that that's it. I'm going home to start and just wait for what is done. I'm going home to just film. Why should we out of the country? We'll be sent to a part of Portugal where it's family's from. We have got parents in the name. I'll do it. What do you picture when you picture what it's ? What do I picture? Let me see the video here. If all of a sudden it was out there since... I know it. They punch me , ? I really don't have to live in the city all my life. what I mean? I watch this video and there's people writing on donkeys and Milton cows and stuff. That's something I've never done. I drink, load from the fridge and I write it around in the car. I can't pitch myself on the donkey. Milton cows and stuff. It's going to be hard to adapt. I guess I got more choice. I'm just curious. Stay in our program, stay at a little now, and how to speak. did one community in Massachusetts. We live in a big enough country that there are actually lots of laws to obscure it for most of us to a herd of, which actually affect tens of thousands of lives in huge, huge ways. Today we hear about one of them. To integration law, the immigration service itself says it's unfair. Most of the laws original sponsors in Congress now said they went to farm, they were too harsh when they passed the law. And yet, most of the laws keep provision still stand unchanged and unchanged. Gav buys officials from municipal organizations and commodities. We do think the WBM통DIS is the best. I hope it will speak to the Education iki government and provides my stiplatents a little bit. We will include all these services such as EMB, provider. We can do it. to American life, America, and us. That's one of our show today. Where goes the neighborhood? We hear how the immigration law of 1996 has a community of non-political people reluctantly going to protest and the meetings of night talking to politicians doing all sorts of things. Most of us would do anything to avoid. That too, whose idea was this anyway. Congressman Barney Frank argues that most of his colleagues had no idea what they were going for when they wrote it for key portions of this law. And they had to get for the rights. plans why we should want to report more people. Back three, man without a country, what happens if the immigration service wants to report you for the country that you come from won't take you back, under current law, usually, just stay in jail. In definite. That looks hot, what's up, it's just a straightened Texas, this is an action packed hour. Let's stay with us. Back one, where it goes to neighborhood. On the 1996 immigration on Hickton-Dew effect, the number of people deported President Criminal Pass double, about 30,000 people a year to about 60,000. Two-tons and Massachusetts, fall river and new bedfrood were especially hard hit, because the large Portuguese community there, many newcomers, which mostly comes from the Portuguese island called the Aizores, Smith and I, who's shabby, spend time there recently, talking to people that passed on. Mario Fratus is the kind of dad who's learned. to tune out the fact that there's a five-year-old, but one-and-a-half-year-old, and a recently born baby, all wanting attention, as he tries to talk to me in his living room. He came to this country 19 years ago when he was 17, from the Aslers, the islands off of Portugal. He and his wife Maria show me pictures, one from 1980. That was when we came to this country. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.' This is my, my old book. and this was a friend of us who was already here from Boston. So that was it. Yes. Mario's  most of the people in this community who faced deportation under the 96th immigration law. They came here from Portugal in the 70s and children with their families to escape the Salas art dictatorship. They were legal immigrants with green hearts. Typically they got involved with drugs or alcohol and got in trouble with the law for drug from driving trouble. possession, domestic violence, and minor assault charges. Mario was convicted of cocaine possession with intent to distribute when he was 24. He served a three-year sentence. He was released in 1991. And after his parole, he didn't think about his crime all that much until one morning last year. I was going to work out working boss in my normal. Just a regular day. what I'm doing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We walk out. side and I just get my truck over here just right inside get my coffee my bagel just my my is again to work  make some money back it up and then just a regular back up when I reach that back car right there he points to a car or half a block away what 150 feet and I see a police guy coming in the corner where he sees that tree coming this way. He pulled over, I think in the police were there for someone else. And suddenly officers appeared on both sides of his trap. They opened my right door, my left door, and pulled the guns, all over, so I can't move. I can even put the gear in them. So then he did the gear for me. Put emergency brake. Take me out of the trap. I just, I told you, kid. happen. I told him to stick, . They didn't defy himself, , say that's immigration. And you be going to Portugal next week. Now in my this country, think about Portugal. Because I was in shock, , I mean, I have my family, my kids sleeping over here, 150th of a way. So I was not too happy. It's still not clear why they came from him that particular realm. What brought his case up on their radar? They put him in a van and drove him into Boston. Right past his actual job site. The laser concrete on the massive tunnel highway construction project that's called the big dip. I thought it was a bad dream, . I go by my job, , I think that I should be over there. I'm not supposed to be on all those problems, . I'm not supposed to be on all those problems. I was asleep when my next one had a call and said, I took your husband. This is Maria Freida, Smarias White. And I knew in my heart that it was immigration to have already had rid of a few cases, so when she said immigration, that my first reaction was to one outside, something is still outside, but you have to be able to take it away. So the only thing I could do was I got into the truck. And his coffee was still sitting in hot coffee in a warm bagel. And I took the truck and he parked it into the yard. Inside a calling family. I think the worst part was my daughter. She was a time-for. That was hard to work. She had to keep her dad and dad dying. So why is this people here? This is the morning. And why you crying is nothing she ran through the windows. That's that straw. The daddy died and I said, no, daddy didn't know. She just did. And I said, no, we did, and she said, yeah, my dad died. The INS held him for 20 days, and then his lawyer got him out on a technicality. A year later, he's still waiting for a final decision about whether he'll be sent to Portugal. As you've heard, the 1996 Law did a few things. It made a lot of crimes to Portugal that weren't affordable. before. It was retroact applying to crimes that happened years before it was written. And it did one more thing, and it's this third change that's probably had the most effect on this community and the country. It removed judges from the process. Before the 1996 law, Mario would have had the right to appear before a judge, who would examine the specifics of his case, take into account the fact that he hadn't had other arrests and that his apparent of three children with a job and a house. and then decide whether deserves to be supported. Fred Blatt is an attorney and new banker whose handled dozens of these cases, including Marians. I think the part the easiest way to understand the changes in the law is to understand that what's the new law or law of business, the big differences of now the judges do not have the discretion in many cases to give away with the deportation. Fred Blatt. God wants us that if they had that discretion, well over half of his clients might have had a decent shot at staying in the US. Before the changes in the law, that's how many of his clients won their cases in the judges. As it stands now though, all sorts of cases lead to deportation, more or less automatic. I never knew this thing is going to happen. Because I'm not a criminal. I can say to myself, I'm not a criminal. My problem was doing. Luis Ramos is 48, did construction and manufacturing work, and served a sentence for drunk driving. Before 1996, a judge might have taken away his driver's license and ruled that he posed no further danger to the community. Now the INS is planning to be court. Another go-round robber house is something  that enough. How work in this country for 32 years, 32 years, and ever rob nobody at least. pre-attacks as a government. , I never heard no one, I'm 18 years married to kids. Wow. Never did nothing to hit the American. You've that bird and fall river are both really pretty port towns, with cobblestone, colonial-looking downtowns, and small houses on streets winding back from the waterfront. And Portuguese immigrants often come here. in the 1790s because this was a major wailing town, and the Portuguese islands, the A-sours, were full of wailers as well. A section of Moby Dick where Ishmiel meets up with wailers from all over the world is set in New York. This is the kind of place where it seems  every little store and doctor's office has a Portuguese name, and where many first-generation Portuguese immigrants never learn to speak English. Over half of the population is a Portuguese descent. At this point there have been so many deportations, the women's group was formed here, made up of mothers, sisters and wives of men who have been deported to Portugal. They hold a monthly support group, and weekly visuals in downtown New Bedbrook. They dress in black and carry signs protesting deportations. Last month they held a speaker's forum in a fall river church, where women were invited to tell their stories and politicians were invited to come and listen in our Shah place. I would also  to recognize Maria Costa who's representing Protestant and the government. About a dozen politicians showed up for sent their aids, most of them state and local representatives who can't do much about the federal immigration law. The women go up to the podium first, unease a few sisters, a wife, several mothers, and each one gets a few sentences into a first story about someone's deportation and starts to cry. Rest. the new everybody. My name is Jo Koudam. I come to be you to talk about my brother, no good Susan, he's in a jail for nine months. So I'm so confused. And I'll cry and I'm really the airport to learn. paper, you're very sweaty… My name is citron, I was speaking on behalf of Moments. My husband. But even I inherited my brother's name. It came to the US at the age of twenty-half. This is the first political involvement of any kind that most of these women have ever had. But the number of deportees has grown and affected more and more families. Even not very civic minded people are becoming outraged. The M. Lorinko is a new bad for fishermen. a sea scalper. He was taken to Louisiana by the INS and detained for 15 months. After which his immigration case was decided in his favor, thanks to a lot of fancy footwork from the slower. He says his time away from home was especially hard on his two sons. Here's the Sunday day during school and stuff. There was a lot of things that I noticed about them they've changed where they used to ,   all business firemen policemen. How I'm going to be there when I go up. We had a different day with sending pictures of cops and killed. , I really cared much. They lost some of the respect I. They knew I was being held for no crime or crime that I already had committed in paid for. So there was no reason for me being there. I think that's what I was saying. Lily and Roddrix is raising her three kids allowance. and some husband was deported a year ago, and they're not doing so well. While we're talking, William's youngest child comes in. Her eight-year-old son, Derek. He went with her to visit his father and Portugal this summer. She pulls his roller blades off on him. The three of them are not because they came in school day. They just hadn't met in with the principal from his school. They told me since he's since we came back home. I'm seeing the spider. He's had major, all it. He's  the principal said he's acting out on that. Because he's a child, all he doesn't know, had a, put his feeling, so this is where he's bringing on his feelings with the school, and that's what's happening with my other two. So when they changed the law, then he finished, then he finished. in the children. In the 1996 immigration law was passed in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and the World Trade Center bombing. It sponsors hope to combat terrorists and to stop what they thought were million immigration judges from allowing so many convicted felons to stay in the U.S. Immigration Lawyer Fred Watt. I don't think the average Republican or Democrat was aware of what this law was going to do. I'm not even sure that people who wrote it had a full understanding on it because it took months for the immigration law community to understand it. I don't think that they necessarily meant to affect the number of people who did. And I'm not saying that they said it's because the number of them seemed to get it the longest time. We did year and the judges and the fire were all. scratching their heads. Let's see, Bowling Pacton's a clock in clear. Here's one sign that Congress didn't intend to come out to work the way it has. There's a bill right now to soften some aspect of the law. Back to my most of the original sponsors of the 96 law, and written by one of its key sponsors, Republican Bill McCollum of Florida. It passed the house and is awaiting a Senate vote right now. It would allow some people who've been deported by your last degree to return. Fred Watts says it would help about a third of his clients. It won't affect any of the people we saw on the Bristol County jail for Lillian Rodgerick's husband or Mario Cratus. It won't do the thing opponents of the 96 law want most. Put these deportation cases in front of judges again as they were before 1996. And I think it is time that people thought about deportation from what it is. Really. It's almost  a... little death penalty case every time do one. That's maybe a little bit melodinata, but we'll see the family took him mothers. This is about the worst thing that can happen. I asked Mario for it. The guy who was named because Bago and Coffee still sitting in his truck for a tour of his house. After he and Maria had married a couple of years. He bought this old two-story house that was completely run down, condemned in fact for a really cheap price. This is a brand new picture was a old one here, so I take on down, I did the floor tile. I take all the walls up, , I pull me, no election, flummer, let insulation, no. The house is beautiful, on a quiet street and other houses that look , these got plans to fix the basement. Peace. sometimes he relaxes in the backyard, daydreams about what he'll be with his life. And then he remembers all of the sudden how tenuous his future is, and he's still waiting for a final decision from INS. I'm just thinking maybe in our next week I get to call out who knows, and just think it, they come get me tomorrow, I don't know, no I always be behind my mind, no stops me, you say,  why I'm trying to do this? Because I don't know what's going to happen to me, it's  a marvellous thing. Mario shows me a panoramic photo of the island where he comes from in the A-Zores. Lush green firmly under all directions, and he points to the spot where he'll move back to if he gets deported. He says it's a very small town with no industry other than farming. I ask him if he thinks if himself is an American and he says no, he knows he's watching these. He says he's just built a life here and had planned. on living here forever,  a lot of other people do. We're shabby. Coming up, the US Congressman caused the Congress stupid that's our ex-stupid. 9.0 and official says that the pastor imposed a lot of sun fair. And other examples of your government work, in a minute, public getting international and our program. This American life on my earth glass, but you can't do it! program of course we choose some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that day's show and obscure a lot probably have not heard of this reporting tens of thousands of people. We've wrapped it up to a virtual, act to whose idea does this anyway. This far in our program we've been hearing about 1996 changes to the immigration law that law of course is enforced by the immigration and naturalization service and at this point the INS officially opposes certain parts of the 90. six immigration act even while it uses them to keep people out of country. The Straussberger has a spokesperson for the agency in Washington, D.C. I think it's said that INS deals that the law went a little too far, although we were pleased with a number of the things that were included in the law. It's ours, it was overreaching in many ways. It was probably the best compromise that we were able to talk about in what ways did it go to the bottom of this. Theð wasting through. of the law reaching back, analyzing those who were convicted previously. I think the biggest problem is that we really have educated the greatest change is in the lack of discretion we now have that immigration, which I just now have. I and I would  to see a return to that discretion to allow immigration judges to review the totality of someone's life. That's exactly where they were convicted of them relatively minor events. 15 years ago, let's say. It strikes me that I and S is in odd situation of having to enforce it, it doesn't agree with right now. Well that's quite often the case in law enforcement. The old phrase is, I don't write the law just for some, and in many ways that's true in this case, we give our input for Congress, those past the law, for some signs of bill, and then we have to enforce it. This traspirip, Giene Ines. Meanwhile, legislators are hard at work, back pedaling on the law, as you've heard one of the original sponsors of the 1996 Act. I'm some of them come on the Florida. It's drafted a new bill that undoes some of the more controversial parts of the 1996 law. Ask representatives to prove the measure is still awaiting the website Senate. But as it waits, the question is, why did they pass the 1996 law in the first place, so that they now want to fix? What were they hoping to accomplish? It's a case of outrageous. were, subtly being made in an outrageous way to seek group. This is Congressman Beiney, Frank. All of those Portuguese people, fall river and new bedford that we heard earlier in the program, there is some stitch ones. They look at his district. And so he supports this new Macallum bill, which versus part of 96 law. Back in 1996, he was on the House Committee the Handle of the Integration Bill. And he says that to understand how the most controversial parts of the bill came off, it's to just want most of the pages. Follow us. Retroactivity. He says the committee considered a puzzle that would make the Puffer immigration standards retroactive. Now when they offered that in the committee, we were able to fake them. We were probably going to smoke things around you, but it's so bad that almost all of them were gradually coupled with Puffer against Rebell. The bill, without retroactivity, went forward, has the Senate approved it. And then comes the procedure that Bonnie Frank is just calling outrageous, a conference committee that's members of the House and the Senate. it in exactly me, in normal way. The final bill was written by the Republicans in a conference committee, which never met, but away the Democratic excluded, the Republican leadership of the two committee wrote the bill. They put in that provision that had been defeated by vote of committee, the provision that said, you will retroactively beat the portable automatic leadership client, had not previously carried that. And then they put it into the armed push of population bill that year. This is the bill that funds all of government activities. Exactly. Or most of it. Now, the immigration bill had been voted on. How, to the Arabian Senate, separate. But at that time, these are not provisions. But right to our typically won't end it. They were added by the Republican Congressional leadership in a grassmanate secret meeting. And corporate and the overall bill, so they would never anything as to vote on. We're back. this course in after yourself that you actually were aware that this thing had been put back in. Oh yes, yes, because I was a member of the house senate conference committee that never met and we insisted finally in the Democrats on a meeting but that's the meeting no motion for a while. The rules of the house and the Senate rather do that. And they explained that they were doing this. We complained about it and we objected very stringuously. But the problem was that the first place, other parts of the immigration building was tracked. But even more so we have any separate moments. We just part of it. the one overall pack. Now when this passed, did legislators understand that they were passing? Most did not unfortunately, and most members did not know that the ultimate bill they were voting for included this I've not just been ready, but they were public leadership, but it stipulates that they were able to do a new. Now, so you have this new bill. Just now, what was the last slide? That's out. What was the change? It under most of the bill. effects but not all of the retroactivity. And also says very importantly, it might insist that if you have already been deported because of this and you can show that you would not have been deported had the law not been so okay, you can't come home. So the nice thing is that we're doing the way with retroactivity retroactive, common sense of convection to the question. What I understand is that what's going through in this part of a decision said it doesn't give judges discretion again for these cases since this. Since 1996, it does not, as I said, it only repealed the retroactive. Why does it Congress just let the immigration judges look at the case? Well, one of the two asked the people who do it. I thought of stupid and cool then. I still think it is. I apologize, I can't tell you what. I really, I am not a good explainer of other people's bad mistakes and even intentions. I have enough trouble with my own. Congressman Bonnie Frank. We invited the key Republican legislators, and in 1996, to come to our program and explain why that? was necessary in the first place. Off for Congressman Lamar Smith, Texas, Bill Com, Florida, and Patta Romanoi, and Senator Spence Abraham of Michigan, all the kind are interviewing class, saying they were too busy at the end of the legislative session in the fall elections. So to understand better, while we as a nation might want, it's not to be a CEO of President Obama, we turn to an organization called Pair, Federation for American Immigration Reform, which strongly supported the United States law, and still stands by it. We're talking about immigrants to this country who have not become US citizens, of course, simply living here under our laws as guests either invited or uninvited. This is Jack Martin, Director of Special Projects. We certainly have felt that it is fair that an active effort was undertaken for removing people who have abused the possibility of our society. Let's start. of our producers met a man named Mario Fradis who was making drug charges served two years, got at 1991, the Green Cartholder. Kondab, that's the founding, kids now works in the big digging Boston, didn't he already pay for his crime? What good does it do to deport him? There are many cases that receive publicity of people. such as the one you're referring to who have committed a, what may seem a fairly minor of mass. And even though they have paid a debt to society under the law, if they were, if they had just come into the country after the 96 athletes, they would be deportable at the time that they had paid their service. In other words, we have judged these people to this point. and the same Flint State as Aaron, and I should be moved back to the country that they came for. And I think that you can make a reasonable case for people in certain limited circumstances where they've demonstrated that they are responsible members of the society to sustain this country. But the Attorney General's discretionary power under the law is amply sufficient for taking care. of these exceptional cases. In other say, attorney general can overturn these cases and basically say these people shouldn't be deported. That's correct. That's correct. When I just have judicial, when I just have immigration judges, look at the cases where it was before somebody's been hit with way merits of each case. Well, the main reason for that is because that lends itself to judicial shopping, which was a standard practice in one of the main abuses in the 1996. was intending to correct. A lot of immigration lawyers wanted to give me free reign to shop around from judge to judge during a very lengthy and extensive appeal process that ended only when they were able to find a judge finally who would agree to forgive the offense and allow that person to stay in country. Tech Martin, Federation for American. immigration reform. He's exactly right by the way that the Attorney General has the power under current law to stop deportation anybody, which thinks it's a certain. General Reno, Kiddishu in order allowing Mario Freitas or any other potential deportees to stay in the US. But the INS itself has the power to look the other way in any case and not deport somebody. But someone's never done. Possibly this is why. If Janet Reno, or the INS, hardened somebody, he then went on to- the terrible crimes. The attorney general and her party and its candidates, they are the ones who take blame. Now the Republicans say that it's just fine, if something bad happens, politicians should take blame. And Republican congressmen  Lamar Smith have been saying for years now, that INS does not need a new law. It should just make exceptions for those cases that merit. Ask Bernie Frank what he thought about his colleague saying. of the rupture himself. If you go back to the debates in 1996, their argument was precisely that they had to take away the discretion from the ANS. Then when that war began to have outrageous results, they said, oh, so an awful thing, the ANS should have used this discretion, but they were very purposeful, I was taking away the discretion. what the argument is? Well, the ANS in effect should ignore the war's cycle. Even though the war says these people should automatically be supported, the ANS should simply refuse to invoke it in these places. No, I think that's probably proven on these places, but don't personal wars. 枉 the onion ash for carrying up all the U.S. and say, well, therefore, the should be good. One last political note, contacted the two presidential, and I got where they stand for the 96th anniversary. Of course, in this scheme of presidential politics, this is not a very big issue. And, in fact, the Bush campaign does not have the official position on law. The Goer campaign does, Henry Corp. is the 96th. So I went too far and babies putting these guys back in the hands of judges. You sure got a climb a lot of sense to get this capital going here in Washington. But I wonder who that said little scrap of paper is. I'm just a few. Yes, I'm only a few. And I'm sitting here and I can't but don't hear. Well, it's all. Long long journey to the capital city. It's a long long wheat while I'm sitting in committee. But I know I'll be alone someday. Please don't over and pray that I'll agree. Man without a country. This next story is about another little known part of US immigration policy. What happens if the INS wants to report you? But there is nowhere to deport you too. People are waiting deportation by the way, the capital town of Jels. And it can be there for a long time. long time. Alex Kotowitz has this story about the unusual relationships that sometimes form between these deportees and a jealous. On a recent Friday night in Victoria Texas, a blue-collar town of 60,000, I met up with fun tram. Chong is a Vietnamese immigrant and he driven the two hours from Houston where he works as a lab technician in the sleep disorder clinic. He's 33, broad-shouldered, handsome and well-dressed in a sapphire blue shirt, tacky pants, and Tommy. for her boobs. Together we drove to the home of Virginia Eskihido, when her husband moved her. Virginia had met Tron when she was a guard, a local jail, and Tron was an inmate. Virginia was 45 as a short-roundish woman, red hair, and rose and cheap. She feels somewhat maternal for its Tron, and when we arrived she embraced him. Hi! Hi, you doing Tron? Virginia hold on Tron's thick black hair. I was ... It turns her. The seat fits in the grayer, because it was jet black in the jail when I met him. And he was so skinny and I was kind of worked with him for a while and now he's his cheeks are chunky and he's got a little gray hair. He's probably talking about the more. Then he looks good. I'm glad to see him. This is the story of an unlikely friendship. The ship between tap-burn capture. The connection. Push both in the American and an immigrant to question their place in America. This tale begins in 1975 when Trongon's family fled Vietnam for America. Trong was seven times his motherhood worked for the U.S. military. The trans eventually settled in Houston where Trong's parents bought in Rana convenience store. Trong quickly adapted to his new country. In high school, he ran track on weekends he attended Friday night football dreams and afterwards Join classmates in Kentucky, Brighton. his date for the problem with the hum coming queen. Those he hung out with he says were all Americans. He had no Vietnamese friends. Just lived since he had left a tip on American tea and a girl been placed through us and we just grew and do the whole nine years. I would see the evening chat and talk to them, and she wouldn't hold that lift. And I would agree to tell some of the things. And the whole time I'm graduate from high school. It would work on ice cream looking with your own mouth, everybody in the woods can bepped down a lot. I will be doing something new here, awesome for all our staffs. the whole thing  I probably threw up my financial aid paper and anything else I'll put that to you as soon. Strong enough to college it takes a southern university and very lost his footing. His grade slipped and the scholarship was resented. He began to sell crack cocaine. He was pretty good at it, netting $500 to $1,000 a week. On October 19 1992 he was arrested and charged with drug trafficking in money laundering. He pled guilty to both counts. Some surf 30. months in federal prison. But when his time was up, he wasn't released. Strong in fact was not a citizen, though he was a lawful permanent resident. While he had begun the application process, he never competed. Given the serious nature of Trump's crime and the fact that he was not a citizen, an immigration judge could and did decide to deport him. But there was a catch. The atonement is one of the number companies including Cuba, Cambodia and Laos, which won accept the port. individuals. So, Trong was about a homeland, the Anand and I'm not in the U.S. So, what to do? The INS policy has been to keep people  Trong and Carcery even though they can be the their criminal services. The INS St. Trong can be county jail and move on to those taxis. So, you tell you truth at first, when I was in the INS detention, it was cat mouths named the two of the officers and the inmates. And we have a lot of slaves. to the set that the military said, what? So, they were met on the calmest level, the least season  that. When they say it's dark on the other side, here we were at least a bit of food. Then in May of 1997, Trong was transferred to the county jail in Victoria. Trong had no reason to respect he betrayed any different fare. The building itself is an imposing two-story, cinder block structure and  most counties. Jails was built to hold inmates for only short stretches, anywhere from a few hours to a few months, while they awaited their trial or their sentence. The jail doesn't allow television. The only outdoor facilities are two courtyard, each the size of a basketball park. Inmates are allowed outside for a total of three hours in the evening. Inmates have no privacy. They are no cells, just dormitory style lock rooms, which has anywhere from Fort 24 prisoners and bunk beds. place two. facilities  this designed for locking people up temporarily, to which the INS sends those  Trong, who mits detaining indefinite periods. There are roughly 4,000 such detainees which publicly the INS refers to as long-termers, in which internally the agency is called Life-Rers, a suggestion that this could be their permanent home. At Victoria Trong shared a cell with Julio Marto. Julio, who was a legal permanent resident as well, emigrated from Cuba, committed a crime, served six months and was then ordered to court it. But Cuba won't take him back, so he was placed in the Victoria County jail in Defa. I've done a personal article, can I go on with some blues? There are some people who were sentenced here to two years, then they let them out. They come back here, committed another crime, they serve their time, they let them out, and now back at the third time, and they'll come back here in the ass. when you're going to get out and they don't believe. It's up to Victoria County jail where Trong met Virginia. Virginia was a jail guard responsible for the institution's educational program. Many of the detainees attended language classes, so they were teller of their situation. How could someone be in jail and not know when they were getting out? She would ask for them. She was puzzled. Because they are no no no no. No release date. There's no release date for them. And everybody's got a release date here. Except I and S. And it was just unreal. I couldn't comprehend that. At the moment, someone has been, I'm in the wrong job. , I'm just in the wrong job. I mean, , because we're just so frustrating sometimes. And I felt , , I couldn't do it. enough for these people. Couldn't do enough. She began to call the IMS to try to get some answers, who the old Trong and the others. I think though she was also trying to make sense of it or so. I would ask, well, , what was their status? , they wanted to know and, , we wanted to know. Also, , you were just telling you that the things I should do. They could not tell me anything. Well, , I felt back. what rules I don't tell you guys, and there they were standing by me or sitting at this and waiting for an answer and they were so happy that I was making a call for them and then  for me to tell them  well they even talked to me other guards for you many of whom  Virginia are first and second generation Americans would equally perplex and so they too found ways to make life just a bit more there. for these ionist teams. The guards gave the lifers certain privileges and did so at some rest. The sergeant did a nearby jail with spy relief. She publicly questioned the policy to teaming the movement in some death memory. The guards of Victoria made many of them trusty which allowed them some freedom of movement in jail. They were assigned to kitchen duty, sort of mocking floors on the case of trauma to the GEP program. Virginia looked out for some of these inmates in that's the families and so many years and they would ask me, Mr. Jin, my family has been seeing me in so long, they don't even know how do you think you could take picture of me? And maybe I should know, but I did, I took pictures of these guys and said I'm home. And I think somebody had won,' Kritchang' or you might remember my concern. So this everyone is seeing. air, , incarcerate and go near the D-Lawary-Dendor time. They were small favors, but they showed a level of trust that doesn't ordinarily exist between Garden Prisoner. Some deputies would bring back an extra hamburger or sandwich from lunch to get to the net. Teachers at the jail gave a life-truth email account so they communicated their attorneys. Now, allow the Maxis to the Internet so they could keep over the changes in immigration hunter-TV. One detainee, Victor Altman, who served 16 years for kidnapping and aggravated battery, charges stemmed from a bar fight, became the chef of the jail. The deputy sheriffs were such fans that they bring Victor along to their Monday night softball games, where he'd grow for them their favorites, the heaters, hot dogs and hot dogs. Victor was so well- that when he went to a local hospital for emergency heart surgeon, so many deputy sheriffs visited him. The hospital staff for a P2 was in law. A jail officer allowed Trong and five other lifers, including Julio, to room together. And the guards found ways to get the INS between these outside for more than your laundry to be out. Well, one time we went out and painted that mirror. And I was shocked and this was a genocide. When  you don't have a civilian, we got through from the INS. Please don't mind. And I was scared when I first took Trong. I was holding a quote, I'm going to run on me track. I can run that fast. I'm not going to run after you. And I'm, , it's going to be my job because they told me if he runs, it'll be your job. For Trong and the others, it was a clear and sudden human of the guards. About a year and a half ago, under pressure from immigrants' rights groups, the INS began reviewing the civil rights groups. That's the agency determined that the detainee was not... danger to society or flight risk, you can sit at release in them. The only way in the trauma the others can show that is by recommendations from those moving best for tapers. And indeed the jail guards wrote letters to the INS, urging them to release his note. One sergeant wrote them to have a victor of the cook. When victor leaves his jail, he will be misguided in poise. Many of us depend on him. The only complaint I have are victors who is a little heavy of the drama. A dozen other guards in jail staff wrote them to have other bikinis, including Puliah and Trauma. And after two and a half years in the deep-fanty detention, Victor who's now 53 was released. And someone at the jail opened their jaw as chef, a small local seafood restaurant. Victor still volunteers his culinary skills at the guards in Monday night soft ones. From July of last year, the Iiness Grief. to reduce strong after four years in debt and detention. His family team up with $15,000 a bomb. The INS determined he was no longer a danger or a flight risk. Charming it expected to get out of a fried, but an INS agent team by two days early and told Charming to pack his stuff. He wasn't quite ready to leave though. He first wanted to pass along some of the computerized records he could keep in jail for his HERJOO So I'll say, hey, I'm not a businessman. We're here, yeah. I won't, at that time, I was so involved with the GD stuff up there and I took care of all the paperwork to stuff. And I want to show everything, try and go. So let me get the script. So here they tell you you're free. And you say, no, I want to stay in jail for the next few days. So I can help out the guards and the teachers. Yeah, I want to go home, but then I also want to finish my job by Lee. I don't know. I got very close. We work for a long time. But again, Virginia is given. And still, we see each other and he tries to stop by once and a half. And I just, I love him. And there's several other of the guys that write to me and send me letters. And I've kept every piece of mail from them. I've got it cheap. Virginia goes into her bedroom. Her merch is rather excitedly, very shallow plastic band. She kneels and spills the contents on her floor. She's held onto everything. There are a pile of letters from former IMS continues in drinking to made by Cubans. All of these are nettened by handcaches. Tron leems back in the couch, calmly smiley. Virginia's now a police officer in nearby town and she's still in uniform. She goes to sit next to him, he pokes him in the ribs. I'm glad you've put on some wage sauce, Dickwin. She cheeses him. that the female inmates in jail. He's got it. , grab or something  that. Soon another former guard might Martinez rise. In Virginia asked Trump about Louis on Trump's old son. The day before, Louis, or he marked the Spitthen of Versailles Victoria Jale, it's possible he could be there for the rest of his life. In the eyes of the I.S. The D.N.E.S. crimes, you're serious enough for the seams  a threat to society. It doesn't matter how long the sun is, or what he doesn't tell. It's on my way, for me. released. Julio is submitted testimonials from Jelsta, with the ionists turned them down. Possibly because the attempts are among the worst, from the ionists from the one. He is five convictions of smuggling legal realities. Sean visits him on occasion and recently sent him a gift, one which intentional or not or a message response. Up until we have good double bags of case that we can do it with the leaves, we have a back, deteriorate as ... I must strike. I didn't have enough back, I had two boxes full of leave with darkness and I was picked up in here by impression in Tuchisana, Tonyo and had to catch a great amount back to Houston and I here I am here to pass the paint about around. And it's all golden though, so I felt sorry for his, I couldn't find, I'm double back, it's another stuff. I'm not sure if he gets any kind of legal trouble. the INS consent in Dr. Chris, and if and when Vietnam reaches an expatriation agreement with the US, Trump would be deported. The experience has, and perhaps it was inevitable, altered Trump's perception of himself. He now considers himself the Admitings, not American. He reads a weekly Vietnamese newspaper and listens to the Admitings, he only eats the Vietnamese restaurants. He sends money when he can to his grandmother still lives in Saigon. With the exception of those in Medved Victoria, he only hangs out with other real music regrets and for the first time, he's dating with me. I do, I finally realized that I'm not that American too. I once thought I would, because that stats looked at me the way for me that I, hey, just a visitor here, that still can shut any good times. They'll have too much fun then, back to it. Virginia's journey is going to be quieter, but no less profound. Before I work back in the gym. know, I wouldn't question anything. I go along with, , okay, this is right. This is the law, this is America, this is the way it should be and now I'm going, , there's something wrong with it. But because it was just, it was just a shock to me, what they do to the inmates, this is the right way to do this. I am not, this is just, yes, they've made mistakes, but they've paid for those mistakes. Sometimes I think, well, good, good, good. We think we are, I'm happy. God, think. To keep these people up there, ,  this? Let's not write. Virginia is not alone. When I was at the Victoria jail, visiting Julio and the other team is a deputy sheriff who looked at the adaptor team up there. For you the one visiting the INS Christ he asked for a good roughly, I told him I was, he smiled, I just wanted to shake her hands and say thank you. Thank you. I'm a God, for doing the story on his prisoners. I do feel for these individuals who told me after all he said they served him. How it's always is the author of their Arnold Children's Hair, their books.
