  "text": "Andrea was working in the first time job. Bank American sentences go. Or any had to use the leaders. And she made this chart with Microsoft. So it's very professional looking. The line that goes across the bottom of the chart was the years between 1987 and 1987. The left side of this chart with my call to Y axis. List of numbers of people going from zero to seven. Is it legend? And the title is pop chart? I love it. that's in your spare. It's basically all the people on Dre have made out with or slept with over 10 years. And then once you laid out this way, in numbers, it's hard not to start to do that for stats. the huge jumps you made in 1994 from 3 to 7. So 7 was my first job. That was definitely my highest year. But then 95. followed up for which was hired and all the previous year. So I thought I thought at that time that I kind of broke a barrier and it was just going to be smooth from here on out and then 96 I had  another high with five 97 unexplainable in terms of triceps Sure 97 right number zero I think what explains it is I split six months living in all my mom Then there are the dramatic increases in 1994 and 1996 very big jumps. Andreas, what happened in those years? There are slutty years abroad. Well definitely leaving the country is. It brings my numbers up immediately. Me and David outlaw, better in Europe. So what I'll start is this funny thing to just try on the computer, kill time with. But it's on the way up, looked at the child. It was actually kind of reassuring. First of all, it made me look  such a choir, which she wasn't really singing at the time. And the second thing was that when you reduce people to just numbers, everything that was meaningful about your relations with them, just the pensions, person who pissed and it called you again, really embarrassed person who rather just would get it or happen, it's all gone. It is just numbers. And this way. people totally go away. I can't look at a year and think, oh that was that person, , whatever, because so many of these things on their own would be, I would, I would normally class-play as failures, projections, something painful, but when I look at it in the context of all this, now these are these are all my scores, these are my successes. So, it's about this. This is thing by numbers, we will easily deal with things. in the thousands and viguists and difficult things that happen in life real life. And so, today on our program, we can use stories of people who have tried to take me out, take emotional situations, take things that never should be expressed in numbers, and render the new rules. Well, from the BBEZ Chicago and public radio international, it is this American life from our class, on today's program Act 1, the story of one couple who decided to put that in corporate annual report. Bye. their own relationship. Back to pain find numbers, to artists who decided what to pain by hiring a polling firm. They asked people what they wanted to see in art. That's great. When days are numbered, Jerry Davidson of Worcester, Massachusetts is competing at least if everything he has done since 1955. But does not make it onto the list. There's no deal out bigger than what does. For salesmen, it has been priced to market himself. So what? Using all the tools of corporate brand marketing. Recive, break it down, tap the little plastic hose. Stay with us. Recline, it was called Bionner Report on Status of Relationship with Significant Other. And so why would any cup? Choose to analyze their relationship. Using the tools. graphs, methods, corporate and I think because it's seem the most emotionalist, I mean it's seem the most opposite of a relationship. So once we have here Trevor Scott and his boyfriend David, exactly, he's separately who would have questioned him, he measured the status of their relationship. He tried to be scientific and small, but six categories of evaluation. send him a moment first. His ability be back Profit of the film, which is what they've got on those security mergers, which is their charging sex line. A while, which in their case meant, gram, kittiness. Yeah, how him then you've thought by the relationship, did you fantasize about being single, did you have sex outside the relationship, things  that? So, let's move on to the structural thing. just the high-to-relationship to very  touchy, feely, , escape from an MSC code of you to see a sort of psychopathal kind of stuff. And I wanted to use something that didn't have that quite  monosoy, one fuzzy, hadn't feel to it, but something  very cold in the mood. And so I wanted to sort of take that a step further and line it to people and apply it to a relationship and apply something that called love and whatever. And does that work? Oh no, it's completely futile. I mean, I mean in all these pieces, we were sort of always trying to apply the most, , anesthetical structures and initially scientific, masculine, scientific method, hyper-invitical to the most irrational chaotic, emotional things in our lives. See, you say, it doesn't work well, what does it work well? What do you lose? Because it's chaos, it has benefits, but you have to forge the science a lot. I mean, it's, it, you're trying to quantify. to find things that are really hard to find. , , one thing that was really happened was when we were separated, and we were rating the section area. Some weeks I would give us really really high rating because I was thinking about day of a lot, essentially now, feeling very, I was  having a list of one-posing thoughts and everything. So I gave it a really high rating. Well, day of day that I complete zero because we were separated and we weren't having even a single point. But it just gets you into the problem. , how do you even quantify how much love is occurring to me? Yeah. Well, I mean, it was easy with things , , the phrase I love you. , I can easily count how many times that happens. But trying to determine, , exactly what was an unburble, what was special love? , every count, , gifts, , things  that. But then you count, , unaffectionate luck to count. , punching a shoulder and how would you kind of think  , you get your dinner and you can reach that into psychotist and Talk The way That that would be a debatable mom for all right But the negative's really hard because if you count  every instance physical expression is that when you're just in time Sometimes I'll touch as you Is it  how do you determine between it? See is he squeezing your hand because he loves you so much as the squeezing your hand She might say something is stupid in the air sign So while you were doing this particular project, I mean, you saw the things that were in the sub-prisoned, perhaps desirable outcome? Well, it did it first in the first few months, especially when we were very self-conscious in the new day of the same, keeping track of self-competence, you're saying, I love you, you're , it's  that. But after a while, you're just going to forget about it. And I have it just everywhere, and I'm in terms of this happening. I think that happened. , they had a little note about stuck in my, , Jack and Pock, and that I'd put that one there at irritating the photo or something now. You said I love you. And the script one is that they didn't work. It made me look really, really insecure. I mean, I got to sing whole in album somebody. And I knew that they were somebody. How many times the pause? I said I'd love you. I mean, I would feel constrained to keep my average up. Ah, ha ha ha ha. You think people are at conscious sleep count anymore? Oh, yeah, I think so. I mean, I think there's always that sort of, especially in a relationship. Especially in the longer it is on, you have that sort of little begrudging everything from, and I'm always the one who's the car. wanting to eat our changing toilet and grow to another spontaneously. You don't bring me flowers anymore. , it's, I think the soy sauce and the talent on the right and then helps to let it out. Even if it's completely irrational, we can't even get it. Who's our thing? We receive, Sena, of the heart. Let's talk to me anymore. When I come to the door You can wait in the room Stay tuned Every Scott is ready to stop, it's called one of these things It's not  you are ready Well it's good for you It's a very strange place. So, I think I know this. It is quite a number bringing you stories of people using them as a message, just a shit. No, it's just a shit. Which is an app's number. Is using numbers? You can't. You need to believe. And we were raised to kind of culture is a time to believe in number. The numbers are innocent. They're not involved. They're not engaged. They're not to, they don't cheat us. They're on the politic side. Politicide. They're just pure, beautiful and cool. And so with that premise, Alex Melomid and his artistic collaborator, Tyler Koma, the mission to professional market research. Survey the public about what they want to see, not. And we took the data. We used to paint what greatest number of people asked for. The resulting artwork is at landscape. I want to let tree on the right. They click, loose sky, some deer, family. and that's not instance, good people. Enjoy Washington. Because they wanted some political figures. That was at our discretion. So, who is the better political figure for this country? Mellumating from I did a survey in 14 countries and made paintings stage 1. First of all, the pan out there, people  the landscape, the blue is the favorite color of people. The statistics in front. and it kind of makes its 88% of Americans they have out there since $40.000 for blue and blue. Yeah. Yeah. And so they  wild animals. And they  mountains and water. So the paradise. And scammers are shocked with it. Oh my God, stupid Americans, but they want. But then having this poll made in different countries, all the countries with one exception. one of the same blue landscape what was the country they did not say it was one country which was Holland the Netherlands they preferred Oxford Market to this country what do you make? I do have a philosopher in the East of the Netherlands but they leave an very beautiful country in the museum it's full of realism nice and beautiful There are need beautiful pay and production of lowlands. But when you create more subartheism, even when they create new beens, new beens, new beens, new beens that. There's a lot of art in various forms that are perception of a market perception of what people are going. I wonder if it's one of these things where creating art this way. You can get competent at all, but you're not going to get anything that's really inspiring and really a really gradual part. You're talking about the shes, the slatherfish, we have a cliche of poles, which is not as far. The one, of course, is pulling people in the asking them to constantly, and when we don't believe that art can reproduce this way, really, good art. But on the other hand, we have this image of this crazy artist, where a lot of the area This is... are torturing canvas in whatever way. It's as cliche as you pop in one's. Firstly, so if you're for this concert for the other concert. In 1996, Melomitt and Pomer are expanded to work, teaming up with a musician named Dave Soldier. They surveyed music audience. They've been singing since the December song and said 3 to 10 minutes. They've been topic for a song. For some sense, it's story. of, let's hate it type of person. 33% said holidays, that percentage said religion. So you took the data and produced two songs. One of the other things people said they must hate in the song, that 21 minutes longer song. And one of the other qualities that responded said, they wanted most in the song. That leaves all people in the sense. Popular music, American popular music is almost what people want to hear in the most song. If you ask people what are your favorite instruments and add up the sound. 7-8 favorites, they are those that are used in congressional radio top 40 type of music which are in these dramas. Super size, sir. Let's play with this music. Yeah, I mean, that sounds  any pop song that could be on radio. Well, that's pretty much apparently what people wanted. The favorite vocal styles are low male and low female rock slash low male. Yeah, they  low female voices more than they  high female voices. The high female voice is the second least preferred voice and the least preferred voice is power. Thank you. They can ask you to talk about the abuse papers. What people hate to ask and what do you have to say to the person? No, sorry. quite a diversity in catering. Instruits, there were a lot of catered instruments. They're all personal favorites. Mine, of course, the bank type, the accordion of the Orton banjo, and two by for instance. We had to make sure that all of this were yours. When it comes to most unwanted vocal styles, you kind of opera and rap. You can wear the two most unwanted vocal styles. And so what you did is that you put together in the song you could get there. You have an opera singer, rap. Finding a rap in the things he juste looks at. See if only 10% of people  opera, only 10% of people  rap, say these two categories are not real-life-free. That means if you put both of them in there, only 1% of people would be left to consult, listen to the piece. So we put everything in there, people not . For instance, some people detest cobwebs, so we have the opera singer singing rap about cobwebs. It's a beautiful dance- moderate tempo, that is the speed of the music, of fast-adcent. So we're sure that we can have something that people really dislike, say features of a bagpipe, a opera singer singing about cobwebs. and children's choir sung very very slow. It can be used to be a little bit more. Can you listen to either of these sounds in your own form? Well, actually, I've got to love both of these. I've got to love them, ? I've got a lot of people who said they're dealing with the musicians. Well, what call me and say, just heard the new record, I really, , I fell asleep to your most favorite and I loved it. Yeah, I kind of loved the least favorite too. Why do you think we're all going to the least favorite? Hmm, because it's in my minority, we have this, it's the least favorite of the least favorite. It's not hated me. Just, just, let, , small percentage of people's lives. The obvious thing is, is this, we, we'd  to think of our, self-sustaining the story. It's not why we  that song. We don't  this music. We don't  the children's choir coming in because we think of ourselves as a culture of music. Because it's non-white a pole. It's always right. That is not why we have it. It's literally right. It's literally right. It's literally right. It's literally right. Here's the whole. And then the thing is that in your attempt to just go state by the numbers, it is done is accidental. That's it, and it up with the only gene-spading real work part. But actually, it's , I'll give that. , accidentally maybe, , accidentally not accidentally, but we got it. But then we all are genus to people. That's just  all genus. We're just finding what's in our culture. right channeling the people's wealth. Do you think there are some things that you just stay unquying by? Something we should not have had this number? , we have to have a great share. A ten year spent. If numbers let it be numbers, but we need to know. We need to have a context in this app. but common belief in my called common faith. And right now the common faith or the number and let it be this is better than enough. It's much better than enough. Oh, the real handers fall in their search and search. That's right, in days or numbers. By describing some things in numbers, in data, usually means that there are other things. that we are choosing not to qualify, not to go to that mall. Badm David Sin is an economics correspondent for NPR, the public puts in the economic coverage we do feel our show and does the planet money podcast. But years ago, he did a story for us about his uncle Jerry. His uncle Jerry spends a lot of time gathering data and putting the lists. The lists of sports scores going back decades. The list of all the people he has ever told me. The list of all the sales and pharmacy who works at since he began working there. The list of all the lists. And then, one less. The list of the values more than any other less. The list happened in this day with life. This end. My uncle Jerry's list was something I've heard about my whole life. And I finally decided to find out what you're wrong with him. I'll need to get to know him better. Jerry's always been quiet. He lives alone right near where he grew up. And dad, baby brother. He was the message, she was six. He's 52. He gets a monthly SSI check. And he has a two-day or week job. And a bit serious, fine-sing. You're talking, Jerry. written down everything he's done every day since 1955 news 10 years old. I got a jack to be sonny's it. Remember I told you years you don't have them listen to me worth nothing. I told him the thing I said look I don't know what this is going to come to but says something's going to come out of this I have this funny family and what do you think that is? No no I just it didn't it looked something good I know it's going to be it's going to make it very very very very happy. Go in. Jerry always carried the scrap of paper to shirt pocket on his wallet. He writes down everywhere he goes and everyone talks to him phone over the course of the day. At the end of the day he takes everything he's written on the scrap paper and copies it onto one of those desk counters down. There's what each day, it's owned for which in the whole year it's on what it's passing soon. Toon and help me with the rain. He checks and rechecks every onion. Only when he knows everything is perfect, but it's perfect for a check and okay, it's a bottom to best count it to me. Once he's done that,  before it goes to sleep, that makes me feel sick. So this is just, that's sitting on the table. That's sitting on my television desk when I did all this. He's a good boy, it's a long day. Sal, they December 13, 1997. Sunny and cold. Anytime's checks, what The race, Marie called Jerry and Cheryl twice at check was, Cambridge I got to check. The check marks indicate how many times he's done so. Every event gets at least one share. So if he goes to the store five times, that's five shares. Every event gets its own mind. And each day's list is about eight and nine months long. One of the strange things about the list, that he always refers to himself and the person who writes Jerry or he's not. the initials J.B. The words I or me never appear anywhere in these passions. And he's got this elaborate code. See, I put a star on the top of the thing that means I hit a great day. And it plus I write in different color pens. Something that I write in black and sometimes I write in blue. blue means I'm very happy. Red means a semi-good day. Blood black means a bad day. Blood very good day, but... just a bit. In the pages we look, some days would have two or three blue lines and the rest would be black. Other days everything morning was gone, or the afternoon was better, it had the red and blue. The thing is, even after you explained all of these photos and colors, I couldn't understand the diaries at all. No one could accept the jerry. He uses his own abbreviations. This is hfpl02. I'm into honey farms. on the closing when there was a lot. P.A.S. that's still an actual insistent house I would all of. Yes. S means... S actually for S actually. S.A.S. Hello, then... You what? Terry's girlfriend's shell called... You're just a good garlic? But you... ... and you see it off... ...in a very moment... ...you care? I'm just kidding with you! You're gonna be hanging together together, right? Or maybe with you? Still good. She's, you do that, you do that one to me. Alright. Yes, dude. Ah. Yeah. What are you doing now? No, the check. Let's do check. Sure. Yeah. See that to me is so funny that you just had this really emotional conversation with her and all you did was put another check next to her name. Is I keep it all then, he? Or she says to me. Jerry said he doesn't  to write about his form, so that's why he just put a check. He doesn't want to write how he felt about talking to Sheryl and anyone else. He said it's nobody's business. Of course that's. most interesting part. That's exactly what I wanted to know. Why was one phone call from Cheryl written in black or another was in blue? What happened that one day at McDonald's that made him put it down in red? My family doesn't understand this. She's an apple. Thanksgiving. Jerry has a big box of undefeated gifts. My dad said Jerry why not just keep a few of them while the rest of the world. Jerry got angry. He said he'd say... those pens is whole life and you need it on place the rest. It is  a hobby that everybody says it's soup, but I don't think it's good. How did you start doing this? Do you remember when you started? I don't know why I just, , since my fat or my family maybe got to be with you, because he used to write down things too, he had a point in his head. And he doesn't  you, bro. He thinks it's a waste of time. He thinks it's, it's why you write down it. This is more or just  to because you write down a point when you have business with you don't you? So yeah, I'm a business man. Did was shown in Jerry, I know I could take out a scrap and put another shot next time. I look bad with one shot but I was  3 to 2 years ago were desirable to spend magic. Really? talking Jerry said to me, I hate to connect. But in fact he's surrounded himself with the past. When he was walking as a partner, it's a funny number to stop the pile of newspapers all over the place that it used to keep tracking the sports school. It doesn't stop him to take the incredible or the children's village from the 70s. Still over the years ago, members from jobs and some nonsense left. He keeps the answering machine perception that every method is ever gotten. His history is around him all the time. I don't think anybody else is in five minutes. The voice is losing my kids. Two marriages. I thought that was  the might world when I heard it. I was , today's time. I think that is worse than death. It's a culture. It is this time. It's a f***. You never went through it for this time. It's a f***. It's just a weird thing you need, but a cool. Or the voice. The voice says everything which. says, and she leaves the room, and you say everything. But you weren't saying the church called from his back. He was great. Look. Yeah, but I had no idea. Call back. We were getting divorced. I thought I really brought the meat. They I get divorced to the horse side. This. And nobody did. I just came home. Slap. Ok. And the phone you were saying that you told your father you wanted to tell your father you could you said I could have been somebody because of this list what did you mean by that? I could be  I've I've my life stories most of my life story when I did just the diary and Frank might be the diary of Jerry Why do you think people  reading the diary of Infrag? It's interesting because she wrote different things that she did in life. , you just  my stories, but I think might be the best of all, because I had no interest in students that my life. From what to the zoo to California, everything, everything, everything, everything. So I will never wear. I  it. Keep a lot. the way you can normally let me survive with the values to say that's our image of life. I knew I avoided by myself. 19 years already didn't have a wife in the 19 years I survived out there anyway. I don't enjoy what put it this way. But when I look at his last I think he does them because they give him something to do every day. And then seeing every day written down  that. Page of the tape. perfect word. His life seems less empty, less lonely. The less proof he spent time at people he care about. And he's been twice. He's done. Oh, the macro! Psychoprisic! Can you believe that it's knowing my character? See, and publish? See, I have to write that down in the book. See, it's no. Coming up on Numbers to Love with a Pettable Success. It's a minute. A public radio international. To American life in my class, each we can approach them with course we choose some theme, and try to provide the variety of writers from there to get what that is. Using the mission. We've arrived at X4 of our program, the salesman, will power sports for marketing for brand solutions. And his boss wanted everybody in the front understand that are principles, bringing in for us and that's you. And so the boss had real and the other staff was with his exercise with him. He had to mark it themselves. Do someone need to use all the tools of modern brand life? Will it chose this one? , really one out of my life. She's probably the closest person to me and I think as you'll see later on as I discuss it was great actually. We'll get more about that. Customer. It's so strange to hear you say that word. I know. It's funny. It's really interesting. Obviously I don't think my wife has a customer. , I date my wife's who were 15 when the same college. You got married right after college and we've been married for five years. When I went home to do the exercises, I was , oh, there's definitely a student in the toilet. No, I know, I know. I was , what is that stuff about? I had my wife come up with her and she used what's important for her. This was her wife. This was her wife. Exactly. She came up with an honest, money to give you a patient understanding strong, protected, empathetic, loving, and gentle. And really to take it in that next step further, I said, what these are really great attributes but how many I want to act upon is how can I be organization, fighting, service, please you. And it's really saying, we're trying to find ways better to find the service to you. Now if you were actually working with a real firm that was some product, this would be more or less the equivalent of one. I think customers, big damage to them on what is they really want. Exactly. That's exactly right. Me being the product. How can I, how can I show you that are loving and gentle and understanding, that it, etc. What would be the way that I can call and do on it? So she actually gave me examples. , when you hold my hand, you make me laugh, take time out if they make sure I'm happy. Okay. Hang up your clothes after. business trip, try to stay healthy, work hard, work for our future, work at our relationship. Examples  that. So what I had to said, and this is what we usually do in organizations, we do a brain ladder. An example of a, , we work with some major restaurants. They might list something , it's easy. That's very functionalized, we're well-ocated when the restaurant is getting third. Concentrating on that. and it makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad we're so happy. Well, make me feel that I can get problems. You get problems with making you feel better. I can talk straight on other aspects of my life. So we go something very small, functional, clean to concentrate your children. Full film. What I said is if the work-swar organization, why couldn't it work for me so I might find. So... Why you listed her examples? I pulled one out and I said okay, well,  picking up my clothes Let's say I come home bag on And I'm supposed to hang up my clothes I'm gonna do this No, not usually Exhausted but I said let's just start with that Let's say if I take one clothes, what does that do? What is that can give you? She goes well well,  really what that does? That the vaccine that your partypin That's great. Knowing that we're a team, how does that make you feel? What is that giving? As well, when I know I'm a team, , really working together. That leads to strong relationships. Makes it feel it's positive. Exactly. Exactly. And that she, , can rely. That's the best way to pass to go. What you get to have a strong relationship as an example. She does what that is called for research. That's really great. So I went from something that's very simple as picking up clothes on my garment baggling. This is great, very functional. To total total up and in the string. But in another example was called, , and I'm usually pretty good about that. We're in travel or even work in the corner. But do this call or , do you just do it today? Yeah, just to see how she's doing, it's done. Maybe some days out of the yard. This is going to be telling me. because obviously she's a customer and she feels mind-plotting. That's important to her and as a customer I know I'm gonna satisfy her. Same with coming home and hanging up the garment bag and clothes with me. Yeah, this track is just one of the things that I think is just, is it makes you really think that how often do any of us go to people in her eyes and ask, are you getting familiar with you? Can I be Yeah , and really in a nutshell, that's exactly what this is. Are you satisfied? Yeah. Before you actually went through this process, Hitchie always said, she would say, every night, then , I want you to pick up, you shouldn't leave this stuff, you can't even see the radio, she'd said this before. , yeah, obviously, I mean, these aren't really big. , heard, chattering. No, I know, but it's me that's what the interesting thing is that, is it? Why was it so different? doing it in this context, why is it in this context? Got the message, where it's before you did. Well, I think it's in the past, it's, , I'm called. It's always been to something kind of under the breath that don't appreciate what it called, and you're something that happened. , I'm not even answering the questions. But I think the reason why this was so powerful is we actually sat down It was just as Tony focused on. and she wrote it down, this is what's important. And it's almost very elementary, spelled it out. It's almost ,  what it's almost ? It's  the woman talked about certain emotions and there's the way that men talk about certain emotions. And what you and your wife said it invented was a guy's way to talk about stuff that women normally talk about. Yeah! That's a good question. Or it's , she spoke you in gun. I guess because of my understanding of the organizational identity model and because I could put it in business term, I don't know maybe you're right, maybe that's how I can act with it in a light bulb kind of went on. It's funny because  there are certain things about our own lives that we are hesitant to quantify. No I mean, and what you've done essentially in this example. Is it you've really tried to quantify it  what could be more delicate? the then person then and this is the marriage Well  I said I wanted to do this with my one I placed my wife by me else and so she is the everyone best friend My or I have me sir Oh, we're strong, has my true. Oh, we, as a witcher. Oh, we, as a witcher. Oh, we, as a witcher. I'm back. I'm back. Break it down. Well, we end our program today with this attempt. Quantify what roughness. Short story by Woody Davis. Read by Matt Mawai. Quick warning to listeners before we begin this story. Nation's the existence of sex. Very explicit but. He's sitting there staring at a piece of paper and Chronicles trying to break it down. He says, I'm breaking it all down. And take it with six hundred dollars. And after that, there's more for the whole tap. and food so on for just 10 years. Say $80 a day. No more  $100 a day. And we made love say once a day, average food or the downs are sharp. And each time, last evening, to be a few hours, 30, 15 hours, which is expensive. So of course, that wasn't all the one on the list, we together on the other one, it's not the long list. Thank you. looking and looking and looking and looking and looking and looking. She smiled. Didn't stop talking and sing. Something I said she would sail into it as an edge for me. She would be gone from the little wings of the smile too. And tell me jokes. I love it. But didn't exactly know what to do about it. Just smile and back. Slow. Just not. So she talked and touched the moon show. how she kept touching. Stay close. If you're with each other all day long, you can keep tapping, touch his smiles, and it adds up, it builds up, and  it, be, you're talking, you're gonna be now in that. No, you don't think, you just feel this kind of destination. What's coming up after you leave where you are, you're not always tapping. Not your hand. Somewhere inside your body, you're all through your body, so all mouth and mouth and come together as you're getting that you can't help, and it's a real performance we all pours out. Slow. You don't need to take a can and hurry up. Hold back, hold back and touch the edges. Everything is ready to be wrapped. I have to find it. Let's move on. When you're sitting here too weak to stand. After a while you have to go fast and rest. You need to come back and hold on to work. It's a little light coming to you. You see you weigh in now. You need to see. Pray. not a lot of shots from the bottom then start the top and the bottom then you don't listen that thing. Let's go to the bottom and move on. So, face to its skin. I sell other goods in this skin just into something else. And you can start going. Not how much you call on the old region will be not. You will not be your dies down a little bit then you start to get your lunch. I'll go over that start job again. face. Now, luck is almost still a surprise. Never stop, even after it's over. It never stops being a surprise. It's more  you have a good 16 or 18 hours a day. It's not even when you're not withers. Still going on. It's good to be a wife or more because it's going to be so good to get back. It's still there, can you? And you can't go off and look at some old street or some old painting without feeling it. Bye, she thinks. happen the day before the don't mean much by themselves or wouldn't mean much if you weren't having this thing to get but you can't forget it's all inside you all the time so it's more  say 16 to 100 would be 6 dollars an hour which isn't too much and then it really keeps going on while you're asleep either your property that's something else I'll build I get everything I know most about this build because I spend a lot of every morning so I was going building, and I closed my eyes, and I've seen these cool spaces, and I've just piece in the sun. I've seen the bricks of the floor, and the snow and all the things in the same scene, and the things between the kind of dark frame around what it has seen from the gardens. And this space was an extent to the things that are cool in the sun, and gray shadow. That kind of blue and shade, glowing, light and sun, glowing, and dark and there's also this great height of this scene. I go back with a note for those who are lying. I'm asleep and I'm not dreaming about it, but she's lying next to me. Wake up and I'm lying to the night and remember she's there. You notice, say, when she's lying on the bed, now she's curled around me. You look at her closed eyes when she's lying to me and you get that soft ear. You're just going to be a little bit of a stir-fry. I want to see her frown, I'm still on your sleep. She's forgot. I'm lying in the bed. something's pop. So I just look at her and look at her and look at her. She's an X. There's no way from the way she'll be able to see her. She's an X. There's no way from the way she'll be able to see her. And fall asleep. She's sleeping. She's sleeping. She's still trying to hold on. But it is an over one and a a. Those on afters all over. She's still inside you. You filled with her. You can powder and blend into her. For a small, warm body moves. It's all inside you. This for a while after. Then you begin to lose. I'm losing. Here, afraid of how weak you are. You can't get her all back into you. And now the whole thing's in the out of your body. It's on your mind. Pictures come to you one by one. Look at them. Some of them laugh on. We're together in this very light-clim-place coffee house in breakfast. The place is so light and innocent. Some clear blue eyes and some smile-mouth. Colorful clothes even printed musically trees, which is how they look at them. The light brown and red gold are beautiful. And the brown-clim-place brown walls. Colorful is the white hair on this light. Maybe Third R. Children and their children could get their bodies test. Children, their kids can have fun, do something! How about this? ready for little things. We were in bed and she asked me to let some sat here and I was surprised because she didn't seem to worry about herself at all and I was getting into it and she did worry about herself. So I answered what I was thinking and said stupidly that she had a very beautiful body of her body. And I really meant it as a mask which said kind of sharply it's not my house. Sorry, and once she lay over against me, eight and night, she started talking and breath in my hair and she just went on and on and on and on and on and on and fast and fast and she couldn't stop and I loved it. Just felt that all that life and I was running into me too, I had so little life. Her life for fire was coming into me and that hot breath in my ears just wanted me to go on talking forever right there, and I would go on living  that and be able to college glue acting ever. I don't know. Then you forget some of them. They'd be mostly almost old in the end. You work hard at remembering everything's now, so you want to know. But you can kill it, too, even by thinking about it too much, so you can't help think about it in a moment or time. And then when the pictures start to go, start asking us questions. Just a little questions that sit in the eye without any answers. Why did you leave a light on? Do you want to? Which had it on the night after that, which had it off the last night. And another question, little questions that nagged. And finally, the pictures go, and these dry little questions just sit there without any answers. And left with this large heavy pain,  numb and breathing. Try to ease it by getting out in public places with people. No matter how good you are pushing me, just when you think you are right for a little while, you say, and hold me off without your strength. something very little and I'm spotting around. Suddenly we'll all come back. We're here in Norse, maybe to cat climb, they're something else  a recryte. You're here at Make that connection, how hard are you? Have no control over that pain comes back. So hard to do a freight, afraid of how you're going to fall back into it. You wonder, no, you're terrified of how you're ever going to climb out of it. So it's not a v-hour of the day while it's happened. It's really for hours and hours every day after, for weeks. Release. So less and less. So that you can work out a ratio with the 1. Maybe after 6 weeks, I'll be about an hour or so. Then I'll get a few more tears in there, a few minutes here and there. And I'll have an hour for this. Sometimes it all comes back and stay awake. So when you add up all that, even the spendings, 3000 hours. You have to figure in. at times 2, I don't know. There weren't. She was one. I told her, I loved her. I couldn't help it. This is the first time I was happy. Now I was half-awn, probably there made you complete. She let me. She couldn't, I couldn't completely dissolve me. So sure, not that things too. So I hoped. And I didn't know of any way to tell her first. She did. I had to see her. This was bird. In fact, I'd loved her, but she did not feel the same without me. She'd say the same bad. It was just that I hadn't held her. That's all. Because it was bursting inside. And saying it would even begin to take care of what I was fearfully. I couldn't say anything, but I was feeling it because there was so much. Words couldn't handle it. Making love only made it worse because then I wanted words badly, but they were no good. No good at all. But I told her, anyway, I was flying. Her hands were up by her head and lightning was on her stomach and her lock was a little light on the face. She was afraid to say it. But I had to say it because I wanted her to know. It was the last night I had to tell her then I'd never have another chance and just said, Before you go to sleep, I have to tell you before you go to sleep time up in a meeting. Right away, she said, I love you too. And it sounded nice and she didn't need a little flat. But then it usually sounds flat. When somebody says I love you too, because they're just saying back, you didn't think they do. And the problem is that I'll never know if she knew. Or maybe some days will tell me when she knew. There's no way to know now. And I'm sorry I did that. I was a trap. I didn't even put her in. I could see it's a trap because if she hadn't said anything at all, that would have hurt me too. As though she would take each other from just accept. not giving anything back. So she really had to, I mean even if just to be kind, she had to say it and I don't really know now. Another bad time, or it wasn't exactly bad. It was easy. So when I had to leave, time was coming, I was beginning to tremble and feel empty. Nothing, nothing, nothing, time, something hoped me of domain right! E utveckle. came. He was ready, had to go. So it was just a kiss, a quick one. So we were afraid of what I had after him. He was almost wild and he reached up to a hook by door, which sure. Green, blue shirt, and put it in my arms, and put that soft cloth, and it's full of smell. From the nose near the foot. We sleep and our feet will get wound and you'll feel that I need to sleep and be blessed. I was holding tight that last minute or two because this was it. We come to the end of things always change, so this is really it. Over. Maybe it works out right, maybe you haven't lost anything that I don't know. Not really, sometimes you think, be  a prince. You're just  a kid. And other times you were afraid, you're afraid not all the time. on them what's gonna do to how  what to do. Walking away I look back once, blow up still. It's your stand on that, . You can only really see white face still looking at. No one knows. I guess you get to a point where you look at that pain this word. there in front in three-seat away line and box, open box, open box, it's hard and cold in the bottom of the metal. Just look at it there and say, alright, okay, no guy. That's what it is because  all about before you go into the note, paint is a part of the whole thing. And it isn't that we can say afterwards the pleasure was graded. It's a paint, that's what you can't, that's nothing to do. You can't after and it lasts longer. So the question really is, why doesn't the pain make you say, I won't do it. When the pain is so bad that you have to say that, but you go. So I'm just thinking about how you can go in the $600 more or $1000 and how you can come out with an old shirt. Wake it down, that's what he gave us.
