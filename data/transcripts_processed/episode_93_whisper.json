Let me talk about about it. But since the 13th century, it's what we talk about. This very moment. It could have fooled me. It could have fooled my French news for the bulk of lightning. You saw me eating someone. It's  a苦 hole. It's likepower. and in Eastern form love, love this happens in the flash. This is Richard Pynne of Cornell University. In the 13th century, he says, Peter, welcome by a fountain in the south of France. Turn to corner, see as Lara. Peter, I go to do her eyes, and then he instantly this life is transformed. And he writes the first lyric of poems, ever written. He says, before this moment, one lives in the state distraction. Things must come and go. Experiences, frightened hearing and calved. And all of a sudden, at the moment, which you encounter the eye of the other turns you into something else. So, in the coming of the whole being, because focused on that experience, all you want to do once you have that experience is to turn through the night. 30 years later. in Florence, Dante goes through the same thing. When he sees top of quite of stairs, the attress. He writes about it. And the idea of this moment, Walter Blightning, get repeated in literature and song theater all through the Renaissance up to the 19th century. And into the present day, today people who have not experienced that Walter Blightning in years, people have been married for decades, go to the movie, watch TV to see it reenact at Overnow. This is what we talked about. Let me talk about that one. In ancient Greek, the Greeks had two verbs for sin, curing, and rocking, curing, and sin, and audio, and observation. Dropping refers to the look of eyes, and flash,  in dragon's breath. It really illuminates the night, but it sends out the fire. And it hits this bit of separate wood, but the moment the fire splashes and the flash and the wood, which is promising and people will come. I was... Scrubs and 것은 cakes, what they use for me, oh this is crazy, well open one, means it can be. It's ice, and something to stop. Let's open light fields, are they excited? Okay, and here's the crazy thing. Everybody knows. that moment of initial lecture, that instant when you're eyes me and you're obsessed with the other person thinking about them all the time. Everybody knows that feeling doesn't usually last, that in some way it's just a dream, that over time, it changes in something different. Here's the thing, even on the day that this romantic myth of love was born, that day in the 13th century when P-Trots are war, even on that day, it was clear that it was just a myth, it was just a dream. P-Trots. It hasn't kept it grow. the usual story that the guide has been given to him. Maybe in America. That's it. I'm always in the decision. The moment that the society is filled with the world, the world, the world, the world. The world. The world. The world. The world. Psychologists have listed the number. You can always take more for each of you. After that, it comes in the nose, comes from the racing spec, the factions of the button, that the dream of it to the house, it comes in the sequence. I wonder if I wonder if you'll be saying this, and explaining this in these terms, if you yourself find Bob right now. Well, the one in fact, I think I need. I think I need. I think I need. And you're gonna get in trouble when this goes. It's not a good thing, right? You're already going to be asked someone's probably not. So you're calling off right now and you're holding to the idea that this is an illusion and it's sort of a looser experience. All I want is more and more illusion. Today, we'll love a glissinter. We come to you with a mission. Since stories of love, in fact, our whole idea of love. These seem to usually have that health deal. During those first moments of falling in love, today, we're Valentine's Day. As a public service, we make an attempt to understand another side of what love means. We're being used to stories of couples that all take place decades after the moment their eyes need. Act one. The point after, the beginning of love. as viewed moment near attending. That too. I met him at the yogurt store, but I do not call him reader of the pack. Cortation during marriage, a cable that could save your relationship no kidding. That's great. Without Dama-Para-Daki-Mensi relationship, who's most intense, most romantic moments came out at the beginning. But at the end. Stay with us. Back one, before and after. Why is it keep growing up on the East Coast in the 1970s? For me, the most romantic songs in the world, and this is kind of a corny thing to admit now, years later, with retrospect. The most romantic songs in the world will brew suspense. Songs about falling in love and rundown each town's majority shore, songs that can be the road together to, , who knows where else. But once Bruce hit a certain age, he's a brightening song to that moment when lightning plushes. in the eyes of me. And you wrote a series of songs, well basically every song takes place, long after a couple fell out of love. And the narrator, the singer in these songs, is remembering that exhilarating moment, and following them up. And then describing them up, and he's in the derudery of his marriage now. And he's laying these two moments side by side, trying to make sense of how one of them has any connection in the world to the other, how one of them led to the other. Well, this next story isn't going to be a part of it. This next story isn't going to be a part of it. It's exactly 20 minutes to midnight on this the eve of my 70th birthday. And I decided to address you for change in writing, odd as that might seem. I'm perfectly aware of how you're going to take the fact that I'm doing this at all, so late at night, and everybody do to arrive tomorrow in the house, still I'm ready. I haven't spent almost five decades with you without learning a few things about you that I can predict and describe the some actors. I admit that she put it. lately we've been more  strangers and husband life. Well so if we are strangers perhaps there are some things I can tell you that you won't have already figured out about that. Tonight we had another one of those long silent evenings after an argument. Remember what we've peppered. We've been bickering all day really but at dinner I put pepper on my potatoes and you said that about how I shouldn't have peppered because it all would have set my stomach. I bother to remark that I used each. I was a child of the church peppers for breakfast, and I wanted to put plain old ordinary black pepper on my potatoes as I had been doing for more than 60 years that was my fruit. Writing this now, it sounds far more tasty than that. And then in any case you chose to over up my town, you simply said, John, you were a fall night for last time you had pepper with your dinner. I said, I was up all night because I dreamed of black pepper. but green peppers. A pepper is a pepper, isn't it? You said. And then I started in life. I got, as you call it, legal with pointing out that green peppers are not black-ed. And from there we moved on to an eating of mutual disregard for each other that ended with your decision to go to bed early. The grandchildren will make you tire, and they're still the half. You had every reason wanting to see them. And yet I felt that you were also making a corner getting yourself out of proximity. leaving me to my expression with another ridiculous argument of suddenly to mean us  a fall. So after you went to bed, I got out the whiskey and started pouring drinks and I had every intention of putting myself into a stupor. It was also my birthday I had drawn, forgive this, away I felt it's time, you had nagged me in an argument and then drawn off that the day had ended as so many of our days and now and I felt well entitled. I had a few drinks. without any appreciable effect, though you might well see this letter as from Netflix to the contrary. And then I decided to do something to shake you up. I would at least make a lot of noise going up, though I'd take a walk around the neighborhood and you'd keep wondering where I could be. Perhaps I'd go checking to a motel for the night. I'd cut even cross my mind that I might leave you all together. I admit that I entertained you thought, I saw it  I could get them out of it. day to day round petty quarrel in the intention that it's mostly being over the past couple years or so. And I wanted out as sincerely as I haven't wanted out of you. And I got up in my seat in front of the television and walked back down the hall of the entrance of our room for it. I suppose I hope to still be awake so I can tell you at this moment this decision I felt had reached. And maybe you were with one of our oldest areas of contention being the noise I may. � and then brain-aggressed sleep that I'm always disturbing my rest. All right. Assuming you were asleep, and don't know that I stood in the doorway of our room. I will say that I stood there for perhaps five minutes looking at even the half-dark. The shape of your body and the blanket. You really did look  one of the girls and we were little nice to stand in the doorway of their room. You were illness last year, maybe it's a small room. And I said, I thought I had decided to leave your peace, well. to my, I know you have gone to the crime. I know you felt sorry, but I think some of you could find some of these stuff here. Of course, I didn't go. I came back to this room and drank more of the whiskey and lost calories. It was  all the other nights. The shows came on and ended in the whiskey began to wear off. It was a little rain shower. I had a moment of the shock and knowing I was 7th. After the rain ended, I did go outside, which was still on the sidewalk and looked at the house. The kids, with their kids, were on the road somewhere between their homes and here. I walked up to the end of the block and back and pleasant breeze blew and shook the drop out of trees. The stomach was bothering me, the stomach and maybe it was the pepper I put on my head, or the digestive well with the whist. Anyway, as I came back to the house, I began to have the earsteel in the that head reef. the last night of my life. There was this small discomfort in my stomach, and no other physical pain I'm used to the small hills inside of me, my ways of eating and drinking. I felt the sense of the end of things more strongly than I can describe. When I stood in the entrance of our room and looked at you again wondering if I would make it true in the morning. I suddenly found myself trying to think what I would say you would indeed be this word the last time I would ever be able speak and I began to know I would be At least words in the letter aren't blurred by tone of voice, but the old aggravating sound. When we talk about it, I began with this and the idea that after months of thinking about it, I would at last try to say something to you that wasn't colored by our disinfection. What I have to tell you must be explained in a rather roundabout way. I've been thinking about my cousin Louise in her husband. When he died, and she stayed with us last night, something brought back to me what is really owned the memory of the moment. It reached me that moment, cross more than 50 years. As , Louise is nine years old and I am more of  an older sister than the cousin. I must have told you at one time or another that I spent some years with her back in 1933 when she was first married. The memory I'm talking about, comes from that time, and what I have decided I have to tell you, comes from that memory. Father. And that four year we were all used the fact that times were hard and there was no man in the house. So I suppose I felt that wrong in some kitchen. In any case, from another we came ill there was the problem of us, for children. So I was the oldest. I wasn't old enough to stay in the house alone or to nurse for either. My grandfather came up with a solution and everybody went along with it. But I would go to the movies this four time and the two girls go to the state of the So we closed up the house and I got on a train to Virginia. I was a few weeks shy of 14 years old. I remember that I was not able to believe that anything truly bad would come from a spursy. It was constantly gladly opportunity at a quarter of the travel hundred miles south of Charlottesville. Where cousin Louise had moved with her new husband only month earlier in the wedding. Because we traveled so much the beginning. And you never got to really know Charlottesville. In 1933 he was a very tall man. and the presence of the private air and grace for me of moving. That always made me think of athletic and contest. The AdWords is an 80-yard in Washington, and laid off in first-months and pro-Sports New Year. Louise was teaching in the day school in Charlottesville, so it can make you the new in Charlottesville spending most of this time with me to work in fixing the house. I only met Charlottes once in twice before the wedding, and I already admire one thing, the prospects in time. in his house or have gone fishing within the small streams of Central Virginia, was all I thought about over the way that. And I remember that we did go fishing one week and then I went up spending a lot of time in Charlottesville, I think the house, one water line, under a window of plumbing. All I had time with Louise to listen to her read from the book she wanted me to be interested in, walking with her around Charlottesville in the evening, looking at the city as a close man. For sitting on her small porch and talking about family, mothers. stubborn ones, the children who we saw every day at school. But what I want to tell you has to do with the very first day I was there. I know you think I used far too much energy thinking about and finding way for the past. And I therefore know that I'm taking a risk by talking about this ancient history and by trying to make you see. But this all has to do with you and me, by me. And now I'm right in the bill of the defined ourselves and the same mood of that bitterness. That summer, 1933, was unusually warm between the heat, along with my impatience to arrive, and in the train almost on the barrel. I think it was just passed down when the cold and the station in Charlottesville, with me hanging out on the window of looking through the Charles. It was Charles who had come to meet me. He stood on a crisp looking serious surface seat, with the Starbode of Cock and just the end of the expected young movie, where trouble. illegally that moment is asked. I waited and raped back and I might have jumped out the window, trying to slow you more little more and had four stops and shakes left. I made my way up, carrying the cloth bag, my grandfathers, getting the trip. Mother had said to her room that I looked  a car factory. When I stepped down the shake hands with Charles, I noticed that what I thought was the new suitcase pattern. Well, long shot. A smile in. I was perceptive in that scene, it is cheerfulness, it is not entirely air. He was a man out of work, and so inspired himself in his worries, sliders, shatter, and another life-grab, loud counsels. We walked through the station to the street, and on up the steep hill of the house, which was a small, clap-ed structure, cottageery, the porch, at the end of the short, side-blocked, blind-blow. Here's the weeks coming out. house her arms already stretched wide and braised. Lord she said, I swear you've grown since the waiting time. Charles took my bag when he saw it. Let me look at you young name, Louise. I stood for inspection. And I showed up me over I saw that her hair was pulled back so that a few strands of it had come loose that it was really in re-albernation's sun. I suppose I was a little in love with her. She was grown and married now. She was a part of what seemed. great mystery to me even as I was about to enter. And of course she remembered how that feels marine wanted us on the verge of things nearly a bell, nearly old and a fallen luck. I looked at Louise's happy flushed face and felt a deep ache as she ushered me into her house. I wanted to soak cold. Inside Charles had poured lemonade for us and was sitting in the east chair by the fire and started to sit in his. Louise wanted to show me the house and back yard achieved. killed and turned into a small vegetable garden. She must have sensed how thirsty I was. And so she asked me to sit down and have a cool drink before she showed me up. Stayer. Now, of course, if you come back on, I remember that those rooms she was so anxious to show me were meager indeed. They were not much bigger than the classes really in the paint, faded, at all. The furniture she deranged so artfully as coming apart. The picture she put on the walls with prints, had a magazine cover's mustered. And the curtains over the windows were the same ones at hung in her childhood bed in for 20 years. I can nicely see she said in the depth of pain smile. Of course, the quality of her pride had nothing to do with the finest or lack of it in these things, but in fact, that they belonged to her, and she was marriedly in her own house. On this day in July, in 1933, she and Charles were waiting for the delivery of a fan, scrounged enough money by from Sears to the catalog. There were things they would rather have been doing, especially in the seat, and especially with me there. The Monticello wasn't far away, but University was within Wattinges. And without too much expense, one could write a taxi to one of the lakes. They had hoped that the fan would arrive before I did, but since it hadn't, since neither Louise nor Charles was willing to leave the other alone while traits enough it would need that day. It wasn't anything to do with quite around. Louise had opened the window. of Shabbishay, and we sat in her small living room and drank an lemonade, fanning ourselves and folded parts of Charles Morn and newspapers. In time to time and anemic breath of the air would move the shades slightly that everything grew still in it. We were we sat on the arm of Charles's chair and I sat on the soap. We were talking about privacy and thinking about the fact that Thomas Jefferson had invented the dumbwader. How the plumbing at Monochella wasn't least a century ahead of his time. Charles. It was the spirit of invention that would make an end to the rear of the day. That's what I'm aiming for, being an independent job and that I worked with. On the lemonade ran out, the weeds got up and went into the kitchen to make some more. Charles and I talked about taking the weekend of fishing. He leaned back into the chair and threw his hands behind his head with him satisfied. In the kitchen, Louise was chipping ice for our glasses, and she began seeing something well in her own pleasure. A very remarkable. looking in the shower of a nice set, it occurred to me that I was very happy. I had the sense that soon I would be embarking on my own life, Charles woke, and that in attractive woman  the weasel would be good. Charles Y'all and said, God listen to that, doesn't we have the love it's. And that's all I have from that. I don't even know if the fan arrived later. And I have no clear memory of how we spent the rest of the afternoon evening. I remember the way singing song, or husband meaning back in his chair, holding his hands behind his head, expressing his pleasure and his young wife's. I remember that I felt quite extraordinary and content. that's all. But there are of course the things we both know. they moved to Colorado to be near Charles Pence. We know they never had a meet-up. We know that Charles fell down a shaft at a construction site in the fall of 1957 and was hurt so badly that he walked and I know that when she came to stay with us last summer she told me she'd learn to hate and not for what she'd had to help him do all of those years. No. It started earlier and was deep at the end of it. She hadn't mind at the care of him, the washing and feeding of a number of small tasks. She had to form each and every day all day. She hadn't mind. In fact, she thought there was something in her makeup that liked the meat. The trouble was simply that whatever she had once loved, and she had stopped. But, for many, many years, we wanted to die. She felt only supplication in me was near enough in such a way. only irritation and anxiety. She said all this and then look at me her cousin who had been fortunate enough to have children and to be in love over time and said John how had you and me. And what I wanted to tell you has to do with this fact that while you and I had had had one of our whispering arguments only moments before. I felt quite certain of the simple truth of them that which is that whatever arc. complications we have managed to be in love over time. We said, I think it started out with such high hope she said, it said, I wasn't there. She looked at me. Don't you? Yes. She seemed to consider this a moon. Then she said, I wonder how it happened. I said, you ought to get some rest or something equally pointless in the monotox. I seem to be the weapon. I had an image of Charles standing on the station platform of Charles, so that some of the Starbodes said it's a copy and there was an image I would see most of the rest of that night, and many another night since. I can almost hear your voice as you point out that once. again, I've managed to dwell too long in the memory of something that has gone, the difference is that I'm not breathing over the past. I'm merely reporting a memory so that you might understand what I'm about to say. The fact is, we aren't the people we were even then just a year ago. I know it. And I know things have been slowly eroding between us for very long. We are a little tired. There are no ones that's no scar, there won't. be obliterated to the letter, even a long-run written middle of the night in desperate sincerity under the influence admittedly of a considerable portion of urban risk, but never the rest of the best tension. That you may know how, over the course of this night, and I came to the end of meeting an explanation of the cut. We have reached this place. Everything is said, seems to have aggravated mindless, not a matter. something one stranger might say to another in one of the thousands certain stances where strangers are thrown together for a time. And the silence begins to go heavy under mines and someone has to say something. Darling, we go so long these days without having anything go through each other. We chill and don't arrive in the morning and once more we'll be in the position of making all the gestures that give them back their parents and they think their parents are. And what I wanted to say. I say to you, what came to me as I thought about Louise and Charles on that day so long as a when they were young, so obviously glad it was other. And I looked at them and knew it and was happy. What came to me was that even the harsh things that happened to me, even the years of anger and silence, even the disappointment and the bitterness and the wanting not to be in the scene even even all that must have been worked. At least I am here. at seven years old. Tonight, I went back to our room again and stood gazing at you asleep, dreaming whatever you were dreaming. And I had a moment of thinking how we were at home's friends too, because what I wanted finally to say was that I remember well our own sweet time, our own hope. And I would  to think that even if it's a very beginning of our lives together, I had somehow been shown that we would end up here with this long real way. the feeling of being trapped together and being tied to each other in a way that makes us wish for out times. Some other planks I would have known enough to accept it all freely from the chain. And if I could, I would do it all dear. All of you, you can saw my sweet, my dear, it was for everything that I was. Richard Basha's story led her to the Lady of the House and spoke the selected stories from Richard Basha's modern library.

That happened in the ninth year of marriage between Linda Howard and Richard Green, who was in Buckle, accorded. After we were married, I would say, was Nicole Warner? Yeah, we had both kids, we had a boy and a girl. And we were... Took the kids out for a pros and the other one. And we were in Huntington and really lived at the time. And I mean, we're sitting down, we're ordering, and this is guy. Very good looking guy, sinnier. And... Was that good? Oh, oh. All of a sudden, oh, yeah. And it dawned on me that this was David. This guy who I dated in high school and then years later had another relationship with, which was part of a hot and heavy relationship several years later when we were already, , at a school for a number of years. And, here he was. He had had no specs and he was, and his hair was all white, and he looked absolutely gorgeous. And I said, did it? And now I all found this thing. Winner? And it would... everything stopped in my mind at that moment and it was kind of  we were trying to be very non-chalance Let's check their hair. Oh, I mean this my husband and he's in our kid That is what I mean while the heart is  blah blah blah blah blah blah And I know it's an old boy, but I can just tell when I go hey The husband kids So he and I have this night little chat while we're standing here and I'm saying to myself in the car, I know that he is thinking exactly the same thing about me. I know it, it's not a doubt in my mouth and I can't believe that we just left now and we're not going to see each other again. I asked him, what is he doing and he tells him that he's a psychoanalyst at the city and this is completely shocked me and I tell him that I'm a close. of course I call it is. Oh, and it has so much coming so much in common and blah blah blah. Well, anyway, the next day I go into my office and there was just, I pressed the button on my answering machine and this is long, messed. I'm thinking, who could have lost his message? Well, I'm gonna play back. So, that is me this note. And it's, it's David and he said, I can't, when I, when I got in the car, I couldn't stop thinking about you and all of this kind of stuff. I was just astounded and I had this big smile on my face and I'm thinking well there's no way I'm going to call him back. So I don't call him back in a few days later he calls and he had been saying to me that it was so wonderful to see me and he'd love to get together and use kind of real missing and so forth. And I didn't call him back and he called back and he looked another miss saying that  if he was sorry that he got in so carried away and I probably have my own life now and I hope. thing and it's probably difficult for me to go and understand it. Just wanted me to know how great it was to me. Oh, you're on life in the husband too. I gave it away. So anyway, at that point when he said that, I waited a few days and it was just I just really wanted to talk to him. So I called him and he said, Why don't we meet before? We had this fabulous fabulous conversation. And why don't we meet per crock? And I got that old deal that I was dealing with being having that rush, no. And somebody's gonna think I'm fabulous all over again. So I started thinking about him thinking about him. And he said, come go for coffee. So I said I would think about it. So I said to Richard Oh, I heard for David and he said, oh yeah, what do you say? Well, , we just had a nice talk and do more than we got caught. And he said, do I mind? Well, I wouldn't  it. But if that's what you'd  to do, go ahead. So I thought about it. And now, in the meantime, he's leaving me messages now. And he's saying, I didn't think of you when I got up this morning. You just wanted you to know that I'm not thinking of you when I'm having a coffee break. And at some of these very seductive messages. And I'm just getting obsessed with him. And I'm thinking, oh my God, I want to see him. Well, I got to a point where I wanted to see him so badly that I was upset. I could not look rich in the night. He came home when I was out there afternoon. I was just terribly upset. I said, rich, I have to talk to you. He said, what's the matter? When I called him the whole story. And he was amazing. He closed arms and then I told him I'm obsessed with him. He put his arms around and he just helped me and he said to me, oh right. I'm so sorry I can't do that way and that was all he said. I couldn't believe I waited for some kind of lecture, why didn't you tell me? I've something, some side jealousy, nothing, just help. I was jealous, but what's it going to do? Fundra, , he once he got two kids and you've been with each other for quite a while. Before and after marriage, he can't get the thunder and lightning back. It's now with different... He was to say, I went downstairs to my office and I called David a medial and I said, this is what just happened. been obsessed with you, told my husband the whole story from beginning to end and this is what he did. He put his arms around me and held me and told him what he said and I said, this is the most amazing man in the world and they said, you married to one hell God. I said, yes, I said, yes, he is. Don't ever call me again. And that was it. When the Howard and Richard Lumis were married for 11 years, his focus definitely Today's guest story is set in the cheers. Okay. Without Tom Cauts says that when he first got to get it with his wife, Jane Kangen, the earliest years were not so very intense. They didn't have that big lightning moment. It was the second D.C.S. by the way of explanation. They saw each other while they also saw other people, and then they slowly decided that they had no interest in the other people. And then they got married. And then three years into the marriage, they moved to a farm in the hamster that they did in Donald's family generations. It was only then Tom Cauts says that they entered their most intimate times together. Yes. close to every year with their marriages and the closest time of all between them came at the end of the marriage when after 22 years together, change came in by the kingdom, in the future. During this time, he started to document what was happening between him and his writing and his newest book of poems called it out is all working again during Kray on us and after the death in 1995 The poems include sad moments and funny moments and a million little details of everyday life during a life-written process One time Jane stairs in the mirror were called here at the end of the face swoon from the grudge and she declares, I am telly-savallas in another download ass. Why would they not contended for months ago? Because Jane did not have a kingdom, at your hands, what he questioned, why he was not contended now? Therefore, he was contended. Here I said about the dog-guess reacting to their illness, about Jane trying to finish her own book of poems called Other Learn. And about small moments when they both realized once again, all over again. What's happened? Along together a moment on 22nd anniversary of her wedding, the classmate she stood at the scene, passing into her back side, loving his cheek against the stubble of her skull. gave her a ring of pink turning, but nine small diamonds were found. She put it on her finger, and immediately named it, please don't die. The kiss and Jane whispered, monk- Jimmy direction, everything's fine. That last bit of course is life and Jane Latton's color, but that's the refrain line of a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, Scott's poem about the dead poets and translates for us, the film Deaths, Shakespeare. Usually when we think about romance, the moment that we think about is the beginning of romance, as the most intense time. And if one of the things that happens in these... is it shows the two of you going to a time that's just as intense. Oh, long-tenth. Marchance. Really, we, man, regret very, very fortunate for the love of the same thing. And then, we began to be sick. I had cancer a couple of times, and then Jane had leukemia. Beginning at the age of 46 and dying at 47. Jane was 90 years younger than me. But when you think about all those. which when  it's probably half, then the sweetness of the intensity and the pain in the intensity is greater than that. I do think that I think in the beautiful. I have often said that obviously the worst thing in my life is change. There's a mind in one of the poems that we used to, we got chained to understand that we would miss. the months of sickness and taking care. I had that sort of literal. I mean, it's alright to tell lies and books, but this was not a lie. I had that sort and wrote down something  that mine that day before we found out. I was optimist and I thought, we've killed. I'll be sorry, we can't take care of it. So it's been some last days. Well last days, it's been poems that I wrote and I'm sorry. during last days of the war. One day, it would be a pop. We hear, we don't know what to check to demonstrate. And it was just fun. And we played it, we came in and came back. And then we stood up and we were shooting in the mirror. This is after also we, she went to her intensive chemotherapy mediation treatment, down that. I've been 15 months old. I'm so sorry. So this was what we did. , the doctors say, what might be a month, but it actually took just a minute. Here are poems for the Gosling. Okay. Home that afternoon, they threw them medicine into the trash. Game for me. The waves are shooting, dry air. So I'm trying to let go. Night, they picked up the telephone to me. Cones and Brock are childing in the heart. The next morning they were choosing among her poems for otherwise. Pick him this for a few and supply each other words as they were advised to go but you have. But they have to. We more work to do on our work. He saw how weak she found. I said, maybe not now, maybe clean it. Can you check her hand? Now she said, we have to finish it now. I said, I said, I said, I'm sleeping. exhausted in the sleep she said was infant working in infant. He asked her, what call was she thinking when we buried? I hadn't thought she said. I wondered about the white sour communities he said. Her favorite Indian silk paper and ponder cherry a year and a half before. She wore fur masks. for the earth's death. She smiled. Yes, excellent, she said. He didn't tell her that a year earlier, they were being awake. He had seen her in the coffin, in her white, someone came in. They talked about their adventures, hiding through England and First Mary, and excursions to China and India. Also they remembered what in India. palms on it, working from bones to them, working in the dawn, reading Shakao Fawha. When he plays thousands of afternoon asignations, character into bliss and repose him is painted dead. Tain burst into tears and cried, no more f***ing, no more f***ing. Encountering him three nights before she died. Tain needed lifting onto the command. We write to them help you back into bed. We find the dog and the turn to find her across the room, saying, the straight tree. We take good and stand, how can she walk? If you're looking for, and called for an ambulance to the hospital. But when you told him, the mouth twisted down, and tears started. Do we have to? We can't see. Jameson. Patience. We would be more than dying. That is superficial. What's worst is a separation. Once you no longer spoke, they were a long-degandemic touchy. They say, fixed down in her beautiful anomalous, ungrowing ground, shining, ungrinking. And passionate with all three. One. And by one they came, the oldest and dearest, to say goodbye to the strange heart. The first she said, the name is WebPen Touch. And she smiled, then turned one mouse corner. On the last day she stared, silent with her hands, and her eyes started to move. The meaning is place beside her where her eyes stand. It told her, what would these letters in the box? See, that's spoken in three hours. And now James said, balanced words. Okay. Can they say that night, her eyes open as they stay until she died. Brainstem breathing started. He bent to kiss her pale cool lips again. And felt him one last time, and then burst and pecked to kiss her. In the last hours, she kept her forearms raised with pain fingers clings to the cheek level, the goddess figurine of emergency. Sometimes her right fist flickers spasm in tortoise. For 12 hours, until she gunk, it kept scratching, being pain-baked, long enough. The sharp, almost sweet smell, began to rise from her pain. That's a line from her bungalow. She wrote a wonderful poem called Get His Bird and she just But that's not a thing!! Nobody has noticed...rewaking because of all of this shit. She would imagine. Do you feel  going to the process of devising and finishing this book and publishing it has kept you suspended in that period of morning for the longer than perhaps you would have added on it? No, I don't think so. I think that it has been very helpful to my mom. I don't think I would. straight away. But I have some good do of it. I really understand that I think that one of the most common things when some of those mornings and the rest is you're not exactly which what to do with you. Yeah now. It's  they're unreachable and then you have all the feeling and it's you're very worried. I had a reason to wake up in the first year. When it was very acute, I know , the spring blood scare the dog, but I didn't get up. When he asked about the set of palms, which happens after she dies and you said about running set of values to him. Did he actually write her values every day after she didn't? I know, I began, I found out that Maggie Fisher was trying to find out. And the first thought you have is, everybody. Something happens and you think, oh, I can't wait to tell them, I can't do this. And I did what I think probably a lot of people have done. I began to write their letters and the letter forms to me. In fact, in the letter I could wander around  a friend of this. I could look out the window and tell her about the weather. I could talk her about things she was particularly interested. This was the first one, letter with no one there. Your daffodils rose up in the caverns from the yellow and body on the hillside garden of bricks, you lay down and say, squatting, paying space and face mask or can be keepers against the black planet. But a couple of plants that they all will hit this day while your so-called gardeners and your center full end and talk to you crying. You can back to the sense, to talk to you for a second. This news to tell Maggie Fisher's pregnant, I cared myself for a man that I'm a girl's first incognitive weekend. As three of her was bounced up, Roy is on an actress. Joyce and Ryan are from much of the moon, and as struggled weekly to see her as a be-don't-you. Today it's four weeks. Since you lay on a painted bed and I close your eyes. Yesterday I cut irises to sit in the picture on your grave. Today I brought a caraf to full of frustration. I remember bone pain, vomiting, and I remember pond after wounds. My routine is a stance, coughing, the glow of the breakfast. Writing in this one. When I go to bed to sleep after baseball, Gus follows me into the bed room as he used to follow us. Most of the time he flumps down in the park, the sand on his post. Once a week I drive to Tutton to see Dickton and Anne. Anne doesn't understand much, which he knows you did. I feel very free. The tune of Dick and Neat talk and things are concerned. now. He saw me somewhere as dead. How are you doing? When you were dying, he said he didn't fear punishment. He was the day I'd speak about. I found a human and walk outside. Missed my stick and he fainted. My eight ears clear. Who all of a sudden was being held right to meet me. Here's a surprise and she was interesting. It's a fortune. invisible. The waters of equal palm, greater and flashing boxes just leaving out. Always weather, running its book in the world, returns you to me. Ordinary days will pass when you work over poems and the separate rooms. I remember watching the days of the tenure and the window into the garden snow nights. Your face ran. You can imagine, you are good to imagine. Your presence in the house is almost as enormous as being from your essence. Driving home from tilt and I remember how you cherish that this center of the middoor of the farmers, I am staying in faith. Right past been, if you have consciousness now, if something I can call you as something Without any Björd. I doubt you remember the last day. I lift your waist and body onto the cover of your arms, look to the mirror and neck. Ewing your boner boner so that it will move on the way. Feet knee, feet, mums, mums. You lay astonishing one more while I was sling green and saying, that's what surprisingly amazing grace is called. three times today I drove to your brain sometimes I'm not going to or so give a garden I imagine you return the phone bags and groceries somewhere in the back and so it's trumped with delicate rays as if proposing in the counter door fashion with no that's what I did I mean, that's, , I'm really addressing her sort of. What one I make a joke with? What one do you want to do? Do you want to define your still writing her letters, writing her poems as letters even now? I'm learning actually what happened after this. continued right along the game but it's no longer a no longer addressing you and talking about Jane and her music. She has receded. This is horrible and inevitable in that story. I can't just talk to her in a second person. Cameron policy that is where Jane can use control agar. Then me some love and Sitting up there And I love When you are away Send me your picture And I love you Sitting up there I can hold it. Me, ten you are here. Can you see me all get a sin?
