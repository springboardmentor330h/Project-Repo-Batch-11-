You can only really have it a job that is not required total concentration. So you're sweating now, you're fine, but you're just here. You're doing whatever. And so they're talking about the gutter key. And you can remember, this is the pivotal conversation. And it seems  you're talking about the gutter key. And they get to talking about where it should be. And in their mind, it is not belong in the middle of the internet with the boy, poor boy. The M's, M's, M's, P's, letters that will just join any word for the asking. And, is in letters, you don't even hear it. Damn, what's it doing? Two. -huh. Has more character. Two, in their mind. Doesn't take anything off. It makes demands and it sees that they are met. What other letter has an adjo, bodyguard, carried in every... word. In your mind, cue belongs to me. With your exes, your wise, your sentence. Letters that do not care what anybody is. , don't just do not be any word. In cue, of course, is the first letter of the word that can't spell quick, perhaps. Please, some public radio, yeah. And Evan Harrison, a friend Shelley Roth, started talking about what it means to be able to be able to kiss. What are the qualities? And they decided the qualities were that kind of fierce independence. In fact, they saw in the letter Q. They talked about putting for a long time that day. And and I Could have quarterly just came out of my mouth really. I mean, I just did came out of my mouth. I mean, it really, it kind of came from heaven. , kind of came from heaven. Really, it just kind of lit down on me and there it was and that's how I saw it. Quitter Quarterly. At that moment Evan Harris and her friend Shelley Ross decided to publish a little Z-Rox thing. Okay, just one. Quitter Quarter. And that changed every time. Recently, I heard about butter sculptures at Minnesota State Fair. These are these big sculptures made entirely out of butter. And often up. I think it's the way it was explained to me was to do often of the  the queen for the day that some teenage girl who slept with us They are me that day and then her her bus will be done in butter And God need to think what if my muse Had called to work in butter, , what if my muse said you will now represent a human form in butter , what if your muse calls you to do something Hoki and out of date  singing in coffee, I don't even know. The point is, we cannot choose. We cannot choose what we're interested to write about. We cannot choose our news. And quitting was a music called anchors. She had read another thing before pretty curvy, but then ideas came out in a trickle. We should work, but we're ready. It was  this inexhaustible fountain, the standing in front of a fire-hunter. He then forced full blast coming out of it. It really came all at once. I mean, I really sat down to start writing about it and it really, it came out and it seemed to have already been smart. And the way that Evan Harris and Shelley Ross write about it was so evocative and funny, that after just two issues with this tiny little z-in, I could afford to leave the z-in. and it was named Zina the month by Sassin. , problems you're saying. Hi, bro, to low-brow scale. Soon, I was your head-in-writing bro, which is going to be out the screen name called the quit. And all this was happening because Evan Harris and Shelley Ross went not just writing that book. They were inventing an entire philosophy of theory. Where the code is , it's scientific. and pray into the properties of food. For example, the euphoria of food, the euphoria of food. Quitting euphoria isn't kind of good. I don't know how much you have heard, but there is a incredible charge to quitting that is  a drug. It's a life being in love, kind of. , except it's being in love with a decision. Evan Harris. He was writing about written and thinking about whom. And gathering the strength fit for job and her boyfriend and which by the way she did. And at some point in this entire process, her view of the world began to change. Quits and the energy quits seemed to be... She would go out with a friend for coffee and, of course, talk about all this quitting business you're speaking about all the time. And then the friend, the matter who it was, would come out with some... Store about something that he or she wanted to fit. We started to see  the engine that made everything in the world around. The way I see it and thinking about my own life, I see it as being framed and narrative of it being pushed along by fit, by Chris. So that my first big fit was to leave college, I was going to the enemy team. And then my next big fit was to quit graduate program, I was at an enemy team. job. And so now I have quit my entire life. I want that to quit. I mean I've quit my voice-in-I've quit my city, I've quit my job. And I have nothing left to quit. And so really now there's nothing to do but do things again. Do you see what I mean? Yeah but you see that as if you're just building them up for what will be the central fact of your life which is then you're gonna quit them. That's right. The way I see it is that. there's sort of  two basic big, important concepts. Okay, and the first one is that nothing lasts forever. You can't not, there is nothing that you can do. You can do it, never, nothing. That's it. And then the other big one is that you have to be doing something. So my feeling is better to will fully quit whatever it is and then go on to the next thing that you have to be doing is better than something. Then it's just here. what it's on the part. The quitting cycle. In everybody's life, there is some thing of a quitting cycle. So you can talk about, , adolescents being a time where people start, , quit listening to their parents. And then maybe, maybe, in people's mid to late 20s, they start quitting places, or even quitting people. And then later on in mid life, I think that there's... there's a little bit of a quitting thing going on, which some people call them midlife prices, and I would call them midlife credit. And then in older adults, I think that they do quite a bit of quitting too. I think that they basically quit giving it down what people think of them and quit worrying about certain things. There's the quitting cycle and then there's the sort of nature of critters, which I think is important. I don't think quitters are lazy people necessarily. I mean some critters are probably  saying, but I don't think that the essential nature of quitters to be a CC. I think that the essential nature of a critter is to be able to cut their losses and the loss. Quitting is about being willful. Quitting is about having one's own goal of the show to do. whatever. To read the question why it is a word-quitter has such a bitory of concentration, not culture. Because I think of the last of my solid word-quitter, and it was a cover of a magazine with Ross Perrell on it when he pulled out of the presidential race, and the word-quitter was above him, just a notion of being a quitter was so that was the message of it. The word critter does have a negative connotation. And that's something that I would really  to change. I mean, I would really , I would really  to keep you. And I see critters to people who have volition. Quitters never win and winners never quit. And that's completely untrue. I mean, really, the more things you quit, the more things you're going to do, and the more things you do, the more potential you have for success. I mean, I would say the critical order of the as a thing is definitely pro-quitting up here. I mean, absolutely. But I'm not so much describing, well, maybe I'm describing a little bit what puts CEO of life. But I'm not interested in your mental. I would say that the anatomy of an action. will quit with very, but the general form that would be that you could have things about it, you could have decided it's more dependent on the person who's and then there's the post-putting stuff. I'm just going to stop that right there. Are you following this particular point? But let's review those steps again, okay? The anatomy of the quit. The quicker things about it, step two now, the quicker things about it, some more. To me this indicates somebody who actually has being an anesthetic, you do actually. you don't just think about it. It goes on for a really long long time before you actually then do the book. Let's let's read it. It's been a thing about it, put it in its knowledge. No, the putter crits and then there's the post-winning stuff. Let's get away with all the map. No vibes. People who have come to see the world too. a single idea. People from whom all interaction can be explained by some scheme. And it can be a bigot. , it can be the laws of supply and demand or fundamentalist Christianity or structural list in wisdom or it can be small idea, . The need for everybody to do aerobic exercise on a regular basis or the danger of oxidation or CIA conspiracies dating back to day of news. The woman's death has not been a conversation when a train was playing at a party or in Los House, with some earnest, face person, all of evidence and theory expounds at length of an idea  everyone on the earth would just stand on his or her head for an hour a day. There would be world peace. If you talk to Evan Harris. for a while. She'll tell you about the great quits which have driven world history, how in fact all the wars in strife of the millennia are in fact better understood as a series of quits. And as some people will do, they become obsessed with a single topic. She sometimes delves into quitting issues and is so esoteric, so air you guys, that it will be hard, I think for any. What else? Not just understanding the particular about them, ? For example, she was trying to figure out a system for how to rate the importance of various types of quits. She had actually created a mathematical model to do that. That the cheat was working with. And during her interview, she repeated several times. That quitting had a life of a zone. A life. Separate. many of the quits that you might make or I might make or I might make or I might in her mind it's in the feeding, it was almost  a living thing separate from the actions of human beings. Quitting itself has an idea and your particular quits, one quitter is particular quit, sits in to the world and all the other quitters in the world. And you have to remember that your quits and influence. Another person's great potential. The point of putting this is to move in the world and to be a bigger and bigger as a person see how I'm happy. Sometimes I just don't understand what I'm talking about. What am I talking about? You have to understand, this is so on my mind. I mean, I think about this all the... I think about this all the time. I'm thinking about getting up and walking out of this room right now. , I really am. I'm thinking about how things change yourself. No, I don't think that's true. I do not. I don't think that's true. And I think that people have to see themselves in a swim, or not with. in a sort of quitting, in a sort of quitting, in a sort of quitting with other swimmers, with other people who are quitting. Right. Right. Yeah. I have to say that, that when you think people should be aware of themselves as being part of a world of quitting, , , who are people who are quitting, and a whole idea of the notion of quitting, or I'm just saying all of my life, you're the only person that was having that sense of that right. All but you're so wrong about that. I, oh well maybe not wrong. Hey, am I really the only person you've ever met who could think of quitting in this way? How you yourself said you didn't stick to him by quitting in this way before that work? Right, but just because I didn't start to think about it before, I'm sorry, it doesn't mean that no one else has ever thought of it before. How long are you going to run? How long are you going to run? You're going to be interested in me. Yeah. I don't know how long I'll be interested in quitting. I think maybe what you're suggesting is that I'll get a lot of my system and I'll be over it and it'll be done. But as I said before, I have quit everything. I don't in a very little way have anything to quit anymore. I have no city, I have no boyfriend, I have no home. Not that those are the things in life. I mean, no I suppose I could quit smoking already. know, creating things that bads me here. There's a lot of little bits that I could execute, which I might do just to type me over. But the thing about quitting is that it runs on the cycle so that now or soon, not click, but soon I'll be building more things up. Which I will quit, which I will quit. Sure. Yes. Image? Hissing?

But, usually I just text me, I will kill you and I will get married. And I will get married. And I will get married. So, exactly. If there was a couple of X-Mag. should quit its relationship right and say this is what you want to qualify. This is a grade that was just heard and he lived the years of guiding Peter and these are real people and this comes from a very unusual sense of the head here called Shut up what I'm in. It's it's called that because one of them is always saying to be a shut up what I'm in and the recordings were made by the neighbors, the next or neighbors of these two guys that the next one is Raymond. Peter. This all happened in San Francisco in the late 1980s and , as they say in the liner notes, the apartment building is to place those buildings built at the cheap one town, very beautiful awesome. It's mostly this. Within a week of arrival, this is the neighborhood. Within a week of arrival, we were exposed to what would become a dependable routine for my name's universe. Evening charged with a literant ramps, hateful rangs, drunken silly things, death threats, and the sound of wrestling bodies, something against the wall, simply into our husbands. fought with the raging abandoned and total disregard for everything we built. The two guys, the neighbors, who moved in, ate eat these sausage and each of these are the names. They started taping, raining here, and at first they just did this because they really thought that at some point somebody might try to kill somebody else and they thought it would be important to have real evidence. I'm gonna say in the 90 notes. The first crudely recorded session featured a monologue by Ray, and my name turns off Barry's desire to kill. Do something so naked. We will sinister about the recording that we were shocked, mystified, at the same time, and still didn't us 100 for more. So these two guys, Eddie Vsassage and Mitchell Dean, made these recordings say that they actually never figured out if Raymond and Peter were a gay couple, or if they were just straight romance. It is clear that homosexuality is the minds of Raymond and Peter a lot. and unusual amount of time to ramps about how much they hate games. But they went by so much that you really begin to wonder, what is this obsession? What is it about? , you just get that kind of me things that we're able to test too much sort of feeling very early on. But I digress. I bring it here onto this. Our radio point has to be done. program today because it includes warning signs about when it is time to quit our relationship right now. The thing about this couple is that they get into a kind of fight that only very well established couples who are married and work that get into. And then it's a fight which begins with the smallest fact of daily life. They literally actually get into a fight about cutting their tongue across. And then suddenly everything is writing in your tongue. Everybody's pride, everybody's 7. Everything is on it. with this light or depth for lossing. When you find yourself in that situation, it's time to start thinking about maybe I should quit this relationship. I did see you trying to cut your toenail. I don't want to see you cut your toenail. So why would I worry about it? For God's sake, I got a bottle of wine. I don't know why you cut your toenail. You have to do that. What do you want to do? What are you doing? I think we're working real hard. You can do that. What are you doing? I agree with you. I don't know where I was. Where I was. I was on the beach. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I was watching that. So, you can't face you when I'm on that. What's your name? Don't do that. Get out of the water. Get out of the water. Don't be. You go sit down. You really get your hands on me. well yes okay KontraI you you hold your hand freedoms From the OO moon to the sinking wave! I have a private vehicle, get your life! Get your dirty little ant, you always take a boss with. You don't have a decent vehicle in your life. Keep your eyes closed. I'm a decent, shut up, old man, you are not. Why don't these guys quit? I think part of it and I actually think one of the most striking things about these rooms is the intimacy of these arguments. Are you in can be one of the most intimate things in the community? It is mutually shared, known. I'm going to put you up one more cut that really illustrates this, . And the chilling is the right way to be disturbing in the middle of a... Big argument, one of them is so inside the other one's head and no so much about them, that at one point to humiliating, he starts to call him, wins names. Try, try, never open, open, make all, I don't understand, I don't understand make all, I don't understand make all, I don't understand the trauma make all. Dragabbi celmi Stouddime I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. The other cruelty of that last comment is this just done. Correct it. They do talk about leading each other, but they never do. As Evan Harris says, the stage is quitting, you think about it, you think about it, you think about it some more. Sometimes you quit and in their case, you just... to keep you in a bad mood. Well, we invited Lisa Buscani to come into our radio at Cornell Sender, where the piece about not being able to quit something on your son's lawn. Lisa is a Chicago poet, and this is kind of a, it's more of a prose piece than a poem, it's kind of a prose piece with the poetic tendencies. It's got a couple of sections and here's the piece. Part one. One. The morning again, my head, stoned down to an unbearable bed, burning, and to the cup. My eyes  their little shut, blinded this with him in emotion. My arms and legs were lonely to have a metal burn down to their sense of memory. These needs to be very tiny, gets me dead. My body's this is a function of small, mhm, in the sudden i been dead. Thermal weapon. I would probably shout in the rest. If I did that, I felt a little bit uncomfortable. I don't get me wrong, I have nothing against work or say. The concept of joining you, showover to showover with efficient and enthusiastic coworkers, to sculpt problems, practice, solutions, push-up, onboard, always onboard by our honest sweat of brown. Is it tracked? I think of well-instructed women and business suits, but ones who really know how to tie, spark, dashing through airports, cats that last flight to Rome, man-handling up potential empire of crashing crisis and spending and exhausted yet satisfied overnight for the company FNZO-NA. I think of Post Office Bureau, said 1950's Communist propaganda, strong textured geometric man in the stoic blue of the overall network shirt, revvently sold. open new land, courageously braiding the hell of the forge, lifting their running cheeks and angular chins to God or government simply deeply thankful for the job. That was worked to me. Not the salary conslagration I went to every day. I worked at a small trade journal with the suburb for a hand of various layout writing tasks. It was a tiny firm. A mom and a part organization will. starring Neona Helmsley as mom. The publisher was a shrunken, shrewish woman in her 50s, the kind of woman who thought the word, brawn, was a bad honor. She fancied herself the last of the old Chicago newsies, barking her wisdom for stuffy, wimble, his office, her cover sticks, sweating off the gin glasses, her nose, one, of an endless ply of base stained with jingles, slings, dangles, from clipped with lispom. Her mother was this. y'all. and Yeltsimura. If they're there in the next morning you've lost your touch. It was as if Satan had made a foray into human resources. She stood over my shoulder constantly criticizing my work with raptor, waiting  a blood-mouthed tiny nest of the moment when I choked up in the area. And when I did scrub as employees inevitably do when told they can do more than else. If  over me  Joan Beast to the question. It's not capable of presumption that I could be right, that I can't have opinion in theory. Any argument I spotted in my defense was deceptive, mocked and he came. That's all. I'll can one question, who's the moment when I'm on the floor in the street tab? It was better to tip my neck open and let her drink. As far as I was, I couldn't just leave. She paid me 12,000 dollars, even with the second job on weekends I really got lost. I really would have. I felt  restaurants in the throat. The world seemed to narrowed, because it was a world that couldn't stop me. My friends nicknamed me four and seven, I won't be ashamed of that. I bought the sheets through the possible sheets closed available for about five years. My flat muscles was cancelled. just introduced to the bottom part. This way, the child taught me one thing. I would end life a little or no option. And after a while, I was incapable of imagining myself in many of the short-sounds. Forget about my policies to grow your health, experience, and pain. This result was always new. It was all about speech. Inobrave. The barking came in a new time. Two months later when she said it was her. She told me she wasn't going to give me this. Herases were given on merit and golf. She said, my work did not merit. The room was suddenly very, very, very light. It was almost too bright and room to live in about Wednesday. Dear one, dear one. I was amazed at your calm. I stood, walked to my desk, took my office keys off the chain, and walked up. I did not know what I was going to do, and I said, I did not care. I sat quietly on the train back to the city, feeling my back must slowly run out, and I felt stomachless, six inches in my heart. One, started in my cheeks and so on. I've done my fingers on my fingers. I love this expo with computers. We try to make it. It felt  I was swimming all day. I had to walk in the breeze. I didn't. Peace is a fine traveling.

Perhaps my God is clearly trying that the way it can be. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What? What? Love. When we started eating out, I was thin. My face was a dime. Nothing will be back. I'm closed, not my lack of money. I was waiting for someone. I got a question. It's a question. What is this? Our conversations used overlap and delved to it in a winery medication only would stop the grief. Great pictures limitless features, expensive and setter, that's how we talk.

It was one of those great scientists that you carry in your throat. You couldn't quit it because this was one so easy.
