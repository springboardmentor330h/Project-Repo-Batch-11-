  "text": "WB EZCHKOGO, the Public Radio International, it's a American life in my class. The friends, let's begin. The Bible's pleased book Exodus chapter 32. God has just brought the Israelites out of Egypt, so the prayers and slaves in one, the desert. Moses is now up on Mount Sinai, God is getting the 10th namens, and it is taking while. And although evidence of God's existence, couldn't have been clearer, just days and weeks or split the right seat with them and they marched across. He drowned perous on you for them. He punished the Egyptians with foils and loathees and frogs. Even though God had done all that, now they're in the desert, Moses's gone. And it's been a while. And in a certain way, in this moment, these real lights are just  us. Applesitians wandering around, wondering what their future will be, where their God is, even pairs. So they go to Moses's brother, Aaron, and ask him to make some gods. He collects some gold, makes the golden count. God learns about it, and he is not happy. People go scuttler probably into the unappeared story from there. God is going to kill everyone. He tells Moses that he's going to wipe him out, and Moses intercedes. It's one of the greatest dialogues of the Bible because Moses pretty much convinced that this is God not the destroyer because he doesn't believe it. people will say this now because I think this is the problem. So if you want to maintain this, you should maintain it. Thank you. God apparently it's size that he wants to protect his reputation. Of course, the thing God is, reasons to the whole thing that we will never understand. Whatever, in any case, God has mercy on the 3000 people. God can have this ascribe. And this turns out to be up. less it that happens again and again in the Bible . It's made over and over and over and over again throughout the different contexts. As soon as you get into the historical books of Bible, the pervasive, continuous and pre-publicity of God and so constantly every catastrophe is understood in terms of value conditions. First, now, to the human. The idea that you would have a God who does not want you to worship other gods, which seems to put the normal to us. It's best if anybody can tell at the time of the Bible that is a brand new idea. People in that part of the world at that time must have seemed to worship plots of gods, God who did not care of the rest of worship. And it turns out that it is not an accident that it is a golden calf in the story of worship, in this key moment in the desert. His message on Spencer will be as dosentito. and got into anchor dictionary of theology. There were many traditions in the ancient era east where people did indeed worship a calf or a golden calf or a bull. The sometimes were calves that were made out of bronze, there were sometimes calves that had either a silver or a gold alloy on putover the outside of them, and probably the story was intended to set the traditions of these were  people's feet, as are  people's apart from those who did indeed worship the golden calf. Indeed, at one point in the ancient Near East, in Israel, there was a division between the Israelites, the Northerners, and the Northerners went off and continued to worship the Golden Cap. But the Bible that we have is actually the sacred text of the Southerners, and then got in the long so great from the Northerners. In the Southerners version of the story, the Cap was clearly a pencil to God. At a magic moment, the story taught him the perspective. of the Northerners. At that period of time, the most normal thing would seem to be what you were supposed to charge you for two years, that is, in charge of architecture, in charge of architecture, now see what you have these miles of money. Dealers. From their perspective, you need all the help you can get. And, for being a golden cat, that would be a fertility thing. For utilities, what's going to be the most important thing. That'll be an alien, that is not very... for. What are the story of the Golden Cap? It's how, by and large, we want worshiped false idols. It is a deep impulse within us. Powing to the honest says that there are hundreds of years of religious icons and paintings and saints and all sorts of things, but of course they are not intended as idolatry, but the come perhaps in the same impulse to see a representation of God right here in the world. Nobody gets up today. And I might hear me here, but I do sometimes, they will be very staffed with Saint Joseph offside down in the backyard if they want to sell the home. And the point is that if Saint Joseph wants to get out of the ground, he will help in the selling of home. It's that kind of use of an image that is actually, you're not supposed to be called and manipulate the body by simply using sedites. But People need tangible things. We have mental, we have scapules. We have all kinds of things because we, we are people influenced and we  tangible sun. And many people have sold their house very quickly after staying. Very missed that to me back here. But today on our video program, people were spending. go to cap today, bowing before worldly things, when they should not. But, for the time being, in three acts, act one, bowing before the famous story about an accidental exchange of poem messages, one of the most famous singers in America, kind of to people looking to be healed. Act two, that's our worship, no other trousers before me. If you're in trouble, do a pair of pants. Isn't it so easy to bear thing? Is that so wrong? Back to me. Don't have a golden cow. A couple tries to get in on the San Francisco real estate. Boom, passion, move up. Put the sort of results that you might expect even now. Give them the theme of today's program. Stay with us. As one, bowing book with a famous. One way to measure the fate, the pure old passion fate that we put in celebrities, is to examine. What we asked them, this next story is a vivid and rare glimpse of that, which comes to us only through a kind of accident. And a series of phone announcements. And happened to tell us this story. I've known Josh since I was 16. We met in a way. We're in my sister, Mary, his brother. Josh has been a Willie Nelson fan since he was seven. His mother loved the red-handed stranger album and played it all the time. Josh remembers listening to it while he lacks a living room furniture for a dying. He's been to dozens. with the Lillian Nelson concerts. And 20 years after the first part of the music, Josh decided to pay tribute to his idol in rather unusual way. I had a roommate that was moving out and the film was under his feet. And so, would we sell up the final film bill and he moved away? We call the film company that didn't change into a clip or go to the address. And the telephone service person asked me What name do you want your caller ID listed on her? And I thought to myself hey, this is an opportunity to make that name say whatever I want And so I said let's have it say willing Nelson And she check off them. She said no really what the M.D. one of your caller ID And I said willing Nelson that's one of my roommates and And so So I never found them that it would create in Beyond Calls. Oh my gosh! You're eating some poison in time. I'd  your singing voice. You should know it's a better thing. But move up down to where we are, where we are, everyone here comes out. Every hour, every hour. I can't believe it. Then let's ask. I think that I wanted to do it. Not so people would think I was. I was Nelson, but. So when I called out to others. I think that on their car I did show up. Call from Willie Nelson. I can call somebody up and say, hey, on that Willie's house. I'm calling this number. I'm going to tell you where I'm driving. I'm driving really, I'm calling back. I'm just as I've pictured in the only man I could be the first. I don't remember. I cannot wait it. I'm really sorry. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it. I'm gonna find out where you are. Oh my God, he was roaming in the bush. I bet you are. He's gonna call me Northern Eye. And he's gonna call me Northern Eye. I can't wait to talk to you. I'm gonna call back to the public. I'm ready to talk to you, saying, I'm not from now. And I'm not from now. And I'm not from now. I'm not from now. I'm not from now. inflammatory Center's we're missing, absolutely isolate from the Center's executives at junt est 殭 plant these children are so cute and easy to see right You are lying may ever have seen that one A long return call on top of his life. If you're there, singer, the place on water, singer, please call me. That you didn't look at, you want to appear, they all had one. You probably have missed the long time back. Okay, here's your note. And you'd  to call my number collect. I would rather . But will... ... What is this? This is my highest amount of food in the industry. That was some kind of a big amount of food. Some of the food are fine, so I'm going to try it. We'll work that, come on back, we'll come here. I'll leave you one, I think this is the last time in the world. I'm going to kill you, bye. Hello! This is a clock from the house. And then the other becomes the door. To the third door is the door. So it means the third door is the one. So the door is the door. So it means the third door. One. So the door is the third door. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Three. Two. Three. Our save messages because they didn't know what to do with them. They didn't know how to get them to William Austin. He didn't have William Austin's phone and crew. He tried to get it. He just couldn't. Sometimes he was home when people call looking for the real William Austin. At first, I just said, no, no, this isn't the William Austin. I don't know what to tell him. Now, hey, maybe you should look back of your latest album, send her letter to the letters. Oh. But then once in a while, I would take the call as if, yeah, we'd reach the house of Lee Woong Nilsen. I would say he's on the road right now, but no one's right thing I can help you with. So we would get into a dialogue and do it. We would keep moving, but this is really the house of William Nilsen. They would ask who are you and I would say I'm just a friend hanging out on the house. Josh told me that over the three years he listed himself as Woong Nilsen. He's probably got... in 500 calls. Pigtimes were around Willie Nelson's birthday, April 29th, and the Fourth of July, which is the time of Willie's annual picnic in looking back Texas, and Christmas. People call him nursing homes in mental hospitals. They call it silver and they call it trunk. They call the meeting something, they thought Willie Nelson could give them. A lot of people call him meeting something, if he really knows him. AI. Ah. Good. You don't know me, but... Go fuck yourself. So they're about coming down and if you have a couple minutes to visit. And I'm currently really struggling. Are you really going to help? I'm looking really, very sick now, sir. So, it's gonna be a very nice day, Mary. Did you notice? I had something that night, so... So, it's my daughter's daughter, very very little silver. I need you to help me. Please, help keep your eyes on the camera. Here's her. Your headline is very important. It's your own book. We'll also have some rather looking print material. Please return with all this very very important. A few people just went really nice and to remember the time they met. I'm not sure if I can find it. I got it. If I did not get it wrong, it wasn't wrong. But I was really wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. Then I would have caused that one to non-general questions. I was wrong. This is the drurgy car jab that lusks upon the chair. Please try that at cruises. When you get there, you're now moving down the technical. And I have words for a song. I don't want anything. I just want to hear what you call a song. And I want it. I have to wait. And I have to wait for it. No. But people will listen to this thing. And I don't want it to be so dire. This work is to take off this way. I think that people connect him with kindness and gentleness and they want to be sooth by him. And my feeling is that we really probably get more of these calls in your average cylinder because he is so to kind and gentle and has that aura. But I don't know what to do when I hear a call  that. Those are the calls that... make me glad that I am not myself. On three occasions, Josh tried to forward important sounding messages to Willie. He got a concert, work his way backstage, and give the information to a security person. He never knew what the message was got through. We'll leave this as a little more. I live up in game safety and I've been thinking a lot about you lately and some other is in the off-settle and got delivered to the E. A lot of times, three years ago, delivered to the E. And I've got some ideas about how to get to the E. We've got a few instructions for when you're late. Let's talk about what's the liver transplant program about how we've been doing something. Some of the things that we've done earlier and I feel comfortable here. I feel  we've got it. We're late. I was able to contact Kenny Morris, the man from the same situation. I used to prize and embarrass to get the call. He hadn't told anyone about how he tried to reach a really Nelson. When I told him Josh's phone list was fake, he was an angry. He said it just seemed  a prank, although in his case a rather cool one. I asked him what he expected well he Nelson to do. He didn't receive this call. I expected to call back, , I take my attention, , I think. It wasn't that I, we got the crush defeated in call back, but I wouldn't want. That was my own choice. And I thought, it might get some kind of a hard-tour when you heard it, miss. I had this fantasy that he would come to the hospital and make my mother and that I knew that she didn't have long to live and I thought that's probably the best thing I could get to, or if we really know she would have come in there and sing her song. So it's jumping out and saying trying to reach for something that's kind of thing that feels the least,  that you have to drop. Can you say that looking back, he realizes just how crazy it was to think that William Nelson might come to his emotional side. But he said that back when he called, that was a state of mind. He was grieving, and it made sense to him. Even though he didn't reach William Nelson, even though he never heard back, even though he actually had the wrong. He says the call, my name is Sonny Good. It helped me. Let me hope, what it, let me tell you something about a bad evening from. I was probably in a pretty loudest age. , I just left my office, I was just realizing that my mother's six eyes were the same thing as a walk inside of. I'm in that telephone number and being able to leave. that means that he's probably helped me. Now let's probably gave me a little time for my mind to allow that night to allow me to get my sleep. Yeah, thank you. I don't think Josh would ever admit this. But I think that he liked getting my way now so he's calls. But as Willie Nelson sings in the song, my heroes have always been cavoised. Don't hold on to nothing too long. I came home from work one day to find my answering machine light blinking. it frequently is, and hit play. And the first message that came out immediately, I recognized the voice. I have this disperse Willie's help. And I'll just try to yell, see what you're hearing. who are here real aim is to really use what we've asked you. That's just not very ever split up. Maybe you could give me a call. Thanks a lot. Have a nice day. In a way, this is a fan's best and worst case scenario, both at the same time. Your eye wants to meet and he's mad at you. The nicest guy in North America hates a one person. It's you. I caught up with Willie Nelson after a concert in Baltimore for a very rest interview and he was too robust. You just wanted to make one thing clear. There's just none of this guy's business for these people who tell it to me. Turn it around. How would you  for people to be picking up your messages? It's not something that's personal. There's just none. You can't be able to see. Who do you men eventually spoke on the phone? in my mind announce aanglish. While all roe boards are already one of the most affordable portals of every year. Lily was polite and invited Josh to meet him after a show in Austin. Josh met him backstage. Lily was gracious and forgiving. He asked Josh to stop. And so he did. But for Josh things were different. Yeah, I guess I would prefer the relationship we had prior to that, where it was more of fan and icon. I could still look up to him. He was still sort of an untouchable. I have tried to listen to the albums and not think about the phone number. I've been so much successful. Certainly I got to meet in face to face. We got to talk and connect. What I give that all up for a return to the fantasy. Maybe I would. I  a lot of things you call Josh's. younger. Josh never wanted anything from what we Nelson. But by listening himself is Willie Nelson in the Austin, he unwittingly put himself in a situation where he eventually was forced to see Willie Nelson as a man, not as a celebrity. And the fact is Josh liked it better when he could just see Willie as a legend. It happened to be some fights now. At a time, on the world, seems to be spinning. Hopelessly, how long to throw. There's the sea above and the sea above. Owling between us. That seemed how, no place to go. Well it's the same old song. It's right and it's wrong and living just something I do. I would no play. I look in your eyes and I have power. I'm so... I'll do it. I'll do it. There shall have no other pants performing. How much power can a pair of trousers have over us? Kate Mitchell in 1990. It was working in psychiatric hospital. Oh my, Massachusetts. In the moment they met, Joe liked Kate. Kate liked Joe. But as he sings happen, it took a while for you to figure this out. A mutual liking. Kate spent a certain amount of time figuring out how to get in good with Joe. I'm sorry. The embarrassing thing is that basically I would check the schedule at the hospital each week and look ahead to the seven days and find shifts when I was working in Joel and then plan my outfits accordingly because  I really want to look cute and one of the things that I That I always relied on was that I had this Paragene that I thought was really good on and I would purposefully save the genes After laundry to the day when I knew I was in London And I was , well, fine, , I'm just a tall. She did have this one pair of pants that was totally crazy though. The pants seemed not fitting with the rest of her. So it always sort of threw me for a moment. Describe the pants, please. Well, they were acid wash. They were awesome. I love that. They were acid wash denim, sort of speckling white, tapered at the bottom, , the ankle, and a little bit, , quick. It's a little bit loose, a little bit little puppy. And they ballooned out and it diced sort of shot per-e kind of way. And the super really crazy part was it. It was what happened up near the top. They kind of, they had a fold over front area. The feature of the pants that I thought made them really mean is that they had the top, which kind of picture it. It came up pretty high on your waist,  a good. for inches above the belly button. Okay, but at the very top of them in the front, they rolled over into this flat, this big flat. And they were just, they were really cool. They just had a lot, , there was a lot going on in this deep. , I don't want to pretend  I'm in some critical fashion name, I'm not, but, but , these were not a good comparison. What was the original context of this pan? Some picturing avoid. George concert maybe the case. Yeah, you got the time right. I think I bought it. Well, I bought it. I remember now. I bought it in a store in Boston, but I'm probably late 80s or 87s. And I  that. In this store that was very kind of just 80s Boston clothes, which is just a certain look. I mean, it's definitely got a little banana ram thing going on, a little bit of boy George. Yeah. But I'm still dragging them out at this point because I'm thinking they look so good on me. And I  it so much. So, one of my strategies was that I've seen what we're working in evening shift together because in evening shift we're more likely as a group of people to go up for a beer after and that was  that would be a golden opportunity to live pants because we're on and then you're going to be out afterwards, , in bar and just  I've got a whole evening of these pants at that point and I know I'm in the just gold. Do you remember any key dates were you with the pants? A key date. The first night when it became apparent that Joel was interested in me was a night we had an evening shift and a bunch of us went to this bar and the groups started dwindling and dwindling and dwindling until it was left with just me and Joel. I was wearing the pants that night. I was a very successful night because that was the night when he was making eye that me and I could tell this is going to go somewhere. He's going to ask me. Really, so the actual night that you turn the corner with your husband and and father of your child, you will bring pants. I guess I was. And that's right. That was the pivotal night on which your life turned from what it was to what it is. That's right. Well said. Joel and I began dating and I'm just very, very happy. Because , he's just a wonderful person and I can't believe, , it's worked out. And we started. So we're gone along and we're. working together and dating and it's reached, I'd say we're at about four months at this point. So we're dating for about four months, but it's at that point where relationships get where I think it's kind of ,  that I mean it's not super serious yet, but  that this is going to keep going, this has a lot of potential. , you're both really very into each other. So we're at that point about four months and Joel is actually over at my apartment. Cates in her bedroom at her apartment, going through her clothes and figuring out which... once she should keep and which one should you give to Salvation Army? And I opened up my drawer where I keep my pants. And lifted the denim that the stonewash pants out of the drawer and not at all because I was considering I'm sending them to Salvation Army, but only because I would have to move them to find the pants on the bottom of the drawer that of course I might send to Salvation Army. And as I pulled the pants out of the drawer, Joel sitting on the bed, kind of sat there minute and clears throat and said, you sure you want to keep. those pants and she sort of stops. Looks  he says, but well, , yeah, I, of course, I mean, I think I do what. And so I say, well, , I just think those pants are maybe a little bit out of style now. Said, well, do you think maybe they're just not so much style anymore? As words are coming out, I see cakes face. Blushing becoming pinker and red. And it's , what? She sort of pulled it to the hand and looking at them and looking at it and looking back out in them. And I realize, , these are just another pair of pants these were the, , these were the special things. And then I, I mean, it's a very uncomfortable situation for me because, , hey, again, I'm not a pretty professional guy myself. , so I probably don't get any right saying this to anybody, but then being, , this is the woman who I really fall in love with. , and this is  one of the first moments when I've had to say to her, there's something about you or something. There's something connected to you that I don't . I couldn't believe it. But these bits, then had , I'd been purposely wearing it. and for so many times and I thought we had done such a good job for me and he was now saying I should put them in a bag and put them on the curb basically. You thought that the pants had actually done and jumped on him. You thought the pants were part of your arsenal, part of your power over him. I knew that they were part of what made me look foxy. and there he was basically four months into it where it had worked. we were together and he was saying the pants are awful. we're doing it or sharing this with your partner. Yeah. Golden Cap, the story of the Golden Cap from the Bible. And I believe that story is this question of is the act of worshiping something? Does that have value in and of itself? Even if you're worshiping the wrong thing. Right. Well, I think when I talk about it, we do mix-beating yes, because by worshiping these, by worshiping the pants, they gave me confidence, which gave me some, I think, a long degree, maybe, of attractiveness to this person who ultimately I was trying to attract. Because clearly when I was walking around those pants, I was feeling pretty hot. and I thought it was great. And you put that way because of the pants? At times, yeah, how much ever worn something to slap? I was good right now, ? Do you think you could have gotten Joel without pants? Wow, gosh. I hate to even have to think about it, I know. You think the pants were that big of a factor? I don't know, I mean, , it's been 11 years, but maybe those pants had something to do with it. , I have to ask him. I'm... would have fallen for her and she were showing up in granals every day. Say, or leisure, so there's something you can do. And as anybody knows, there's ever fallen in love. You eat, eat, eat. You idolize the person you're falling in love with, and they can, in those early days, particularly, they feel perfect to eat them. And then you start asking yourself also questions also for this experience. Why would this perfect person necessarily fall for me and accept me? Why would you be with me? But then when you discover a chink in that. for the first perfection, for this, you find a flaw. This case, , K had bad taste, at least in this one garden, pants. But as somehow makes you feel a little bit more comfortable. Feel , maybe I do have a chance here, because God, then you have those pants out of chance. 3, 2, 3. Go back to this one! ... What does this mean?! plus This is reaction when he sees the cow and the dancing actually is an M.S. dancer. He gets rid of the new 10-man. It's brand new freshly-bred and 10-man, the Sprakesan Food Mountain. And then in verse 32, Exodus says, and he took the calf, they had made and burnt it with fire and grounded to powder, scattered upon the water, and made the people of Israel drink it. If I have to think of that happening to those genes, I'm going to be really depressed. That they didn't deserve that. Yeah. And I really wouldn't want to drink them. Okay. And of course,  what I did, right? What? I threw them what? I gave them the salvation army. Did you regret it? I kind of did because it was , I thought, no, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have, , if we had been going out for a year, and he said it, I wouldn't have done. It was that four-month thing when you're still. probably gonna do the things please the person. But, oh, where is he here? He just , yeah, he's already around here. , yeah, I got the door these days. I thought we still be wearing him today. Ha ha ha ha. How lucky for him that he got you during that brief? No. When you actually do what he wanted. Exactly. Exactly, I'd be sitting in them right now. Oh rononon lvl st., what ronononl購 tractor. You missed the jeans. You're torn right I do. Those were great pair jeans and they're gone. 1990 at the real way. Someone maybe happened. I recycled them because I was showing them. So, , hopefully they,  what I hope is if they brought some power to some vehicles. I don't know,  I'm just trying to picture a dude of the bottom. The salvation right now. Somebody might have picked them up. maybe some local theater companies doing the 80s version of God. It's version of God. spell. They're doing the breakfast club at a live dinner theater and someone needed to wear them for the Alish TV role. Look, all I'm saying is if I still had them, you might see me walking around on today. They're gonna come back by then. Hey Dan Joel, with New York City. They're now public old daughter. You need data line and some faith. You imagine that Tom position control is with the names take it back, ? The taste issues. Where there are other strong contenders who are out of high-knock sweet. Yeah, there's one I wanted to eat in one. He thought it was tech. That's here. Now I'm dressed, but I  the name Tatum. I'm stuck in the A-smeat. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Coming up, the eternal question. Money versus P. which is more powerful in a minute and all of our three-year-old listeners in the year after that public radio international win our program. This is American Life on my last. Each week in our program of course we choose some theme. We know variety, different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, Golden Cat. There's people worshiping false gods. And whether that is always such a bad thing. We have arrived at Act 3 of our program. Act 3, don't have a Golden. and how what show about worshiping false gods would be complete that story about money. Or real estate or happiness. Fortunately for us this next story is about all three, these scam, false tail. When I first moved to the city, Chronicle was about a story about the donut shop in the corner, the one with the huge sign and probably planned open 25 hours. The story of the paper called the corner where the donut shop was, the epicenter of Chronicle, made that for all of SAMHSA's code. It was a staggering idea. I would sit in a donut shop and try to imagine climb, disturbance, discontent, greedy eating outward across the entire speed in the very spot, 25 hours a day. This is later, I moved into my friend Jimmy Sassin, the alley behind the donut shop. Got to sit back and watch it off. On St. Carlos Street there was a daily sweet satin position. never ending the black and black wood that could watch their precepts. There was the sound that meant pushing through bar cards and the alley, playing their bells, and there was that tenseness and no sound. The props cruising slowly, the wrong way down the alley. To grow down the street that I had in crush on, the walk by, short sleeves and the mission sun, smiling, sleeping under a morning coffee at one p.m. So, when you need a joke deal, I would walk the other way. Looking exhausted, sagging against the hauntry with being attached, hard into its weather trough. By as time hasn't uncertain, Gen. Carlos with six A.M. just put the street woke up. Steering down the alley past tired, all the historians, shoes dangling, childhood minors, I could imagine 10, 20, 100 years of six A.M. is all exactly  this beyonding and stretching past. It was a working past street, you had to alley. Place the problems that the police saw, but pronounced the sleeping dreaming. With the mission is changed. Streets that had been called down and out were now called three missions turned into peety motif is now fashionable. Turmite ridden drapial concorians were bought and exorbitant prices passed away with it to immediately resell and gain her to stocks. Everyone in San Francisco had a dream to somehow hitch and realistic. Stock market was pumping so much easy cash in the neighborhood. Good times were so good that dream even had a name, meaning up the mission. with the self-leading that their ordinary dreams actually will force rise and rise to the fall boats. Our landlord up on the hill had bought it in that dream too. Our landlord, who I'll call them, is the dollar looking contact with the guy, self-employed electrician, happened to call him a house. When I think of Maria Sae was thinking of this sad, black, mustache and schools, standing in the driveway, because my roommate street came home to the supermarket and sued me in the school, So we seem to be thinking, how did this happen to me? He had bought our house eight years before in a parody James's 10th. San Francisco's record show about their stronger tilt that few as part of legal mind. Marriage. By law, to be in the race, go to their grand, Jim Stoke, sweet, mighty, great. In the 12 years Jim had lived on San Carlos, he promised much of part of the streets. street signs. So, everybody knew Jimmy. Even the gang kids dressed in blue shit there has a lot to read down for a lot. Jim was a self-employed scavenger, so a trash boomer, a white war between glass. Almost guys came by for both blankets. Jim's friends came by with baseball products, super-range projectors, or a PA for a protest and center . Usually for everybody up. Here's also a long time they put a bar in there. Just about everybody in the mission. got a beer for Jimmy for later. Even though the mission district real estate bullmonged in Kashmir news, Maurice never seemed ambitious enough to try to have a victimian passion. But he was married to Claire. A sour, always sneering woman of the immobile aspirations for her own. Claire hated Jimmy. He's easy to imagine for up there on the hill, working on Maurice, telling him he's any kind of a real man. He'd give her to that woman and trash sales, pretend to his, they sell the house, rich. Maybe she wanted to do a Vittas, moving to our house, turned the up and coming mission, and now had belly and hearty. We knew that Marisa's first wife had left in several years of her and other woman. Maybe Marisa thought that if he got left behind, it could get rich with housing market, where it would be too. Whatever he thought, our house was now something else, simple of some brighter, well-heeled future. It was a chance. A chance for her headpacked with electricity, finally could have did, to be with the action ones. It's not just a small time to be with you. And all they would have to do is get rid of us. We always paid our renon time, it had no problems with grace. It would be nearly impossible for legally invictus. So, the rest hired him to coerce the ruthless and sharp- addiction trial there. A man so stereotiply vile that when tenants rights protested, or staged demonstration he would come out and greet him, waving, yelling, smile as videotaped. in action. Breast is hot shot lawyer, never lost a case. He had a secret weapon, a little known law of the LSAP, then allows the man to pick their tenants, the landlord takes the property and the rental market forever. After they evicted, the landlord's sell the property, move into it, and turn it into a Pagga, but there is one catch. The property is re-wrenned anytime in the next 10 years. It has to be offered first, had the old rent, to the evicted tenants. This was not a big deal. I'm pretty sure that the house was not a big deal. though, as most people, the LSAC, the speech, the rights, the rest will not be played. The lawyer served the victim notes as to us and earned out of spirit games. We've been a month, the neighbors have taken 7 students. She made a side of the higher lawyer and the fighting for the boys. As long as the lawsuit went off, she needed to live in the house and she decided to let her friends. The reason why we're talking is so their house and the early leadership. That's it. right now, it's good to see. The first month is off. Jim City could hear them through the wall of Gagling having sexy bathtub, something  an option, absolutely. They were clearly enjoying their new lifestyle and research commission. Playing the part of Wokey real estate lovers and shakers. Clare had taken the slippers of the cars, she would stand on the porch, sneer with great satisfaction with some art of sport, saying things , happening but... finding a new place yet Jim, better start looking, they would have their one friend over clocked and blouted in front of the house but on the sea riddles. But I actually felt sorry for Chris. The mission was no place for this kind of Uberous. The electrician was in over his head. It was about to be George. George was the homeless guy who slept in the upstairs with the said George was just some homeless guy and he said Jake's near. George had reinvented the role. With his trench coat, it grew seabed, and wild massed jet flagged, where George was more of an ominous presence, worse. That's so much a harbinder of doom that a reminder that you were doomed, or feeling a hangover that no one's been part of saying how a street, no one's been being. While everyone else in town was worried about a fiction, George won the streets in concern, as he was, in fact, in charge. He slept anywhere he wanted at any time of day. He would go to the pizza club. his corner, put his feet up on the sidewalk table and throw his head back, surveying his domain, and throw his thinking eyes. He would not buy a thing. Instead, he had the power to assess taxes on passengers' body. If you had a six-packed Georgia, you'd always get a cold one off. You'd get him to cigarette, Georgia, stroke, and speed it in the old. Give me two. Georgia also left NASA and Thursday for a garage door every morning. There was nothing you could really do about it, who was pretty good about going in a bucket and going out for him. Thank you for watching! decided to see if he could figure this out. Maurice had lived on Burnell Hill, a nice neighborhood full of kindly older lesbians for everyone always seemed to be out walking in dogs. It was a pretty part of town with trees and views, nothing there, paired with George. We would sit and drink beer on the steps and watch Maurice paint up after George. After a week or so of this, he installed one of those annoying security good lights in turn on and if he would walk from there, say, 100 yards. We were blinded anytime we walked at first steps of the night. I found my Instead of if you just unscrewed the bulb a little bit, it wouldn't work. But one day George came by and Jimmy asked, what he thought of him and he laid. George said, oh I love those things. I can make sure I have all my things together before the  goes out and go to sleep. After that, we quit on the screen. The case dragged on, we switched George stretched in the months. The recent clearance friend came over the lesson when I was in there. I don't know. Go from the hot shot attorney was marooning, sort of money in. the neighbor who wasn't exactly the same mission. Now, the horizon tie was going to lift all boats in the mission, at Tyler Napey Money, the yearning. The most visible nightly example of the so-called economic revitalization is that the people pissing on their garden at night had a more expensive clothes. I'd come home to find giggling drug girls in those huge shoes from pants down, being away in the driveway, while their boyfriend's drinking and trying to take all of them to inspire us to give them. I saw people mastering the art of listening to the point-handed. talking on a cell phone with the other. The Latino working class bars in the mission had all been systematically closed by the police because the patients were cracking down twice with each other. They had been replaced by hips to bars with the patients all they'd co-op and they went out to try to fight us. I'd see whether a coded sideburn wearing guys, scoring heroin, and it's a deep mission to think, yeah, it's  these people couldn't wait to move to geto and lose their mind. Doongles Please apparently press levers. The next turn begins the very thing that might make him rich, property itself. Possibly inspired by the high ceiling white wall glass that I was kids were interested These days, we started cutting the downstairs interior, ripping out the solid redwood cabinets, countertops that you can construct it over a hundred years ago, out of trees, bright over our ships from the zero. Crackling ship is stood up with three major earthquakes, building a not-so-of-a-lifetime mission in this day, Chris. The legal case, if by this time, dragged on so long that it was no longer clear what really might be. Bruce Lee Blair always locked inside, on her security alarm, eager to check in on the officer of crime from year 24 hours a day. A bunker  paranoia ended downstairs. When there, following his work, he said, he got, looking, looking, looking. Well, here's your problem, he held his legs, very great box. Racing. there was happening. Later, Swalka's view of Parking, Driveway, and then before Punching through his go, head. Soon after that, there apparently, there curiously, he's scored a bite again, man, carried her back and opened her door for a punchy gaze, lying in the middle, more sexy than the bathtub, and there is. After that, we almost never saw the race, except when he gave him the word, the synems, and there was a boy. And as per Jimmy, the block he had lived on for 12 years changed considerably in a short turn. 3LATCHING OF FAMILYS DONE OF BROKE IN THE BIGGRED OF THE ELISAS. Now their full-merhazes student will be their more valuable memory. One was surrounded by a rubble where the owner and her children can carry it into a bottle and run out of money. Some of our friends just gave them up and moved to bed, including the girl I had in the press conference, just to be smiled at the weekend. There were no weekend garage sales anymore, James. No one really came by to hang out on the steps. Well, it had anything that was not bothering me. It was just more affectionless. After nearly a year, the judge will against Jimmy and hasn't moved out. Various is winning deputies in some monumental four-page list for over 70 years. staggering backing of an almost-curtz- collapsed mission-line pass-free. He accused us of having our house open at all hours day and night so that homeless people can just come in and wash their clothes. One innocent time, Claire Pound Jimmy's two male friends, working on the car and the car. garage was described as a 4G. In another complaint, the race accused us of quote, dragging heavy items across the poor all night, and to quote the sound. Well, it was easy to see by the judge who was ruling us. The race was just trying to do what he wished for, his whole property, the Indian 70 found himself at the center of the sort of vast avant-garde homosexual conspiracy. A mission network with the unpeen and unhoused history of the sh emerged it was the 4G am archite. That's it man. the only wish we were that cool. The day we moved out was the only time that I had actually saw a priest's in Sasha and 30. Everyone was there waiting for the shared to conserve upon the Aperus. The priest came out and happened to step to wait. The player finally pulled up, shipped bird by the impromar. The player pulled up and his S&P. He was the only one smiling. He strode confidently to the top of the stairs looking at him to the alley, he was about to address the current in the walk. the most powerful explorers. After all, he'd still never lost a case and he'd built the personal fortune from the one tried and true samples of school idea that went all way back to the personal rush and the ultimate talent was found on. You don't get rich planning to build. You get rich selling new vise to all the tools to show up here every day and full. The Sheriff finally came, papers and hands, the lawyer led him up in the world house, but a moment later they came up with the use. It couldn't find Jimmy to serve in the apes. For the first time of work. was here to return to us in Groud where the hell would he go? Just then Jimmy came out of the house next door, casually said, oh I'll take those. Thanks. See a couple days before Jimmy and work got a deal with Groud next door and now Jimmy was moving into a room, very next house. Jim said, hey can you give me a hand with his plants and the recent glare watched the stunned display to drag the platter boxes across the driveway and Jim's new home, a mere 10 feet away. They knew they would be able to rent the house. to anyone who should be for 10 years. He would be right next to it, watch it. Three stood at the top of the steps looking at across San Carlos stream, the street with problems that were linked to this. How could he have known what would happen next? That within a year, the real estate boom, bus, the stock market, the founder, lost with San Bacon, all over town. How could he have known him in a few months, he would move out of the house. soon be covered in comedian trash that the driver would be full of homeless guy sleeping unconscious in the George moved top of stairs. How could he know? He got rich quick scheme would fail and that he would be unable to even sell the house. No buyer would want to rent it to Jimmy in 1988 rents. I don't know. I'm a look on his face that day, top of the steps, and tell the breeze didn't know. He figured it out at once as his high-pid lawyer got his essay wheels fed away, as the younger mayor opened the card or the chair in Jerova. to the house of all his, somewhere George was staring for his morning rounds.
