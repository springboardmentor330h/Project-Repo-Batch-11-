  "text": "Hello to this American Life listeners, I'm Vascia. In these last couple weeks of summer, as I near the producers on our show, now I'm the field doing reporting for the fall videos shows. We've been here on the other planes, favorite episodes, the first few years of our show, Vascia experimented this morning from our first two years on the air. We're going to be back with news shows, including a show that we've explained the entire health care system in the United States. Nothing, very soon. Brett was standing in the subway platform after the Russian one was crowding. We noticed this guy didn't seem home once he's in close. Stopping in front of each person, looking into his surroundings, seeing something, and moving on to the next person. Turns out that guy was telling people that you could stay here. They had to go. They were in or they were out. What did we say? Well, literally it would be if you were out. your gun, your gun, you're okay, you can step. And then do people leave? No, not at all, I mean, and no one argued. Right, wrote about the instant. I'm just personal website, great news. You may ask you to read a little bit of your account of this from the website. You write about the who he'd cited to keep me to the title team too. Right. This is the last few people before he reaches me. 50ish woman, business suit, big glasses, some narrowly dismissed. The homie and the baggy shorts, she caught her bulls jersey, makes the cut. The young even with her mother, who seems not to grasp the importance of this woman. Let's give you a hug. Oh, versus you, who's grasping, is how important this is. Why? The book is shaman in the maroon, cutting it sweater, falling in red face. This cut loose would protect you from rubbish. The book is shaman in the maroon. There is something about the judgment of strangers. When the clerk in the record store seems unimpressed by your choice of cities, when one cute person on the bus gives you a look , how do I weigh? It is it, by their status as strangers. They have some special instantaneous insight into who we are. Evisions and crowded by our people attempts to charm our friends and people we work with. The guy, that course of the bread. I've started to people with them. And where are you going? I'm going to go, I make the cut. It sounds so silly. We all  to think that we're all, , not mature enough. But there's come to show that we guys, you guys going down the line rating. I found that you can't help but they're kind of hope that he gives you the thumbs up when you're turned up. But bread, he's not choosing you for anything. No, he's not. He didn't even look  anyone I particularly wanted to hang with. , I mean, it's much too much to let's go. tell someone you didn't really feel any need to impress us. No, no. I mean to me, it's , I think you're right because this is the poorest case I've ever heard of literally speaking you. For nothing. Right. And yet you want to be chosen. Exactly. Inspector... a little too close to him. He walks in his eyes and says, You can stay. And Brett felt, You for it. A smile you for sure. In his mind he knew there's no reason to feel so good about this. But in his heart, He made him feel really, really happy. It was , all right. You wrote in your account of this. I find myself against my own better judgment. Now looking with some disdain and perhaps a change of pity on those who didn't make the cut. Sure, I mean, I can't make this guy's cut, come on. How terrible you write to be excluded, be found unworthy. But no one has ever claimed life to be fair, well, what happened? In a sense, this guy on the subway was committing a perfect act, kindness. People who he gave the thumbs up to thought good. People who he told get lost simply ignored him. It's a simple act of kindness from stranger. Today is Radio Program from WB EZH Kado and Public Radio International. It is this American life from our class. Today on our show, stories of kind of strangers and what it leads to. And for the best perspective on the subject, all of our stories today take place in the city that has the reputation for being the unkindest city in America. New York City. At one of our show, stories and finds a mate in which a good deed is done with the hope of a smart. the word, back to, run away, in which a small good deed leads to much bigger things. At three, the unkindness of strangers, story about a neighborhood, tries to make life hell for the person next door, at four, chairman of the clock, story of 150 people who don't know each other, attack the answer, do your cops, and practice them off. Stay with us. At one. Parasand finds him. This true story of a good deed someone tries to do for a stranger comes in Joel Costman, who is a locksmith, a new one. It's a little past midnight, and I've just returned home from dropping my girlfriend in Deborah, off the deer one. Late at night is the only time I'd dare,  the way my block looks. There are no panhandlers, parking lots will all empty, and the constant noise you hear in the daytime from the exit you link in the tunnel drive because minimums. It almost looks  a real street. place where people live. Remarkably, I find a parking space right in front of my building. I sit in the car with the motor running listening to the radio, thinking about Deborah. We live together. This morning, I thought we were in love. Tonight, I'm not sure if I'm ever going to see her again. The DJ plays a Freddie in the dreamers team. I'm telling you now. Suddenly, I hear someone across the street yell some. Look up. The young woman is standing next to a red sports car, her head resting on the roof. Damn, damn damn damn she moans, pounding an alternate fist down with each word. She steps back, her hands on her hips, and looks around as if her lost child. She has straight blonde hair, which hangs down to her shoulders. She's wearing tight blue jeans, a yellow shirt, unwutten down to her cleavage, and black spike heels. She's got on bright red lipstick, and gold interlocking circle. for earrings. They jangle when she turns her head. Oh damn, she says again, and throws her bag at the car. It's a portion. I shut off my engine and get out. I don't want to scare, so I call from the cross the street. Excuse me, you need some help. She's bending down on the sidewalk, picking up some things that fell out of her bag. She looks up for a second and she's going to scream. and she smiles. I lock my f*** keys in the car she says she stands up. Can't believe I did this. Their hands do a kind of beddy booting. I decide that she's Jersey, here for a concert at the garden, she just has that Jersey boot. You're in luck, I say, still from across the street. She purses her lips and nods. Why? You're going to take me out for a drink till the tow truck gets here? Cadet? glass that starts coughing in the middle. I go to my trunk and remove my car lock out stuff. Pretty stranded Jersey bill with a sense of humor in no less I say to myself. There's something in a face that reminds me of a young just a laying. Across the street with my slim gym in one hand, it's a thin silver-repeated metal about two feet long that some notches cut out at the bottom used to open car doors. I carried it my side with sword. a night work. In my other hand, I grasp my tool kit. In my shirt pocket, it is the little leather case that contains my picks, which I bring just in case I run into any trouble. I step up on the sidewalk next. I'm a locksmith. I announce. I love these moments when I get to play the hero. She has a looping smile on her face, which stays there even as her expression slowly changes. I can smell the alcohol and the lip. She looks at the slim gym and then back at my face. No sh**! She's... Well I guess it's my lucky day. She lays a handle on my shoulders that were old-poused. She squeezes and then leans on me with it. Her head floats around in front of my face. You open it up and the drinks are on me. She says, we kind of have growl. Here into the car window and see the keys dangling from the ignition. There are a couple of empty beer bottles on the floor on the passenger side. I look back at the woman, she's got a cigarette going there. At that moment, from behind us, we hear a long, clear, tarzan call. It's a perfect imitation, lasting about 10 seconds, complete with the jungle yodels in the middle. What? The hell was that? The woman asked. She steps out toward the street and leans her head way back. She looks up at the parking structure. It's a block north and 31st street. I get a real good look at her then. That's Tarzan. She tilts her head to the side. Half closes her right eye and raises her left eye breath. Friendly ears? She asks. I think he works in the parking structure. Oh, she's a little looking at face that says that explains everything. She puts her hands behind her and leaves back. I momentarily think about Deborah. The woman in front of me couldn't be more different in appearance. She's as tall as I am with an accent out of the stilone mood. She looks  a wild, fun-loving gal, good-working class stop. I wonder what she's  when she's so. So you're gonna do your thing. What? The one here. I hold up my swimsuit. Action! Just... I did my slim gym into the car door, feeling around. I tried different angles, different depths, nothing happens. She hops off the hood of the car and stands next to me. No luck? She...not yet. It's a hot night. She takes a tissue from her bag and says, Here you're sweating buttons. I'll wet my car. The tissue. smells  perfume. She removes another one and dabs it her neck and chest. She flaps her hand in front of her face  a fan. I've got air conditioning in there once you get it open. She's allotted open in a minute. I start thinking about her behind the wheel of the car and where we'll go. She rummages around in the bag again, produces pack of cigarettes. She lights one up, takes a drag, and blows the smoke up to her to the sky. I haven't smoked in 10 years. It still resonates from how it feels, how sexy it looks, which is why I think people do it. She offers me no thanks. Sorry, I don't have any can stronger. She smiles, I smile a lot. She strikes a pose that smokers do, right arm bent at the elbow, and then goes to the floor on the cross spot. Left help. rest on the right list and fall on those straight up fingers for lips. I pulled the syringen harder than you thought, huh? Some foreign cars are taught by Sir. Can I try? You want to try? Yeah, who knows? Maybe it'll be  beginners what? It looks  fun. I don't know why but I say sure. I slide the syringen through the space between the window and the rubber strip. She takes the end of it. this, she asked, moving it back and forth with a slot machine here. No, I said, actually, you kind of go  this. Take her hand, move it up and down slowly, bobbing the end of the tool slightly beside the side. We're doing a kind of slim gym tango, dipping in and out, nothing down. Card or won't open, but she doesn't even seem perturbed. It's  we're playing a game. I'm going to try to pick it, I said. I still do this. sure, I'll work on the other one. As I step away, we suddenly hear Tarzan again. It's louder this time. He must be on a lower floor. It's a particularly beautiful call. He really trails out the last note. The woman bends over double and slaps her thighs and drop dash. I love that she can. That is just fabulous. Local call. I take my can of WD40 and move it to the sword. That guy should be on TV or something. I squat by the other side of the car. I insert the tension bar and the sword and hold it down with my thumb. Then I work the breakthrough several times. After a couple of minutes, I'm starting to get frustrated. I'll be right back. I'm going to get something else. I run to my car and remove the metal ball in that bottom canal screw and this very situator. It's long and sturdy, but ploy it. I bring it back across the street. Here I say, you hold this. She lays this linging down on the side. I insert a large screwdriver between the door and the body of the car. Just put a little pressure on  this. Say, it's a push ball. That'll give me room to move. She stands behind me, pushes back on the street. I bend the end of the dowel into an L, and slide it in. I push it toward the butt, which is in an impossible spot on the door of that, just behind the hand. I'm thinking, this car really is... I wiggle my end of the dowel and poke at the area of the butt that I keep missing. How does that button work? Do you push it forward or in or what? Geesh, she says, I don't know, let me think. She pops her head slowly, side to side, and finally says, In I think. I keep poking at the butt. Once I hit it square on, you let out a loop. But when I try the door, it doesn't know. And yeah, slam my fist down on top of it. Hey, she says, come on, we'll get it. She puts her hand on my arm. , you're really a sweet guy for helping me out. She means forward. Kisses me on the cheek. When Deborah said goodbye to me at the airport, she said, maybe you and I should take it. the next few days to be about. Then she put her hand on my upper arm, kissed me and she. Let's try it again. Listen, I say, I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated, but I usually don't have this much trouble. It's okay, she's. I know we're going to get it. She punches the air, but it's you. We try again. I twist the dowel around to get it and just the right position and then push it forward with my hands. they're smashing into the butt. Do it, I do it again. And again, as my body bumps into the woman's and rubs up against, I get more and more craze. You can feel my hero status and value. Finally, after about 15 minutes she says, , I think if I push this way with the screwdriver, it'll make more room. You think it'll be a lot easier. Before I can stop, she leans against the car and pushes. There's a lot of stuff. crowd crack, the window shatters into pieces which fall on the sidewalk at feet. I look at her face, her mouth is wide open, the shoulders raised in the nose. Then, sudden, she opens the door, brushes the glass off the seat with it back and gets in. Well, I gotta go! She starts the car. I don't know how to thank you. She speeds off the window. Goodbye! She calls it. I am stunned by the swift and stiff archer. As I watch your drive off, for hand, waiting out the window. Tarzan gives his grand finale. His voice is so strong that it sounds that he's right behind. His call begins with one beautiful, raw, sustained note. He holds it longer than I have ever heard of. Then he leaps into a spectacular trill, which ends with another gorgeous full note. And follows this with this. second true, which trails off to a final view on the tongue. I turned to face the potton's pressure, and standing middle of a pile of my discarded tools and broken glass. I leaned my head way back, looking up at the sky, cut my hands around my mouth, take the deepest possible breath, and yell at the top of my lungs. Shut the hell up! The costment stories of his life as a rocksmith and his book he used to be seen. Back to run away. When you commit an act of kindness for a stranger, where can it lead? 1940 Jack Geiger was 14 years old, not getting along with his parents. Because the odd rules of the New York City schools at that time had actually finished high school, but no college could've done him in so young. He wasn't getting along with his parents. But with him often often. Men. He would sit play. Maybe Sun. I was living for a while since my current situation was in light. The future might have been a mellow. which started Black actor in Canada. And I was very moved by that and with brushes, 14,000, that stage afterwards. And some can't believe in other arms talking in a while. And I liked that so much that I did that three at four times. Do you do the call? What did you say? Did you talk to them about? Well, we started our talk, but wait. which are right in the main character, bigger Thomas and racial relations. And that's pretty seeming that around to the second or third conversation, at least, what was going to my life for that to my campus. So I'm new learned a lot more about me than I did about him. I think that point has got a lot of positions. And then one day when we got home, we just got a lot of tougher. I waited till a Sunday when I knew there was no performance. I was trying to pay my folks around and back. I saw a boy up to Top Sugar Hill in Harlem. Five to five could come every where I knew the camp had penthouse. I went up and rang the doorbell and he was home and I said, Lee, the stuff called, he was just going to do what's going on. I'm just taking a look at my left. Cold, just  that. And he calved around. When he came to college, he moved to sit in my life and sit in the seatbelt there. I was just going to sit in the seatbelt. I was just going to sit in the seatbelt. After I had gone to sleep, I had called my father's, he said, well, he's back, he's born in. But why didn't I say here because I'm not sure where he's going to lay in the next time. And my parents' fusted and so exhausted by all of us that they agreed. It's tended to be. And that was the beginning of a whole year that I really lived there and had one of to agree. I've been through this for years, in my life. I've been through that apartment over that year that I remember. King and Queen of the Harlem, the Atricon, Sparding, Civil Rights, Political, and intellectual world. I had the chance to survive in being after even any weekends listening to. Thanks to you, William Surrey, Adam Clayton Powell, Billy Strahehorn, the Belington Stranger, Richard Wright, who came back once from exile, stopped in. And what I remember most is listening to the conversation about World War II, Grace, Blacknessy, Secretary of Education, Armed Forces, what was happening south, what was happening city. Let me ask you to assess what do you think of parents we actually realized when they got the first coffee in the league. To have to have their white Jewish neck, Christ son said, went up living with black and in Harlem in early 40s. Well, I think they were exhausted. We had had so much struggle. A little later I remember for the run when we were. talking to each other again. Lee was giving a party and invited my parents. Who was great accreditation came up to Harlem and night. I don't think I had ever been before. And came to the party and Canada, I remembered to him, my mother and said, hey, I'm a bachelor at the easy to come up the south. In the kitchen, it was a big party, my mother said, sure. Next day. Talk to my mother, Fawn, and she said she had had the most wonderful time. I spent a couple of hours in the kitchen with this wonderful man and all this conversation. I said, who was it? He said, well, she didn't know she'd never got her name. I said, well, describe him. And she discovered that she had spent two hours chatting with Lankston Hughes. He was. What a fight that she had never realized. What did they talk about? Ggm! You had to have met Langston, used to know. He was as comfortable as an old shoe. And I'm sure they talked about cooking, and I'm sure they talked about whatever else my mother wanted to talk about. And she never quite got over it, still retalled it. During that year, he was kind of in his humble, sorry, good father, and I was in that stage where I wanted to take anything from the parents. So I was fighting with him. So he, stake me, so a bit of my first year at college, my father, please finally let me in. And so he paid for your school? Well, he'd loaned me the money. Instead of your parents. Yeah. It wasn't until a little later that I figured out why unconsciously maybe I had made the choice that I did. It turned out, well I didn't know it. I think that Canada leave himself head-groomed up at a pretty strict middle class West and in the family. And he had told me this. saying kind of dissatisfaction and mixed up feelings that I had about this relationship with the family of what he wanted to do. And he ran away. And I think that experience made him had something with his kindness, taking the streets kid in and making a sort of second form. The thing I thought about is a lot, we're not ever really finding an answer, is what kind of clues that I have that said, hey, this is a guy that I can approach in this way. No, that's probably a kid with a suitcase, I'm a Sunday night and have some kind of shot at getting taken in. I was either very insightful or very lucky and I think it was awesome. Do you think there were clues that you were getting? I think there must have been clues just in the fact that he was a Broadway star, who was hanging around backstage talking with the kid about life and about his troubles. That's signal that I don't think anyone could have missed. I'm a technically cannabooly figure here, sometimes it's to make some deep into it. Jack went to college, and he's didn't merge in the experiment work. Serving on the relationship back happened in critical evoccers. Yes, as well as Washington. When Jack would come home to New York, school break on the matchman's, who'd stay with canvases. Then, I'm on a jackchurch soon. Canvably told Jack to use press to pass, ask for the borough of 1000 pounds. And I said, sure. I wanted to, and when I came back to the next trip, we came back. And it took me a while, and my perspective, figure out his meat and mouth of dogs. He was just changing the nature of the relationship, please. See, hey, now you're growing up, now you're young, and I'm a year-dent anymore. We're partners  Farham, one of the major slits of Farham, one of the Zlaty gas scouts. Yeah. As you can order, Jack came to turn with Benach, active in civil rights movement, 20 Mississippi with civil rights workers in the early 60s. It's founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and later, Physicians Human Rights, he's started community health centers in the city and in South Africa. In this slightly, the South Centers lives River to 9th. That's it. And I've got primary care in 14 months after the last three. Tech大哥 says he never moves so deeply into his blood so quickly. Not waste change. It's a relationship, but obviously the headstay is the only thing that seems, all to fly life and work is one way or another involves someone. He's human rights. Must be one of the reasons why he came to position. I'm wanting to look out for people who are in trouble. I'm not going to be a little bit more. Who's it? You're a passion that other people have extended this kind of act, kind of being that you've been. First that he had yarn or for some, that's a moment. what occurs to me now is that something I learned in the hall of being your dad was using it. was a lot more experience in the black community of extended families. And I don't think in that context from that side of the divine it follows a big deal. You're saying in a way that the black culture at that time was more of a distant standing kind of situation in white culture. I think so. And maybe still. That's Jack Geiger. 19th St. Putna to this story, 1944, and years after the French Jack Geiger, Hanover Lee was in the movie where he did more or less the same thing. Film was lost in the boundaries, because after American police officers were attending, he was white teenager, and his murderers whine she shakes their fingers up. the neighbors and neighbors in the same neighborhood, street mob, a tap dancer, a hea system, and, turn it aboard, and then the minute, public rating, and the actual, when I've spoken to him. It's American life, my advice. He can approve him of course, which is theme, green-red variety, and this person that can speak, and this person can speak. And this person can speak, and this person can speak. Our stories in today's show are from this supposedly least kind city in America and works. A very enthusiastic saying, We have a life-dedact degree of improvement for this act. We figure it, it's niceness. We figure we would need a change in this of kindness and a tempted kindness. And this is a story about the flat out time. And how? Take two people who do not know each other and make them completely successful. All tough reports, some names in this picture. How does neighborhood is today in time and cream? Respect. It's a lot of about search and cream. and then she was moved. And then we started. The advocates as forward record stones, cat nails and body-persons. Star Lee is one of the leaders. She moved into years, right in the story. And they traveled between the start of the ride one. Star Lee says that at first, she was just regularly moving in the first. She would come and kind of tell me that not to make noise in the apartment and she would, , I was slippers at night. So,  you should be first to it. She'd come and just knock in your door. Well, she would tell me a thing down to the hall, and she was also specializing in the second rodec... and she was just always moved out because she was walking into the谁. fairies.... The lady who's on a bike ride has clearly wrote fully twitterly, she just left the clothes in the house. She was really walking out. She was never taken by the car... but she holds the toe. Tw все la feta, her head back- still just went around her. The show prepares. She fits finally十 points and that's why this theater festival PLAYING is set. The resort to every new day. We must take two trucks. So how they do this collections. She was actually really calm about it. And she looked  a helpless old woman back then. And I tried to be quiet because of it. And then I think I even helped her carry  a grocery of stairs one. I think I actually did do that. From Stali's point, she tried to be quiet. She tried to be quiet. But she was called a stupid jello of friends. We were gonna drop out. So it was hard to be quiet. We had this one too. Stali's a chair. We were st... How can you choose to start? She would occasionally sit in a hallway and talk to people about us. But we were not getting one after the talk too. She was kind of  make up conversation and gossip about us. But we opened the door and she looked  they all went out there and they all went out and looked terribly quick. And she wasn't talking to anyone about us. Just so we'd know that she didn't  us. So what's her to think she's saying that? To sit at the rear of loud, bad kids. to see her loud and I'm small to them all. She didn't believe any of us ever wanted to school. But she refused to believe that. I think he's very young. Yeah. How could one of everyone else in building to see the stone? She's... So, she started to  garbage out of her little house. She apparently did try to make fun of things that people in the studies part. And we were three, two, were responsible. Sarah, but... And , it's come to the paper, and I thought, Orange juice, the cartons  that, and it started to really smell and it's got food and she's taking, and she's speaking  so much trash in our way. and people smoke here so it look  we're doing it. And also the type of trash you picked, you try to go the way to find a kid to trash. , postage don't-it-reppers and my candy bar things. And just  the most creative garbage you've ever seen. And so then, so people at first thought we were doing it and they would come and talk to us and they'd don't put trash on  I'm not putting trash. But itffftaholdusbeijw Jake saviorlink She said, non-rubing, so she said, non-rubing. You do your stupid, take the set of your things. J.K. were to note saying, please don't put trash in the hallwall. And I put it outside in the hallway. We look almost where, hall it. And you just take it on the wall. And as then we  hear her come out. We look to the keyhole. And we see that she put a sign up. And we come out there and it says, well, then please don't sell drugs. And that's the first time we'd ever heard of it. We're just , whoa,  we can't, , we didn't, and this is so odd. the blow we believe it. Every since that day, one for six months ago, how does but at least one of the worst things ever seen? Sometimes it's 20 and seven years. The most they pretty small, maybe two inches by three inches, enough to written mark and blockbats. How do we put snow to the front door, open the movaxes inside, on the window on a round door, and start leaves going. The word invariants, but the message is ours to see. Starley is a big time druggeding, just selling drugs in the apartment. three and she should stop. Starting actually collections. What will well on her apartment? Let's cover. Starry shows you choice. See, she puts, she'd number three selling drugs, business is usual. On past, I wish she put shame selling drugs on past, or she was trying to steal her house. Kind of bronzing drugs, the other song, illegal drug. here  parasites. It's got Lisa's impact, she's not saying she's not herself. No one in her parents is a dog. I, I guess when it comes to the apartment and I come in her and you where you want. honestly, we'll go to the pub together and I'll find that all. I'll be doesn't just move so much. Here's how to go on. She harasses those friends, because they're all close to her mom. When she's at her mom, she's at her mom. She's tapping from just the last time she's at her mom. What do you do? Some friends know how to do it. Let's say, sweetheart. It just changed our attitude. made herself suffer a lot, it is kind of a regret to cheat. We were watching a good icon, apparently three hours. first type of that we were going to do a taboo entire time. She said, we're going to make her turn a little bit higher time. Just do it. I mean, she did not detire him. That's what she was going to do. The eating. She's thanks for. It's gonna sad. It is not sad. It's hard though. It's hard because it's hard to know what's the right thing to do is and to be confronted by such a meanness. Because  the more, , someone else that come home with a doctor, it's gonna sad as well. in the world. You'll pass by her door and get , , feelings  pity of action, and then she'll open it and show you how it feels . And , you can't, she makes it so hard to do the right to be a good person, better. So, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it. A couple of views, they're actually wasn't. I wasn't that bad. It's bad. I'm just trying to understand, it's not interesting. People say, and then we're now some building, and then we're gonna go to the court and then we're gonna go to the court. to get there. Tell those ones we can test them and start reading them, that we can give you what's happening there. Tell them that a lot of attention is important for me. It's an issue that I'm going to forget. You don't speak to help them, but I'll just get her sent me to school. But it wasn't easy. The way started we described, she's a specialist of strangers. She never lets anyone in my apartment, doesn't answer me. So that's not how to speak to my own school. I'll do it now. She was very strange. She wasn't on her aspect. She seemed completely wrong. She told me that I had heard something is going on in the park. But I asked her if you would want to. Yes, she would. She said that she would, she did want me to support something today. She said today. She led me across the street, on the way, which is that of a visit. She was deadly science, very intense. She clearly found the truth in her famous story. She was willing to give me a few details of the rest of the life of the victims. It's interesting. The building is for all students. People in the apartment three self-students in the house. They also use the stories as a crime, which is a sub-rugs in the fire and hot in the neighborhood. It's a big surprise. I'm sorry, I'm not sure. If nobody really had a story in the radio, she would tell you even about that moment. That everything is done in the talkings. And somebody had a set of mixed feelings. She said that people are comfortable in the talkings, and she said that she says the problem is that all I am saying is that. But for how long that was the month. Starly is just the soup, stays up late, she's got a lot of bones. There's no middle ground, just. They see absolutely everything. Starly's one. It was a period that the beginning with the soul from the soul of the soul of the soul. What was just a good start? But it's time when I think it's changed. The Starly thinks it's a soul. There'll be time for one. to catch her act so badly. I never caught actually so good. You can never catch a good design up. I wanted to open it so badly. I just , wouldn't you leave for a guy? I've got no, you guys don't have to leave. I'm just gonna, , just leave the bottle a little longer. And it is hard. There's a way, especially at that time. So. Let's go. Let's go. Let's just say that way. I'm not going to leave. Right. Let's put it what? It was , if me lying away to per lying away, absolutely. Let me. we are a great great work that we found aside. ishnathen, they have tons of strangers and they are hypertials. dwotheres of chocolate. With healthcare and starlies weну-thru We will become reality. Thank you! 23fs for each of those in practices of their picture. They have to start these times. I mean, it's not a gun to her first move. If you were in a history of this building and then you would be there. It would go down that it's a hero or a daily trying to get to third doors out. Keep it in the murder or whatever. And I guess it could be perfect. I told you, I mean, almost it's a special time. Well, I'm questioning myself. I'm glad I used it. , East question. Where are you? Just, In my right, In my doing something wrong, Is there something wrong? I'm doing my that. Is she a little bit right? Not telling me to be a little bit right. I'm telling you about my. Just, I just tell you about me. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, Yeah. I've been having dreams where we become very, very serious,  long epic events. I think she's come over and we chat at the bed and we're  people in the dreams and I had dreams where I've seen metaphysics come to terms. A lot of things have been spent with this summer. I've just told you it's me. I've had... , oh, they all look , or dislike, I've been rolling all of them, so I had a bad point, but I was busy and I was in a car and jail, but this time, I've had these  crunchy drinks all summer long. And to the real deal, it's , she's , absolutely self-indulacted, I'd say , I can't figure out when I was just saying, I'm awake, I'd say it, and , I also , with the logic comes in their eyes. She has sat down my bed and he goes , do you go, I just talk about things, I need to do some jellers. What do you mean for me here? You're just just a bit epic. Where are I supposed to be saying, whatever I could possibly say, but we'll  to make it, let's see what you have. What do you think? I think you feel if it is, if it doesn't know that you said my stuff. I don't know, I'd probably wait a couple of days and I'd see it in. I'm not. I can't manage to explain. She looks less. It's obvious, man. Come, come on, come on. I love to be a boy, bye. Back for Chairman of the Law, the story takes place almost around the corner from Star Louise private buildings, who just few blocks away, is about one smart and his consumer completely unexpected. A resident of the native, Blake Esk, was the star. About a month ago, I went out when Friday evening, friends, and village, where we both live. On the street, we heard friends and... music blasting right enough to wait for neighbors. As we reached fourth stream, I saw a hundred people rubbed around the street for the sixth floor tenement. Most of them were post-polished pre-child-bearing types. Plus there were some older people, probably lived over the block. Everyone seemed to have forgotten where they were headed, whether to a party or to another bar, or back to bed. a short dart here, Guy and a suit stood at the top of the suit holding a microphone. At first, I thought maybe the guy was lip-sinking because he sounded exactly  Snatra. But after a few seconds, I realized he was doing herring himself. The guy looked a little  Snatra and he moved  him too, but this was no run of the Snatra impersonator. It was as if he was possessed by the suit. spirit of Sinatra, channeling the chairman of the board. The Frank himself had emerged from retirement, died his ear black again, and was with us on 4th Street. She gets to a great, well, dinner at eight. She adores this dinner, but she ever aroused late glasses at the bottom of the suit, with someone who would not ordinarily see the Frank Sinatra. An older woman with spiky eyes. self-impeller hair and a leopard print vest doing a skirted slightly awkward tap dance when a piece of wood she had dragged out onto the sidewalk she doesn't  craft games with parents and arrows local dress to a party of a bit soft of girls she won't disdert with a rest of those girls that's why this is a center. After my initial confusion in my subsequent bliss, my next reaction was to wonder how this was possible. Where were the cops? The ninth piece sink is a block away, and New Yorkers are quick to explain about noise. And Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made it a priority, at least crack down, for what he calls quality of light pilation  these. Noise, crowds, blocking traffic, drinking in the street. But on court street everything was... public setting, and it still is. Somehow, by some perfect fate, show outside 120-4 Esports stream as having five Fridays in a row. The singer, Nick Tricitis, lives on the first floor building, and the tap dance or Lorraine Goodman was on the floor. Gary and Wanda, run the garden level Chris Shop, put their merchandise, chairs and over-stuff couches, on the pond. But though with some pump that she'd hate, I said that's why the rain is a sin. Nictricitas and Lorraine good men are neighbors, and  most people who live in the same building, they didn't know much about each other. Lorraine did know, however, that Nick had a big jasser in her collection. Five weeks ago, Lorraine decided she wanted to tap dance for the building as the sort of therapist says, and she reached out to Nick. Ask Nick. who's placing two and swallowing up there so that we can get. So what happened was I was coming home. I'll take exactly what happened. I was coming home. That's 20. I'm running across and I got her name. What's down? Who was she? Second half. My old she is tapping. I don't want to do this entire. I'm , I'm , I'm not going to have a reach for her name in my little , , my little pop. And I'm , okay, for rain. And I've walked down the school and I said, I'll rain how are you? See you as a welcome. I've never met him before, and I think he assumed I'll bring out some music! That was it! I was doubting she was expected, , a suit my phone stand, P.A.C.D. to the cessolt enough. We're right, Goodman. This is the brains behind. This wonderful event here. Say good evening, Warren! Good evening, Warren. Nick's initial gesture of kindness to Lorraine, a near stranger, made her into a local celebrity. Any? himself into an even bigger one. There are only a handful of people watching Lorraine tap dance when Nick went outside his instincts to not drink it , which includes a few CDs from the series called Pocket Songs. The discs have the whole scenario arrangements with out of vocalist. The slogan is, you sing the hits. Nick began with, I've got the world on a string. The crowd built steadily, and right away Nick had the crowd on a string, standing on the head of the string around his finger. What a world. What a world. What a lie on it low. What a lie. I'm so nice. Nick showed me a picture taken when he was 15. He's wearing a tuxedo. His hair parked side. Standing in a microphone, pointing back camera. It is a picture of a 15-year-old boy from Pocipsy, New York. And thanks to not regret. I'm basically wondering right now, I have been into South Kitt. So, ten years old. You've got the world on us, Drain, and was swinging on a rainbow. We got this thing around us. Think, don't you? What a world, what a life we are in love. Nick trained as a jazz vocalist and Boston's Berkeley College of Music, New York and after a while, he found a job with the Starlight Orchestra. The 16th East Band of the Forest High Society weddings, for her defense. The Starlight Orchestra has five vocalists, and Nick is their Snotra Specialist. Each of us in the audience have been lured by the improbability of the situation, but Nick staged her at this campus there. Most street performers in New York go where the tourists go, this is most of us native or too busy to stop at least. Nick sang from the street, however, was gifted to his own neighborhood. Nick really... knows how to work a route even when it's not a route. He weafs his neighbors names to the lyrics. And time, he moves through this room and I will all be able to hear a lucky me, I do a great job. Can't just say I'm in Rome. He plugs Gary in one through a shop and thanks to them for their help. He salute to couple watching from nearby pirates game. He dedicates witchcraft to a pretty broad standing in the back. grow and flirt with her at the end of the song. I got it, cross on you! You're fine with this. Just  Frank would have done. Now it's a safe bet that if Nick and Lorraine have been break dancing or playing Pongatroms, police would have shut them down in 20 minutes tops. But the officers of the 9th pre-sync fell under the same spell as the rest of us, and they couldn't bring themselves to get out of control car. to enforce the mayor's holiday flight homes. First week they would circle around the block. Speak to me. Don't be afraid. Say right now. People please don't block these streets. Please keep the streets clear. And that was it. That was  the first second. Really requested someone. Yes. The mega phone has a repasse. The third week. The third week. The third week. And they stopped their car. I looked traffic. And they said, okay, summer went. They wanted to hear summer went. So I finished night and day at where summer went down. And I went from steps. They knew me during the lights and talking to my spot. And I saw some crazy. And I only went nuts. And they were , really into it. Ever did that? Let's just mean it. It is because the whole New York martial Italian leaves Irish street. It is man and  evidently what I'm doing they connect with that. Rust Summer when, Red Game, Rowan and from across the scene. Of course they do. So to the black men with red mocks, the young white guys and the U-Tang-Plantee-Shir's. The teenagers and mercenessly swing around seeing the pop belly Italian bit. or certain age, smoking stars, and sitting front row center, wearing a party colored mumeau, next next door neighbor G, who is lifted 12040 sports street for the last 48 years. For all of them and for me, there is something about Frank Sinatra, and something about how Nick Tertita's introverts drink Sinatra, that be which is us, that touches us. I said, , pay this dice. Oh, hey, is that nice? Hey, wait. Why am I in God? We've got his next work. And he brings me hugged me. This old Chinese guy, now the hearing aid. He's , I'm , I'm a, I touched this guy. I don't know, I did it, but I did it. ? Hey, now they're all the way. And go, went to where they have come and did it. We are here at the door. For any New Yorker to do something as big as this person's neighbors, and then again, is more than an anomaly. This is rare and unstable as the elements of the bottom of the chaotic table. The key ingredients of this event, neighborliness, generosity, free time, good weather, cooperative police officers, are to come by in the city, and they are nearly impossible to climb together in the same place we got for week. The Nicken Lorraine show has had a longer run than anyone could expect, and something rain or the first frost or the 9th beasing, or a Friday night gig with Starlight Orchestra will soon bring it to a halt. There's a cost of all of this to the New York Post in X-Sindi Adams, and it is tempting to resort to her mantra, only in New York folks, only in New York, to explain this for our own honor. But in next case, the wisdom of Sindi Adams. It's not a spice. This is not a stuffed New York. Not a real New York. For even of the New York or the Bikon era. But of a mythical movie New York. A low-reest side block built on a studio back block. It is the first real, an unknown MGM musical, just after the war . And it stars Nick Keneas. What happens in the rest of the film is anyone's guess. Strangers in the night. Hey, guys, Ken, in New York. For a program is produced today by Nancy Updike, in the South, the Speed Control Center.
