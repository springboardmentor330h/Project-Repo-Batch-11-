That's driven to see how, at three, futures market. The true story, our writer Stephen Glass took money from strangers, that selling pop and fear when he got the job as a telephone psycher, a rare looking side that very American business. Stay with us. At one, same name. But when this American life producer Nancy after they started working on this particular story, she was making fun of Costa Pila dovia, named the Ford brand his car. And she would be on the phone with friends personally, and she would mention the story and they say, oh, that God. And God, he took money from me. This happened over and over and over. Nick Ford worked the streets so long, so effectively that everyone seems to be in con biome or new somebody who can con biome. A couple days in the producer. Nancy said we remembered the back one she lived in Philadelphia years ago. She was con fun. There's an unfortunate twist to the story which is that some of the key characters are actually dead or lost. One is a used judge who said I'm one of the courts frequently because it's his courtroom. You have a brain that's beautiful but that brain has been turned to the con. Then there was a little old lady in the Hampshire who got dozens and dust on calls for strangers. Yeah, we're caught by the board. And then there's Nick Ward, the cell. Who was there? No. No. No. No. Okay, the center city. Philadelphia's charmingly small downtown area. Picture a skyline of about four buildings, and then around those 20-squared blocks or so of law, offices, hotels, and those kind of little boutiques where you can buzz in.

He's come down here when he's been at the art store, fashion, and throw it out he's presented, from a face to garner it, the target being a team or the big department store, a gypsy pad driver, and taken his garment design for another sit pick and see it. on a gypsy canvas for a made-off with all the stuff camera equipment for talking to me everything here is left straight. You call the top into traveling day. Yeah, it was a traveling day. One of the directions you can have is, and I'm going to put this. You play it upon all kinds of racial guilt at once. He's black and everyone who cursed the twine. Oh, perfect that into it. I mean, look at all the people that said, and it's a little old  most of the super little class. The so-called people who make the United Way though, and they should get some of the first four. That's not an alto voice to this to it. This is Jimmy McGand, the reporter who broke the story about the four, wrote off the eight-mile. When people would kind of walk quickly away from him, they would call out after them. Go shine me. just because I'm a black male. And this is the stop. The track. The track. As soon as they stopped, we would say that when he arrived and throw it off, he was lost, ended up in here, the University of Pennsylvania, campus in the United White, the University brothers. We're nasty to him, called him racial name, which of course made everyone fit. I don't know, but he said, can you believe that in? sitting at that other level, they would chew the blacken in  that and some of them not me. He was very well dressed in that. His cream shaved and had ice-cream, sweater, leather jacket on. He would often give people to wash. , his poop that he was the real food. So, , whenever it took you so he could offer it every time. So, I know people called, they've been so terrible to him. And probably he's stouting the rug. As evidence of his goodwill, he would take his often in his next wash. I don't know when I'm going to take a look. Every single suggestion that I made can help you. He said, you're on your tribe or the racist. I didn't want to be one of those people. I don't want to be one of those people. And then, if you bought for 35 dollars, you get in your own room, you get to be the non-racist. Yeah. What he was asking for was the price of a drink, and I would have find it as that, find it as that, is it? I've never heard of this one yet. We have married. I've said listen, I needed one book. I've heard of it. If I have to tell my story for  five more people, you get to know how deep you're all about. I don't want to be in the world of the United States. So, let's not get some blog for. So, I went to an ATM machine for about a hundred years later. And I honestly believe, from entirely, I didn't think that there is a... But I honestly expect it. , of course, that Nick did not call. But perhaps you're not fully understanding how thoroughly Nick made this mark, but we... Let me tell you this story. Several months after Bill was caught, he ran into Nick, one Nick was in mid-Spanthusorn house. I made a fool of myself. I came off working with the world. I was walking home to work late for a month. Let's not live. We have a young woman deep in conversation. Without really thinking, I went up to his, very badly composed and hysterical. Outburst, something ,  what I'm just gonna do? No, in the middle of the first words out of my mouth, do not give this man any money. who he is? This is Nick Jerome Ward. a scam artist, you don't want to give him any money, I'm telling you, whatever he telling you is not true. I went on my death for a couple of minutes, she seemed rather stunned and he's doing their very common with him. I would say professionally and I would say professionally and to my pride in this nation. the belief in more than she believed me. I was a jerk for her and that's it. Here's an interesting question. Is what Nick is doing? Why? It's not just the law. Telling someone you want money for a train to get within five. So dinner. is also not this law. Next problem was he told people who's a fat and just made that promise to two of the people. This is how math hurts. The system is not turning to supervising the specifications. If the cases were each looked at individually, it could probably now have the best one for you that we would be unable to do that is not that. I will take that. Correct. You would have to be in a different line of whoever's trying to judge it up. That's beyond a reason. Down, down, down, down. Eight, six, six. There's no one in the house. There's no one in the house. There's no one in the house. There's no one in the house. Someone who's calm is so smooth, so well thought out. Let me one thing to stay. A really strange thing. Actually, the phone number who gave Bill was the same one who gave Dary, which was also the same one who gave everyone. And it turned out to be the actual unlisted phone number of this woman who has retired editor at Macaron Max, living in the capture originally from Finland, who was home sick with cancer and started getting all these weird calls for people to know how to get. And after a while she just started taking down their names, the phone was putting her in the touch of each other. And to finally, she had this database of about 150 people. So Jenny started to write a story about the inquiry and she called this one an up and got all these names which made it this huge story. It came out this paper, a page, top of the fold, everything was put in motion. These two had actually known about Nick but he did busy with serious crimes, got a barrister resting him, nick ended up court and eventually. But what's interesting is that along the way, it's all this outreach. he'd come, through outbridge. The public defend of who worked in his case said to me, bro, I've been a public defender for 20 years. I have worked great victims, victims, terrible violent crimes, that I have never seen kind of vitrials any of those victims that I saw in Portuguese. Gary said he was shocked by the report he was there. All these well-dressed, well-spoken sort of two good or yepy's. Turn into this cheering knob. And Nicholas brought here a lot of people started haunting. Saying hey Nick, what you got to say to yourself now, well now we go quiet as he keeps saying. And I was looking around it before we had the same fun. And I don't think there was anybody there who had done without and not one could have been. And there were people who were saying, hey I gave him 25 bucks. If  that, this is a thing given them the daughters, look your about. , I'm not just from being in a hall, but just the significance of the way I'm looking. Why work was so? Maybe it was because Nick didn't just talk about some cash. He made his marks identifying. You can visit him if he was a member of him. club, the club of people who go to college and have childhood views and who every once in a while just have some random bad luck. People looked at him and thought, this could be my kid or even this could be me. Here's Gare. I think every other thing that he's doing now is not just me either. ーヷ Horst, or does anyone kind of give money to another Living, almost curiosity. But Nick was hitting you as a new thing, or someone who was trying to work his way up to the beginning. What did you think? How do you get money from the street? You become a salesperson. First you flatter than you sell. Next victims  the image per cells, they  the image of America that Nick was offering. Where of course they would help me if Black and the first non-street have said to the trouble. And when the truth of the continent, the Nick took that image away from them. They were furious. There's a way in which you can think of Nick Ward as the agent or his agent. You may not know, you may not be in jail. But you... with something that suddenly entered our mind and made a chance to make a test. Do the right thing or not do the right thing. Good smell. And I think that at the point which people forth over the mind, that we're doing the right thing, they're added to the after that so that they failed the test. The test carries this. Let's figure out which kind of person wanted it. A kind who would give money to a stranger who claims to be a teacher or the kind who turns the back on the street. they don't want to come. Harry says he's not sorry, gave him one, even today. He says at the end of the day, if he has to choose, he'd rather be a suck person. There's a passage in math where Jesus tells us followers, if someone comes before you hungry, get to sleep, or thirsty, get to drink, or naked, close, what you do for the least peace. You do. Stop it right now. This guy is not a seducer, Eddie, but not Jesus. You've got to be kidding. This is Matthew Perks again, the assistant DA who supervises next prosecution. And he was, as you can tell, a little alarm that the direction of something  questions. He turned to me when I quoted this Bible verse to him and said, You're not going to turn this guy into some kind of folk here, are you? I'm telling you, I mean, he's a knucklehead. He says his favorite part of the McBord story is the end. Because that's where he got to come. The end of his life. We brought it off. Just right where we are. Yeah, it's a little bit. This is the longest street about two blocks from where you have square. A beautiful church on the other side of the street. There's ground stone, offices and upstails. The risen crevice are. Matthew took me out for walk along the route of his counter with Nick. And encountered that eventually led to Nick Beats and prison for 19 marks. And then vanished from Philadelphia. Nick approached my New Year's Eve a little part of the day. on his way home and Nick came up to and it started spinning story complete with heart wrench tails. We showed me a little cut of a design told me that he's been robbed and everything was taken from his injured. He hated the adult yet and he had to get back to Massachusetts. So I thought I would take a little time to the people who thought I would love to have a good day. So what happened next? We walked. He asked me for a $60 to get home. I told them I didn't have enough money on me so I told them we could walk through an automatic cell on the scene. What is the same thing you guys do? I'll show it. We can walk. It's one way back. We turned up 17 students. Exactly we're in Nick and Mark. We could walk together each secretly plotting to calm the other. And I asked Matthew to remember exactly what he had been thinking about what's happened. I'm thinking, I can't believe how lucky I am. Are you trying to sort of play the... part of the room. How are you doing that? I knew exactly what I knew exactly what he was looking for. Actually, I felt bad about what happened to him and I was going to try and help him now. You're bringing us your telling us. You're doing remembering us. Matthew's pleasure at that moment. So palpable. You're so inside this memory that he can't completely our counter istg 연�umbri armourreads. and it must have experienced every day. Enjoy it, of perfect deception. Of knowing exactly how to place the one to get what you want. That's in the power that comes from knowing some and better than thinking about you. But this is it, let's see, of the crime. This is the math machine, or drug. It's not going to be a good thing. It's a good thing. The math machine's in it, but. See what I'm going to do there. I withdrew the money and gave it to him. And I made him write down his name and address which I knew to be fictitious. And I gave him my correct. name and address because I wanted that evidence to get confiscated to show the elements of theft by deception to show that he promised to pay me back and had no intention of doing it. And as as as you guys were exchanging addresses this what were you saying him? I was egging in my I told him that I really shouldn't be doing it because I'd have to explain it to my wife so I had to be absolutely sure he was gonna pay me back and of course I wasn't married at the time. right you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you invented a spouse. That's correct. Nothing when I started walking away from your relationship. And I've locked away to this. I still have the pre-20 that you did. Once it is it, you still have money. You're gonna need that. We haven't seen it. Yeah. Where? Oh, just, , sitting in my apartment. You haven't been in a special place? Yeah. So, it's  quiet enough. I thought the record, that's too weird. Now we're on! That's hard! This is an assistant to you. He has had so many cases, much more important than it could work. So why an earth is in 320s, sitting on a shelf and he's a part of the paper book. I'll tell you why, because it's thrilling to take money from strangers. And that is what Nick Ward gave that chance to do. Now, some chips... $60 for you sporting things. It was his own $60. But he took, enjoyed it. Just keep, wait, where are those ponies? Just on a shelf in my apartment. And do you, where you can see them? I know they're there. They're not breamed or anything. You just kept them. Yeah. Yeah. the app deck in orange SAGO.

So when a salesman comes around and says, that land is going to be worth that. Triple is value is three, four years. I think people know that there's a big risk involved in that. And the chances are it doesn't not necessarily have to work out that way. But they want to take the chance. Alright, you can tell what said in these cases these lines, but he has a point. This is the part of a thousand Hollywood films. This is the story that runs our country. This is the nobody who sets off after the least likely thing in the world. And gets it. That is the story. And it is a deep part of our culture. Well, serve out as the story of a businessman who is very successful, getting people to dream. And Taking away money from strength? I once had a job as the manager of a San Francisco Gallery owned by an infamous New York antiquarian print in Matthew or named Grammar Raider. I hung gigantic autobahn pelicans and delicate little 18th century prints of lilies and roses on the wall, wrote Dashi letters to collectors about 400 year old maps of North America, and helped the sales staff try and push promo with the grabs of the grand canyon on the unsus. expecting housewives. It was one of those boy do I need a job kind of jobs. Gran Marator was a kind of fascinating boss who employees gossip about with a mix of actuation and dread. One of those go go go guys who's ambition you could admire while at the same time hoping you weren't the one who answered the phone when he called. Gran Marator the Gran Marator you almost wanted to say is full name every time to make it sound even more  the Terminator. My favorite story about the grammar writer, one printed in the New Yorker, so presumably it may even be true, says that Graham once desired a map owned by a friend. Graham beg the guide for it, so the guide that he needed the map would be loved, this map so much he wanted to hang it over his bed. That it would be the first thing he saw when he got up in the morning and the last thing he saw when he went to sleep at night. Then he wanted to conceive his ch- children under it, at least that's the version of the story as it plays, tell each other. The friend was so touched he sold it to the grandma writer, who promptly told the friend the very next day bragging that he sold it, and for a tidy profit at that. The app dealers just aren't  that, as a group they tend to be polite, bookish, and don't inspire comparisons to Arnold Schwarzenegger or any other. other mythic pop figure. Graham is the map dealer's Michael Melkin. They're Elvis Presley. In financial terms, he put into query and maps on the map and he popularized them  no one ever had who's here for Rizmer. The Antichrain map art before grammarator was a fairly sophisticated market. The people that collected had in-depth knowledge and understanding. I guess the effect that I have. as I brought Matt collecting to a lot more people who perhaps in the beginning were not as sophisticated. And the prices have gone up and I get blamed a lot. What Graham isn't telling you is that he functions as the Messiah of the map this, or its anti-Christ depending on your point of view. The entire industry can be divided by the B.A. before a writer when many historical maps sold for $200.00. And A. a after and later when the same maps began commanding tens of thousands of dollars. His beginnings in the early 1970s sound so American, so go west young man. He was dealing maps out of his dorm room at Yale. And then there's the story about how his mother ruined baby's first big sale. What happened was I'd been working the whole summer by maps of Panopskape for Thomas Watson who was then the... chairman and chief operating officer of IBM and he had never met me. I had met him through by phone and I went ahead and found all these fabulous maps that showed Penobskat Bay. So at the end of the summer I had a mask, this really incredible collection. I was living with my parents at the time. I was 23 years old and when Mr. Watson called my mother not knowing who he was or why was calling my mother said. I'm sorry you'll have to use the children's fault. Mr. Watson hung up and didn't talk to me again for two years. In the years since Graham Arrayner has acquired not just one but many many of his own telephone lines of the galleries he owns across the country. He's a successful salesman. The most successful salesman in his market for two reasons. Kindness and optimism. Let's start with kindness. In some ways, the getting money-waste, Graham or Raider is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Now, some people, people who actually know him, are going to laugh at that. Graham doesn't have a nice guy rep with his competitors. This is a man who, at auction, has successfully intimidated the unthinkably wealthy getting these young into backing down on fizz. That's scary. I mean, the Graham or Raider's rich, but he not that rich. Granted, it's only nice to you if you want something out. But grammar writer wants something from a lot of people all the time. The secret for getting money from strangers boils down to this. Strangers don't give you money. Friends do. Relationships used to tell us in sales seminars selling homes from relationships. Yi Bofs, одноくrian Toys Power. This is Gramminic Ab on the way to Southern Bees with one of his best clients. A guy who looks to be home about 50 years old. You got the toilet. Two. Catch your water soon. What's he got you son? I've got a decent one. I've got a son. I've got a son. Oh my! 20, 3. Yeah, I've got 28. He's up in 4 years. He's been searching for you. Actually, look  you're 35. I got damn it. How old are you? 38. Yeah. I'm just going to say that I'm going to tell you. Why does it mean this? Grand Perry, who is around a small, but well-used tool box of superlatives which he hammers into everything, where it's  fabulous. And greatest and finest and the favorite best. She is a great dream. I spent a day following Graham around in a full two hours of it involved standing around the Madison Avenue house he's renovating, listening to Rave. reviews and he is one of the great great furniture man of all time, the great finishes. This was all white a month ago and Rogers men took all the paint off and that was G's named Lafalo Sally has made this magnificent staircase for me. Why do I feel  you're selling me a vannister? Well is it beautiful? Is it? I mean, would you  to slide down? I'm not a Sarah, I'm a little slow. I think he formed the hyperbole habit by saying things  John James Audubon is simply the finest bird-brainer who ever lived. There may be he always talked  that. Somehow I can picture a five-year-old Graham telling his mother, Mom, these are absolutely the greatest oatmeal Scotch you've ever baked in North America. Which brings me to Grant Arrayter's optimism. The man is perhaps the most talented look here on the bright side I have ever met. Let's start with his inventory. The thing I haven't mentioned is that the antiquarian map market is really a show we say evolution of the antiquarian book market. This is because Grant gets his maps by going to book options and buying atlases that are hundreds of years old and then ripping them apart. Peace out! them as single images in elaborate frames. Librarians of course hate his guts, that he sees this action not just as a no-brainer of business-wise by in bulk sell in pieces, but as a democratizing practice. Only a few people can afford to own a great French Atlas while many more can afford one odd ball chart of Antarctica yanked out of it. I can see grams point on this. These things however old worm mass produced. No of course. there's something unsettling about ripping up a 400 year old anything. To me, the Atlas vs. Matt debate isn't nearly as unsettling as the story these maps tell. Graham erasel's history. He's a passionate historian. In whatever the library instinct of him, he knows as much about the history of cartography as any academic on the planet. In 20 does with all the info and his head that's always astonishing. Me. Grams inventory includes the 16th or 19th centuries. Think about those dates. Think about the story being told in European and American maps that era. Dutch maps of South Africa. Spanish maps of California. It's not just one story, but two. A great adventure of nation building in the promise of the new world, but also quite frankly one of them in warfare and genocide. I don't think I need the top. which of those narratives Graham or Raider spins before his clients. Watching him tell something is exciting, but it is patriotically inspired. He was showing me a map of America saying this map tells the story of manifest destiny. And I'm thinking, yeah, manifest destiny! Wow, what a country! Not a gloss America! And there I'm , oh yeah! Manifest Destiny, or he was showing a client a 16th century book, an actual whole book that's time with the cover and everything filled with beautiful engravings depicting the natives of colonies. So this is the beginning, this book was actually this one, was from the old, John Whitehall in 1685 and in the 1885. And it was published in 1759. And it really is the first image that Europeans had, that the Cherokee's, , creeks, seminal of choc goals. Lovely buck, and thinking that is cool, well, first image of the Cherokee's beautiful. But the other voice in my head keeps saying, trail of tears, trail of tears, trail of tears. Shot from the landscape. That's how they had smoked alligator and lizard and deer. You hear how he caught the deer? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. There's something so aesthetically pleasing about training one engraving, an old mat, or another American money. What could be more perfect than someone paying for that book with all the charities with a big fat role of $20 bills? Exchanging the grave and images of Andrew Jackson, Mr. Trail, appears himself for the story of the Tribes' Sought to Destroy. I'm  grandma Raider, I was never good at selling. I'd be showing a client in early math of self-care line at a hoody looking for his home found or talking about color and I'd be saying out loud, mmm, delightful, but I'd be thinking slaves state. Grandma Raider's America is a prettier picture than mine. It's an easier picture to sell, and he believes in it. That is why he is the best, the finest. the most fabulous successful antiquarian map dealer in the history of the world. Sir, how's the author's book radio on? Think  what master plan? The saying nothing but sweat inside my hand, so I take a two-month hike on my money, spend so I should be, well, still coming up, but let's so I start my mission, leave my residence thinking how I could have get some bad presents in the past, I need money. I need to be a stick up here, so what? think all the previous things that I just said, though, this is the whole, , the whole thousand dollars.
