  "text": "WBZ Chicago, Public Radio International, to American life in our class. And I don't know if you've had this experience. we've all heard all these speeches about Tourgamed War, to the wars and take years, and it is as hard to understand what we're in for. Is it going to be attacks, counter attacks, and American cities poisoned with chemical weapons? Are we talking about a word that doesn't touch most of our lives very often in law? He's gonna command or raid in some far away place, but you're headlines not much more. Those are very different scenarios. What does it mean we get to a war? I say if but , of course president and everybody in a suit in Washington DC is saying there is no if in this point. We're going to war. What does it mean? I'm going to take tries to address that question in 4x. We have a story sorting out exactly what we know right now today. What the coming war will be . Plus to waste about this ecology and life during wartime and what is different from life during peace time. And Scott Carrier, perhaps from Americans, ready to go and die. And some of the children go and die. In this kind of war, save it as. At one, the situation in the field. So it's been kind of confusing, right? For a few days after the attacks on September 11th, we were just on the verge of bombing and teleportation. We were issuing automating them to the Taliban, the sending aircraft overseas. Now, two weeks of gone by and as are we going to begin, nothing had happened. A couple days ago, the restoration from page the New York Times saying essentially, that the US still does not have a plan. Does not have a plan, still is not clear about what might be effective. So to help so that what exactly we know at this point about becoming more, we are thrilled to welcome Tom Jotten, an actual NPR correspondent to our program. He's been covering the story in 10-Gun. in the past. He's covered words in Bosnia, Seria Ivano, Garagua, and Salvador. He says we know the truth has been moved overseas. We don't know the number, but it's nowhere near what we sent to the Persian Gulf War. And I think we also know that more specialized students, even commanded special forces, are on the ground in Pakistan. There are probably American ground forces and air crews in these outer barracks, underneath the kleinen walls. Four-foot hours in reserve. So far. It's  stories, , we used to be, we did a story of a time we bombed a rock. And now we don't do that anymore because we're bombing a rock. I took it for time. So we used to do a story here just in the last couple of weeks. Every time we had a big mobilization. Now we're getting mobilizations every day. I don't even bother to keep talent. We're above 40,000. Other 600 or so yesterday, I think, pay attention to it. And based on what we know, what's our best guess as to what kind of world we can be faced. in the next few months and years. I think one of the things about this is that it's going to be a drama of several acts of it 's going to go on and each act is going to be completely different from the one that preceded it. We are now in the first act and the first act is about chasing the bad guys. It's about going after some of it, Lawdon is going to be dramatic because it's going to go on. going to be these special forces, the American commandos, and there's going to be British commandos that are going to be going through the mountains and they're going to be going into caves and trying to find the terrorist, sighting caves. So that's going to be the first round. But then who knows what's the result of that is going to be? , defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the other day something really, he said a couple of things that were really remarkably said that this is  playing a game of billionaires where you hit the ball. And then you sort of step back and watch what it carines off and you sort of hoped that again, , the right thing happens. I mean, we're going into this war really without any idea of what the next round is going to be and how what we do in this round is going to affect what happens in the next round. And when Pentanton officials talk about these commanding units, is there a fear that these kind of limited actions will explode. to a broader world. How much do they talk about that? How much of a possibility is that? The people who think about this in strategic terms, , and the Pentagon, or people would have different sort of thinking of possibilities. And the people who do think about this in strategic terms are very much worried about that because it's so hard to predict. And we have drawn this in the United States, drawn this clear distinction between $moose collector is But the truth of it is that I think there are a lot of people in United States who are worried that any military action is going to be interpreted by people in Muslim world. It's an attack on Islam. And I have to say, there are those who worry about a World War III type scenario where this just gets out of hand. And , there are one building Muslims in the world. And there are people that worry that this will get out of hand and it will become this sort of global consecration. And how  they do you do the possibility that it will become a war between the West and the sea, swatching the source. I feel a lot better about that I will right now do the week ago. And I feel confident that it is not going to be called that in the short run. Because of all the alliances, the US's been so careful and confusing. Yes, because the United States, the people that are expressed is a... and we are proceeding very carefully. Let's just hope that that focus stays close. I mean the impression from a part, from those who are just, , reading papers and hearing stories and reading videos and TV, is that there's a lot of really tough rhetoric that didn't, and since there's been a very sober and brief rational look at the downside to the various actions, and it actually feels  what we're proceeding in a very careful way. Next, read, show me. I have to tell you, I read there's a lot of debate about this. This is not, this story is not over yet. There are people in the government who are you that the problem of terrorism is not going to be solved unless the states that are in some way sponsoring it are basically over thrown. I mean, there are people who are arguing that this war should be directed against a lot. There are people who say Syria should be coming to our. that debate is not yet resolved. We're still, we're still in round one of this thing. And round one, it's going to be limited. But people say that this is going to go out for years and who knows what round two or round three or round four will turn into. Come, John, come sit, and sit. Come sit, and sit. Come sit. Back to, let us to home. So if we're going to work, what is it going to be ? Let us remember what it was . So that it can't be parallel with the stats in the pot. legacy. Clutching letters and Americans were at home during wartime. He was sent over 50,000 letters and collected them into a book. He says from the Civil War through the world wars, apu, parilla, and Vietnam. Something to this. When every war in the beginning you have this sense of urgency, almost as impassioned desire. To strike back to fight to go overseas. And then gradually as the young people themselves see what wars truly . You see an ebbing way of that enthusiasm. and at the end regardless of the war even the so-called noble wars where it's civil war or World War II you see a great sense of disgust about what war is an exhaustion fatigue just in bitterness I mean so it's just to illustrate this idea of how the letters change at the time I'm going to read a letter to from that are in your clutch and book a letter to pump and it's city diamonds ten and yes this is I love city diamond his fiance, Stel Spiro, and Sidney would say later after he met the style that they were 14 or 16 at the time, but the second time he walked home and knew he would marry her. And there are just wonderful couple. And Sidney was going home about going off the ward, very smart, your man. And he sort of volunteered for what would be a very dangerous division. And he was a very funny guy. And he... wrote these very humorous letters to a style in the beginning of the war and he knew that she was upset with him for going off to fight. And let's start with a letter that he writes on August 17th, this is still in his sort of lovely, and funny enthusiasm to get that film. And he writes it in the form of a sort of a mock, , a war memo. Exactly, it's a talking cheek memo. And so it's subject, Mr. Stelspiro, to the world. Number one. And several of them. There's been questions posed as the rank and authority of the Diamond Combat team. The Diamond Combat team is similarly  him and his- Into their couple, yes. They're the couple. They're together. Also some people have asked about who is most beautiful. The following paragraph supersede any previous bullets on these matters. Number two.

So, this just gives you a sense of his style, his whimsy, and loves that girl, man. He loves her, and there are many other letters  this that are very funny in nature. But, as the war goes on, he's over in the ciphon. You begin to see the change. And, later, write just a few more. later. This is Christmas Day 1944. Now this is up there this is just four months and it should be the letter of where he describes the time combat team. Exactly. Yeah and he's been in combat since. Correct and he's seen when they've gone to some of the islands in the Pacific they've seen the atrocities committed by the Japanese onto the natives. And this is a letter he writes Christmas Day and his spiritually can do well. It is difficult that present to be the cold, the practical, even more is hard to be humorous or laugh, to joke. I cannot say where we are, what we are doing, what we will do. There's been so much between us unsaid and are done, so much of our lives missed. I would  to fill the air with plans, dreams, hopes, but still, all there is is a choking in the chest.

I have 520 odd from World War II and about another hundred from three years before. Do you read the letters of Rea? No. Actually, I didn't. I was afraid to read it until I got interested in the legacy project. No. I read all of every night I read batch and what was that  terrible I would imagine that that reading these letters must have century since it passed I just make some nothing and the semigabins That's exactly right It is only just Do you think things in them now we don't get you saw a Well, they, they, you aren't even mean.

And I see expressions  if I ever come back. And although at the beginning, at least in the first year or so, he will say, I'm coming back, I'm coming back. And then later I see if I ever... again. You didn't want to invest in Dyrin' West. How do you feel about that? What do you think that means? Well, I'm just very much against it when he went. I still wish he hadn't, and it's not because I didn't believe in what we liked or you could war. Damn it, you're bonkers. waited until he was deaf. He was finishing his third year as an engineering student. And I felt he would have had many more options open to him. He would not have ended up fighting with the infancy kit, which he did as a member of the chemical warfare service. And I think he would have had much better chances of surviving. because I can see from his friends and from my friends that they went about a year later than he did. So, I can appreciate the fact that he was acting according to Prince and his ideas and thought it was important to go. Still wish he happened. Deepak he was able to hold on. ideas. At maybe two or three points he says, no more crusades. He says no more crusades than the crusades. No more crusades for him. And then in some other, I think one of the letters that's in the book are not sure. He says, oh, you've got a me, there's a person of love and ideas. And when this is over, you won't have any ideas to content. If there's a woman on, felt less and less, I did this to the body and less and less than I did for a person. What do you think?

On the other hand, I, one lot of wants him to suffer by giving up his ideals. These topics were good and the most important heights absolutely Smash him back was nice. I think it was better for him to feel that he was fighting for something worthwhile. So I can't say more. But when you're the way people react to the idea of going to the spring end, do  that people are embracing it with an illness that can't be called a generation that lives. you can ask for a wood. There's a lot of effects. I guess a day or two after this happened. We went to a neighborhood restaurant for dinner. We were the only people there. The waiter was a very young chap. 21, I guess.

Let's remember Pearl Harbor. I agree. But these times forgets them. When we could tape in here in Chicago, he used to be back. He's called the reading. Right on the M.V. Sam, what is the answer to it? That the particular psychology thing was a massive stroke on, exhaustive, exhaustive, because it was a part of the inward word, too, and might have been forgotten, and in what we can say that. Isn't it exciting? The sandwich and China, so it was red person. Back when the forest still stretched and in unbroken, it spanced from Scandinavia to the Eurils, the Vikings who inhabited its northern most regions, broke down their own stories about wood. They were unsparingly exact. Their saga still often subtlest in most vigorous accounts that the unique psychology of comes. They knew that the experience of being on a battlefield fundamentally different from everything else in life. It simply can't be described as ordinary words, so they devised a specialized vocabulary in the hand. their terms will do perfectly well for a world war for 1000 years. The Vikings knew, for instance, that prolonged exposure to combat can go some men into a state of uncontrolled psychic fear. They might be the most classic men in the world, but on the battlefield they begin to act with the most inexplicable and the two are scruped. They become convinced that they are invincible, above all rules and restraints, literally transform into supermen in wearables. Lightings called such men, berserkers. Will bore two of the spill-bed instances of ordinary soldiers getting into berserper behavior. In battle after battle soldiers on all sides were observed killing water and indiscriminate, ifying all the orders to stop in a kind of collective blood range. They were found in every arm, even among those that emphasized this one, you made a convent. American Marines in the Pacific came notorious for the berserper mentality. Particularly their en All- Qusant. lack of interest in taking prisoners. In his memoir, a marine name Eugene Sledge describes one's seeing another marine in a classic berserkers state, urinating as the open mouth of the dead Japanese soldiers. Another Viking term was, say, people now understand it to mean a semen. Previously at the end of odd, and before that, I'm candy, very, that was back on very well, even the most sense of practice. The old Norse word meant, doomed. It was used to refer to an ear removed that would come over people in battle, kind of transcending despair. Stapes described vividly by American recorder Tom Lee and Mr. The Desperate Pack, her liver and self-ciff. He felt something inside himself, something distinctive psychic urge to keep himself alive, finally collapse, saying one dead soul can be in his trap. Lee wrote, he seemed so quiet and empty and passed all the small things in man can love her hate. I suddenly knew who I no longer had to defend my beating heart from his distance of death. There was no chance. There was no chance. That's fair. People go through battle willing to go up in this, show and stop, and heart will be. And then they feel something in their soul surrender. And they get in and they get in almost fine. It's  a glimpse of a turning. Whether the battle is lost or won, it will never end. It's wholly taken over the soul. Sometimes men say after they can use terrifying moments when you battle them, seeing their faith looking at the faces of the service to their men. Fainace might also explain the deepest mystery of war. Why does surrender everybody's perspective? The Germans and Japanese with them. used to surrender even though they knew the world's loss. It's possible to quiddle about the exact point which the world was decided, midway Stalin ran for late of an hour. But by some unmistakable point, the autumn of 1942, late of the day, they should have understood that they'd been wrong, to prospects for long-term victory was zeroing now. They still had the economic and military strength, sustained wrongies, and field, and but by any rational calculation, they should have begun hinting through backward. or a different nation channels, but they were willing to negotiate ceasefire. Neither Germany nor Japan had a dead son. Not until the last days of the war to be the government even considered and negotiate the son. Not till they'd absolutely nothing left in negotiate. But then that's the point. A rational calculation of the odds is a calculation by the logic of peace. War has a different point. A kind of vast thing is can affect the military where I've seen this losing war. The collective slippage of the sense of objective truth from the face of approaching disease. In the later years of World War II, the bureaucracies of the acts behind lines gradually retreated into a dreamy paper room, and they were in the brink of the triumph and the personal fortune. Not everybody succumbed to these promises, but those who understood how hopeless the situation realized how Gosh at me, this truly offers even a kiwi. was also moved at the feet of the community, and they had a reasonable good idea where we were happening in the same era of wars, and it was done. This is the dreadful logic that comes to control a lot of wars. The American Civil War is another thing. The losers prolong their agony as much as possible, because they convinced the alternative is worse. Meanwhile, the winners, who might earlier accept the compromise, become so maddened by the refusal of their enemies to stop fighting. that they see no reason to settle for anything less than absolute fit. In this sense, the later force World War II was typical. It kept on escalating, no matter what the strategic situation would. And it grew progressively more violent and uncontrollable, long after the outcomes of the foreground conclusion. The difference was that no other war had ever had such deep reserves of violence to draw off. The Vikings would have understood on this. They didn't have a word for the prolongation, or long past and fresh goal. They just knew that that's what always happened. It's the subject of the wrong-distant greatest sub. Or brand-new niya was sub. The sub of niya, burn and ranga. The sub had described trivial few in backcountry. Icedic keeps escalating. The reasons nobody can understand were the sub. Until it engulfs the whole of northern Europe. The location at the fresh provocation, peace comfort and peace. failed peace group, it has its own momentum and a hurricane chronic. For the Vikings, this was the essence of war. It's a mystery that comes out of nowhere and grows reasons nobody can control until it shakes the whole world. This was the course of World War II from the fall of 1940. After the Allies had lasted knowledge, they've displayed the decisive victories. the sound. The axis was never going to surrender. That was when the Allies changed their spend. He set out to make an axis of enemies, the realm. From that winter into the next spring, the civilians of Germany and Japan were helped us before a new Allied campaign, the system that carried bombardment. The Air Force's and air defense systems of the Axis were in ruins by them. Allied planes flew where they flee, they are now 500 at a time, and 1000 at a time. Indiscriminately. dumping avalanches of bombs on every city in town, and this is terrible. We'd have military installation on their loading on the artifact. There was no precedent even in this room for the destruction on its so ferocious scale. It was the largest preserve of rage in history. The Allies routinely got them sent toary bombs in such great numbers that they created fire streams and cities throughout the Axis Confidence. These were simply large fires. A true firestorm is a freak event where a large sentlet. The core of flame heats up as close to the dimoorian 1500 degrees, and everything within goes up by spontaneous combustion. Buildings for water boils out of rivers and canals. The asphalt and the pavement comes. The men's intake warts is bring up around the core and begin sucking in oxygen from the surround nets and burking the speeds. The allied raids reduce cities and minics and miles of smoltering debris. The hundreds of thousands of people who kill at 1% in chill. 10s of thousand suffocating because in the area around the park there's a lot of things to breathe. Out of idle curious, I've been asking friends people my age. They know about war. War stories they've heard from the families. In fact, they aren't the school. Straight images, stuck with their two-degons. I wasn't interested in finding from such a page, the key events, biggest moments. Things people at the time had thought that live on as long as there was anybody around to remember the house. To give everybody a big enough part that I asked about World War II, I figured people had to know the basics. World War II is exactly easy to miss. There's the largest war ever fought, a large single event in history. So what did the people I am? know about the war? Nobody can tell me first of all. Once they got tasked with one hell in the spirit blank. All they knew were those big atomic names. Proharp deity, consciousness, Russia. The rest was gone. Casserine, Nete Gulf, Poregador, Felais, the Ardan's didn't provoke, limmer, recognition. They might Beнд WE are and we are open after this well we are open because all everyone What had happened, for instance, in one of the worst biggest bats that I'll admit me? It was in the Pacific? It was something about aircraft carriers. Wasn't there a movie about it? A couple of people were even surprised here that midway airport in Chicago was named after that, though they'd walked past the economic sculpture and talker for some of the time. All at all, this was a disparity in exercise. of the morning midway. Holt, fatal five minutes on which the war and the fatal world trunk had been reduced to a plaque nobody reads at an airport with a vaguely puzzling name, midway between Chicago and nowhere. Is it that the war was 50 years ago? Nobody cares anymore about what happened in the past. Maybe so. I think what my little survey really demonstrates is how fast the gap is, the experience war in its place, peace. And there's another and simpler reason the war has been forgotten. People wanted it. It had gone on for so many years to exploit so much, killed so many, most US casualties were in the final year of life. When it came to an end, people were glad and rid of everything about that was what try commented about the complex reaction room. in the wild celebrations that followed, nobody crowed, our enemies are destroyed. But even Yelp, we won. They all said instead was, the war is over. That was the message of the question of the illness. War is over. War is over. I'm a live reading from an article by the Sandline, first of all, I'm going to read it on March 19th and 7. Coming up, Sakramam's and Sea Warriors in agreement and ready to apply it in a minute, then we finish 걸 Platinum and Ang The Book of Twips. This is an American live margarine. Today's program is coming forward. We've wrapped it at 4 of our program and 4 are you ready? Over the last week's step period, we've got 2000 miles per step. It's from the surface of the Earth's history. We've wrapped it in Chicago, talking to the Earth. If it's part of the American character, we've found this skeptical. Another part is boldly patriotic. We've found both tendencies. Often, in the very same way. hate is a complex emotion. Hard to understand. There's the hate another people, and there's a hate inside. I didn't bother my heart. Both shown it once by the buildings of Lafzi. The best advice I heard was from a friend who said that thinking was out of the question for a while. But it's hard not to see. And after ten days I got in my truck and drove more. of jealousy. The leaves will be changing and the air might bite. Air is clear, light is sharp as a dime. I'm in setting my arms, I stopped an after my own, and I started out home of a winter gold medal wrestler, D.P. Rue on garden, who was even getting dark, and I saw lights to stop to watch a soccer game and talk to some people in bleachers. Yeah, Shane Ogotsen, we're in Star Valley, Wyoming, it's kind of a small little area. Mostly hot, it's based on dairy farming, but not healthy. I mean, so the question is, is you ready to go to? I think it's scary, and I'm trapped, we'll so if it does turn into something, majors, I mean, I could, should've talked to someplace I don't want to go. It's a part of really one, dude. So you ready to go to work though? If my country needs me, I'll go. I think it's my responsibility as an American, but it's my country. It's good. I'll go out there. I'll treat them. I'll be proud of them. But I'm not sure if I support the exact cause of why we'd be fighting this work. I mean, I think the perpetrator should be punished if I'm not sure if they're going to war or solve that, especially when you don't have any specific real enemy to be going to have. I need to stand in the house, and we have joint. at my 15-year-old son. I think it's really cool. I don't know if it's a place to live, but it's hilarious. Yeah, I would put it. Yeah, I'm gonna have five sons. Yeah, it's scary to even think about if you're going to war. But that's the price of the game. Really have to make your own son's story. Yeah, even if it meant my own sons. That's, , I'll ask you, but all the other mothers would have to sacrifice their state. There will be those who have run, they'd best their choice. To make the price of freedom, that's two-sided. I'd be out for running the settlement who says the wealth of the park. Pull back the roof and sink. There we slept. You and the past is happening. And I'm here next to the top of the top. Yeah, my name is Doug Pete. I'm sitting. But the art goes on on the huge top of the top. If I learned anything to be a guy, just  my mom's. What finally sent me over the edge was... type of fancy. Oh my little achem, I was being brain medic in my little achem. The big con grove of a couple hundred billions across river and our achem, called in the gunships, about 180,000. I have a bit of death at school. Last two weeks we had some spots before. Together bodies and happy spilled on the arch. And through the narrow grip. that either are going to have to live the rest of my life with an eye for eye notion or to retain any trace of humanity. How has that happened in the circle of this? Now the enemy is within and it's in all of us. I want to greatest thing we could do. Have the liberty, find the freedom, the freedom, the freedom. It's realized that our own hands are not taking it all. I think the most courageous thing we could do is not stay. At all, not straight. No eye for an eye. No. Seatate, you take this word, but you take it by love. You get there, I think, by looking at certain devotees. Even the one we don't . I remember meeting in blackout speaks or made in great planes by any pressure that crazy horse in this kill was trying to get back to power grip from the northwest side of the axis.
