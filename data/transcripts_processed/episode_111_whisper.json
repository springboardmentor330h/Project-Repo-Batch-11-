Until the age of 70, he moved that in the woods and everything came back. I moved out in the course of 70 years old, and that just decided that I would try and all trying to style a living. And really with that I did think it all through in a major, complex way. I decided that I would  to try and live now and try and stop moving out. Sorry, gibbon. to keep the other shoes and make my whole school clothes. And I'm going to make just be sure people understand. And when you're looking at the inside, you're there year round. Yeah, totally moved out. Right now, I've lived outside for 20 years now. And the time used to smooth that side, who was interested in the past. And all the things people knew about how to look at nature, back when they had a choice not to be teaching. Rehearsly looked in the woods, sat in the tea, but did some feet fell on her, made his own clothes that deer skin, zoned, tensed, and toys. And then he started to evolve, from a life as a hunter gatherer, to basic agriculture, to plant harvest, cultivated patch land, started raising animals, how to self-hatter work, horses and yields. In other words, he, personally, went through the major evolutionary stages to the human species that 10,000 years were made to set his own up. We're on the same time that he moved out to the... as far as yet another way to write a course professor and I decided to do it when I was sitting around I can't find I heard about how book that was lived with the courses in the national bars and it just sort of struck me  a thunderbolt  my mind and I feel  I didn't even know what was coming out of my mouth I just said I'm the rock horse of the American. And then he asked me if I wanted to go use this stuff but that's the first reaction was a little sad. No, not really, but why? Just seem  a big undertaking and I was happy. My little life. But then I looked and asked myself, what reason do you not have to go? Why shouldn't you go? Why not? And one of my biggest inspirations for Gauron was to spend with him. Some 10 years after he first decided to ride a cross-mared. just to finally set out on the team with the team. Right in this part, in experiment, the current time, what have to try to get up to the good business and the goal. This part of the R branch, mainly courses, battle the elements, testing themselves, much toward a goal they had no idea to create. , but I should tell you that for you, the main idea in the practice trip was not new, so for him to solve that, for you, it's just a big part of it simply without courses. Use this in order for you to work on the courses for a while, and set out on the trail. Now, they need to... just something about living with horses, working with horses, it was going to learn, derailed some awe, sustained, and once. He took Jetson, who worked with horses on the ranch in Wyoming, who was a ryanquad, people trips to the mountains, plus in acquaintance of theirs Susan could task to work for a couple of years in the stable, had horses in her room. There are indoor people in their outdoor people, Susan grew up down the street for just a Jetson, three kids who spent a lot of a year. I grew up in neighborhood where a skid. We all hung out and  to run up down the creek chasing car dads and fish and snakes and turtles But we lived in town A new grand defect most people are indoors people are most people are outdoors Most people are indoors people but I think they want to be outdoor But they don't have to get outside and enjoy Thanks for watching Are you gonna play next week?

So friends, happy Bandho​ track Episode 125 Acto Denshnev Private Z your best friend renounces everything with two of you share everything about your lives, go live a simpler life in the mountains, once, stay with us. I come on, long riders. So when they set out, it was used to stretch an ensuesin, forehosts, camping gear, and a truck. And it was kind of a crazy scheme to it, with it they worked every day they would wake up. And one of them would try to start. Who need to... You can do it. Just go on. It´s true. It´s true. That does go on. Think it will be useful for a meeting. Yeah, maybe I will go some the city miles that the river was in the campgrounds. And then the person that could hitchhike back the same corner to the miles, which could take hours. And then, after all that, they would set out on the horses and ride on that. A couple months into the trip they had to walk, we are going to drive to some head and then we just came to the side of that. The other sort of crazy 20th century adaptation to the 19th century horse ride, is it they did not ride through open country. So, we talk on the MARČ愇, show this pipe. side's boats. It seemed  the most fish fruit that you recorded yourselves as you got accustomed to your mountain, to seven-sheen, about 30 hours of tea. Studying with that first day, to ask you what it was  sitting out. Oh, it was easy, you said it again. It was sort of , okay, the day has come, we're going. , I knew that we didn't know what we were doing. That was okay. I was wrong. That was fine with that. I personally knew that those big tent that we wouldn't make. Apart from the look. get younger and it done less trouble. So a little bit more obvious. And so they work on how you're going to do this thing. Thank you. That's selling the background is the D-for-ostor. This is a used-it's kind of way out of 25th of December. Yeah, I said it myself. Oh, you hear that little y'all. Let me go that little again. Yeah! That's dancing, Kyle. I use the crazy. And then between us is the lovely lady. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Come on, kids. Jesus, I'm glad he's in and that first day I said you're so young and happy. We were trying along, trying along, cutting along, beautiful pink, trying out the bell right here and make the blue back down the time to darken black in the bottom. It's hard to cut when you have to wait to twist the ground looking at the beauty of it. Well, today I feel for it alive. It fully awake. It's sake of this manner of living passion and dream. Here's that pillied woodpecker with the background. Here a car coming up behind me. Just a little bit closer with the afterbreed. So we knew almost nothing about it. We didn't know what we were doing. Even finding Luke, how are we going to go to a car? Did you have a bigger Atlas or something? We had a few state roadmath. A few state roadmath. Well, everybody kept saying, well, what's your route? How are you going to go to a car? I don't really know we're getting wet every day. I actually shouldn't be the worst. So we have the third day. It's about lying that's seeing here. We're just looking for a real. We could have a fine time and we're just taking the day and trying to turn. We're going to have to see the twister too. Well it's not a clock, we're riding home. bad чего for years time He just shut up, got the broom, drop the broom, knock the flare bell. off. This is the later they even see what he thinks but it's in my keepser. Or just what he thinks about there a month. They've referred to it as Goddess. Oh no, he's kind of strange to my keepser. Not a hat of the backguard. His or the light of the shot creeps. And then lead to it. Run. Just get lead. Go. Go. Okay. We're getting our first train right now, the first train in the old tips. Drizzleing not much rain but enough to lower our streets enough to worry. Hey, hey, no. Now, my spirit's off. Are you out of here, wild? Oh, you're a wild, wild. We should stop raining until we get the kids. And despite how you are, I'll have to go to the park. We're basically wearing a lot of Westerns. and stop clothes which wasn't for stoppers, all this old cowboy clothes action work. They do the things that you need. Silk Skars, cowboy hat. Shaps and spurs and the whole bit had guns, knives, long hair and look, brush and tail and all time for it. Interesting, Jack. Well, here's a good, good, good, good toy. And riding through the slow town when down main street. And some more asses, some more to a plate glass wind, look at it. There's a lot of balls, a round drop, those things. What's the one on? So, see the man scrap something from his desk, run out of the wind, run out of the window. So, some, I look back, everyone. So, I'm a guy, I'm walking behind him, so, have running behind him. Probably we get the edge down at the distance, rain, a bit rainy. So, hey, this one. I didn't want to interrupt you. I thought you might be making movies, but you're stuck. You can't sit so real. You really look real. I was , you're not really a real person. You said this over and over. You were studying. You said this over and over. You really look real. I'm now. I'll go ahead and take a... It's not just a far off or around, it's celebrate making these crowds of holes. They didn't stop these dogs, it was just here and I was never doing that. Wow! How old am I? Let me see, tuck us in. Where would I be? What up? Here, that's the best amazing part. Starder, people would really appreciate taking place that never imagined that the past and the objects rose from here and knives and yet the most conservative set that sent from farmers and bring us right into their homes. And their children, the last and the streets are not your part of it. The entire America. was great. There were most gracious and accepted us and we go to the one town and they'd say you're a watch out for this next town and going through because they're kind of questionable people and we get that town and they'd be just as nice as last time. Everybody was great. Long story out now, how much do you want to take but let's just say one morning I'm at these two guys I was ain't gonna stand on the side of the road. I'm standing on the side of the road. Standing on the money, trying to get a ride. They pull up. or sends more on the way to church. Yeah. So this is a portable car full of the charming bag wheel. It comes to stop right there at the quick stop, cross road. One of them does not get some time. I have better time. I'm out there on the top of the smile. I'm going to hold my money up. OK. J was in the job season. Did a drive start? If I can lead that car to the initial stagehен whose Friendship. Enjoy this car and emoculation. You have a career mate. Yes. I'm sorry. I'll remove it. Hey, you got any money? I'm sorry, I'm not. I have a very strong gun. I say you got any money! Yeah, I think I better go negotiate with this man before I mark the whole thing. I'm so sorry, I give five dollars. This is the other side of the town actually. I got a lot of half way all this, so I'm not getting all that stuff. So we're sitting there to go see it back and forth. but how wrong sounds walking out these two guys? But how wrong sounds walking out these two guys? How wrong sounds walking out these two guys? We just looked at one round. That round. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently those sounds are cranked up. They start from one loss. How wrong sounds go out of a weird, weird, weird, weird. That's open to trees. Now you can see the mess coming out. You just looked at me and we nailed it and he just got to take it. I'll say it's , , , wrap it  get ready to drink beer. And then they just about the time it's turning back and they look to make the all set  you remember man. , you want to be? You want to be? You can buy a spare, okay? So it gives me beer and he cracked another one. You can tell me, you should have , I love this. He said, we are everywhere. He said, he said, he's taking his big money drink. He's , what have you got? And we're here. He said, they're tossing that. The day I'll hang through the trust. And he's telling about his life. He said, he's telling about him. He said, we're all right. And I'm telling about the horses. Here we got horses waiting over there. He's , listen at this time I had no idea. But he thought, I was fool. I thought I was  tripping on F. And I had no idea that anything I was saying maybe anything. So we're having this conversation. I think he's of believing everything. So I'm telling him about my life story. He's telling me you  you said you're telling me you  woods at a high level. You  that. That's a teenager. I tripped him. He's 6. Yeah, right. You got it. Okay, yeah. So we got the gas station. I feel so about the gas. We drive off. And so we come around the BN.

There. They got worse! They got worse! They got worse! Absolutely amazing. He's , very sick car in the park and jump fast. This is the normal out there. And he's , man's over to the horse. He's out of touch with us as if it may be real. All of a sudden, everything you hear, instead of them of a freak, all of a sudden he's got respect for me. The reality comes in and he wants to help out. Instead of trying to take my money, they'll be fine. Here Tom at this guy you got to do mine and he's tired of hard of taking the tape you see and he's not there, it's all of it all of it's time,  hard from the steel it's something totally shift and he cares about him so he comes out and leaps on the road several times brings a friend they drop trucking here a couple of days and he's stuck his shift Oh, he's stuck one, I don't When they write it down, they try to find some dense, daily knowledge, they ask the things. In over and over, you can learn what you ask, they invited the net for hot me as hot showers, not from that anywhere to it. This is one family in Louisiana, carbs, who after putting up use this, just speak. Nothing to find in course. It's all for me. Thanks for watching! out on the boat. We're dropping right now the road several hundred miles where they live and I was sitting they drive by hooting all out of the wind. Oh guys is that the marble and they pulled over ahead of us? By the time we got up to them they had a big old thanksgiving dinners with our college even though it was January or February. And they had driven, they driven hundreds of miles. Yeah, then they had no idea exactly what they was just in a hope that we are.... all the cooking, all the driving, all the planning to have that Sunday afternoon to come try to find us and they be here. So why do you think people are responding? To the screen. Because we were doing something, doing something, everybody dreams about but nobody takes the rest of the day. It's the body, the challenge. It's the... This is how I'm thinking about it. I want to tell you. You can do whatever you want. Celebrate line. Don't just work, it's grand forever. Stop! Say, I want to do this. But that's what I'm doing. I want to write a worse growth country. And a thousand people tell me I quit. I didn't listen to one of them. I said, I'm going to do this. And I got on the horse. Started out. I didn't have... I didn't know much about that. I got a horse. I was , it's 3 a.m. or just  out there sort of just  being your heart's out there, right? Just  doing this thing. And so that just  causes that forward while the people in their lives do it. Yeah. People, people would even just ride up, roll down the window and take them to the 10-dollar bill. Several times we have turned people down, we're , let me help. We can stay at our house. We're , well, ready to get playing, it's my yard, he put everything in the house. And we, several times we split up and we'll just think that what else does the screen work? Nerd eleven places,ımızı meer Part of this reaction at the courses, just just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, and it both makes it hard to cross the path. And they said they can pull that nose. And the courses, they're riding to town, , to help. It's hard to make it dusty. I think it's not sad, baby. that's dream. You'll have. When these epic figures try to be interested in your town, happy nuts, we're not going to be smart, but people just give you a bunch. People want to talk, want their speed, which is for adults. I also tell our diary, but, we're, we're, and rock top out, little of nowhere in fact, with three miles. Mark says we just kind of poke them all down here.

First of it, I'll just try to see if he was diagnosed as cancer and also as a health problem, he's living in hospital bed on an oxygen tank, told me why could he be treating himself that morning? She said, we've wanted to be doing that in that house. Man, he knew he was serious, threw that rock up, that shot. Great best to see it! You didn't want to be successful, you wanted to be dead.

The boy. And look. He went to the kid about the one time. And they tell me, I got to the first room here. Yeah. The next time he heard that room, and I know the second thing is of child abuse. So first time he went to the kid. And he would get out to the kid, come on. Okay, something. What do you think please? You are on a seven pound of view of me! What's that? Sit down the morning here. Just got up. Stars are bright. Your check-in board is here and give them there. See? Drinks, passers. eureka That's just... yeah now. What is it? What is it? It's hard to imagine that really thinking about it. I can't look good. even abuse team of riders could capture what I think is best about this movement or the reality but the down process of the challenge freshness the warmth of simplicity the support of the people  the ones in that kind of way that's just right by just that I had her today, but they moving as a fruit across the back.

Because what it's all about was the difficulty of being on the road, which is not so good. Now I know we started  meeting the miles, meeting the town, just then being up at two in the morning, taking equipment, getting out before day while having some Morning till the sunlight was sleeping for hours, and we didn't go to bed refresh, we had the bed worn out. We'd get up for hours later and we're feeding the grass in the morning.

Almost the bearers, but in fact, we just bought a horse. This one had in the handle of a very long time, had a reputation. He had a little bit more as well. So I'm riding along. We get to the air zone a lot. Every time we get to a line, one of us usually judge my brother shoots off the gun, just a celebration. Racking, we made it clear not to say, so. We go through the gate, and I shut the gate where they are, so I don't tell them to celebrate. And, intuitively, I need not to get up on this horse, but my brother for some reason, I don't know why he said get up on horse, for some reason, that politicians should get up on horse. I'm really bored. Stainless, get ready for a big bite. My God, get this ass out of us. We are. while using the Soul of mr. Gate to fall and go toего Lets start the Playgrad I used the gunshot.

I had nothing much to break. I did it back in my head. I mean, I climb back up, but still run down. The blood needed my hair back there, but no mom. Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna drop blood. I was back again. She's done with today! Do you think this one is good? N-no. I know my brother and Susan were kind of  normal people even for my lifestyle since forever very So I'm not really different About a month ago I read a horse and the tree chasing another horse and it got dark I did not want to give up on catching the horse first time I'd ever let the horse today So I'll read an Android tree not clear Roll is it under one or whatever Powerhouse is eroded. It's softer. You're right. So we're down here. I don't have this. This year, we're here to hold the game. On the gate, we're here to hold the game. So, that's the good monster, that's the good. You can see that's what your story of my life means, what I'm trying to teach people for living, that you can do to teach yourself and you can take that. We used to go pull out over one wheel.

I can smell it and feel it and feel it and the traffic is the line this is Exciting room. We are covered. We're the colors here. We finally saw. It was weird to see it. Now, I thought those gonna be a lot more crazy energy was more self-inflicted than your sport to sit on your horse. And stare at the ocean, smile, smile, just, we did it. In the hot days of Arizona, somehow, it was just more man-thunking for that ocean. I'm gonna get off and just go running, diving the water, and swim out as far as I can. And all that crazy excitement, , I didn't have it. It's more just a silent stare. We just stood there, stood there looking at it, unbelievable that we had gotten there, looking around, this really sand under our feet, or those really waves there. It was , , if you could just scream, wow, let it echo for a couple of hours. Wow, wow, wow. Twist begin.

What's your job there? What are you doing? I'm an older selector at a local warehouse here, associated with all so grossers. And what's your life to grow, Charlie? I don't have to do that. It's pretty crazy. We work hard every day. It's a pretty labor intensive job. And it's interesting to look at the perspectives of my fellow employees. And how this is their life, and this is what they do. And I kind of see past it and I've seen what I've done. And there's so much more out there. Do you find you keep talking better about the level of my skin? A little bit, not a whole lot. I'm living in town. In Oklahoma, don't know a whole lot of people, and if I tell them that I've wrote my horse cross country, I don't think they believe me. But I would flick back on it, quite a bit. Have you told people a word? I feel. And so what did they say? They don't believe me. Lord, I've never lived for a church's world. I love creation better as it stood. That day you finished it some long ago. And looked upon you were, called it good. I know that others find you in the light. that sifted down through tinted window paints. And yet I seem to feel you near the night. And this dim quiet scarlight on the moon. I think you lored that I'm blaze so well, that you've made my freedom so complete. That I'm no slave to whistle, soccer bell. Now we got prison to Wall of Street. Just let me live my life as I began and give me work that's open to this guy. Make me a partner of the Wind and Sun. And I will ask the life that's softer than I do. Let me be easy on the man that's down. Let me be square in generously. Well, I'm careless sometimes Lord, on I'm in town. You'd never let them say I'm mean, small. Make me as big and open as the planes. An honest, as a horse between my knees. The Ena's from the Hector Xen Schmatt. Something I was written back in people about the places, because he must have had an choice. A little with the night's. century, the queer century before the invention of the clayball, must people looking in the farm, small towns. In the United America was already so big and changing so fast and so unprecedented and alarming that already people were worried that modernity and all the team were there is making it hard to think properly, feel properly, it's really good. Here's the reading. I went to the woods because I wish to live to the glibbering, it's front only the essential faccipline, see if I could not learn what I had to teach. And not when it came to die, discovery that I had not been. I did not wish to give but was not , I wanted to withdraw life into a corner, reduce it to its lowest terms, and prove to be mean, whether to get to the whole and genuine meanness of it. I published it in this world, through this sublime, to know what I experienced, I'd be able to give it to you at counterme. This is on hear through the row, which is one of the stations in this world. It is a clean line of heritage in this, to devalenteurites, this is the movement that so many other movements today, which seek to shed all the stuff. Codders are lives, those are heads. Here's a throw in the thing. The nation is cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and fetus expense. It lives too fast. Men think that it's essential that the nation have commerce and export ice, to talk to your telegraph and ride 30 miles an hour. Whether we should look ... that boons are  man, as long as certain. Here's a make-up passage to throughout, especially appropriate for this week. Friendly, really. It's a much cheaper obsessed with news, but I love about it is the simultaneously provocative and completely reasonable and at the same time from my perspective almost totally nuts. See, right? I am sure that I have never read any memorable... news in a news group. If we read of one man Rob, I'm murdered, killed by accident, but one house burned, one vessel wrecked, one steamboat blown up, but one cow ran over on the Western Railroad, a one mad dog killed, one lot of grasshoppers in the winter. We never need read of another. One is enough. If you're acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher, all newsists called Scossip, may he edit read it? old women over their tea. Yeah? Not a few were greedy after the scossive. News which I seriously think already went right at 12 months or 12 years before him. News subscription actor, as your Spain friends,  how to throw in dumb Carlos and the imponta, dumb Pedro and Sevilla and we're not at the time in the right proportions. They have changed the name of the little since I saw the papers. It will be true to the letter. And give us a good idea of the exact state or the rule of things in Spain. It's the most sick thing. and the new seed reports under this head in the newspapers. And as Wrangler, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649. Well, we move on. One of the difficulties with simplifying your lives is that people are competent. So simplifying your life often means cutting yourself off from people, which can be complicated in an habitat, won't take human chances. A couple of years ago, that's front-rare left-to-life incentives, to study Zen and monitor advanced neurosurgery. We made his decision so unsettling, so let it used to be neat. We lived in the same flat, at the same place. We were both writers, we lived for the same months. For me, the life was a blessing. Larry said it was a torture site, and for the death of his wife. Larry has now been ordained as a monk. He's even taking a news out of me. talking. It's been two years but I still don't follow him to stay and I'll check to my left. Boy, it picks me up at the airport while I'm here and run for the sensei. Usually we have to do. We have to go to Hongdi Po and buy a lot of things and I'm not sure about so we have to figure a lot of things out. Then we have to find the strike in our space that I think is on. essentially quantumness. What? It's a dream of bowing man that some restores waxing. And then we have to go to the new life very weeks at the 250 or to make two rest amongst students in three units bound to the meditation meetings with Japanese and master to go off to move. Then he's in charge of constructing the toilet that we've promised. Then more chanting the evening, daily schedule ends not night. Not. I have to admit that I take a bit of perverse pleasure in fact even though Larry is ejected the second life he's still also now he's deep in trouble with which good sense. 30 mess. What would you do if you just stepped up in the floor of sand? I mean water well. Driving around the suburbs, feeling  it's a quiet, it's  a little time. We got some good job, mutual friends, talk about this. If that evening of the monitor. and get to get the moment of the sprek, things get a little more tense. We have the same conversation with how to dust the time. I still wanted to explain this wrongness of life, the share. Here's what he says. Never being content, restless, never being there, and really being present, and everything to do with the self-defense. Fluids, wet and glass, and back. It's... Did you see that about other people in terms of school? So you? No, no, no. So what's the instrument we do with it? , it's the same. But it also seems balanced out, this should be my good choice for resistance. I don't see it as a... I think it's the same sort of distortion. I never buy a used instrument, it's the same from the system. And right here, because I saw this distortion, , it would be so as me to try it, Vince you missed. I don't really want to do that. , all these masters of various traditions say is of course you're blind and you're living in a dream. You don't know, you don't realize you're suffering. You're really. But then I go out and dragging people out of their houses and say, oh, actually you're suffering. Never I do some sort of stuff. It's , found this path. I've heard this in this social. And you're dressed suffering. That was a little too much. Oh, I won't be wrong. My business is burnt. He's studying the end. Short breaks between the chores and the patient. I'm cutting into his five hours to three. I follow as a ghost to hit the sticks. I'm on the piece of wood. Six pieces of wood. And I'm forced to. after I spin the button, learn i  it neck bone What's that? Right down there. It's the sea of the L.A. Sprog. It's the ocean. It's the downtown. One more list. It's the first one. It's the second question. What do you listen? ���sten. Can I message? I need a message from the brand. Let's take it. Before. So to leave your fantasies. Couldn't we do? One, two, three. Let's make it all. To make a positive interesting situation, choose the boring that they didn't face as any pain here for the spring weeks. So, let's see if we can keep back here. I think Charlie is a person, which I remember that. Let's do it. It's hard to call it. It's a hair done with the needle. It's a blind numbing. It seems to be as bad as my knees. I'm going to do that in this room. And then we'll be somewhere from here. But I said, Me? It's kind of embarrassing to be back. So, Oh, man. I'm feeling wrong with you. I've never slept with my last day. And then, time. Seems unfolded. And then we're so close. I'm sorry. I'm trying to use... and I was trying to see... felt ... to use it, I had to travel around the world and see... and see things, I felt ... I was traveling around the world and I were in war and... and here I was in the opportunity to get out of the earth and live in a simple place in the mountains. Let's do this. Here I am. änge let's do the experience and the experience and the work która thousand years chances to meet And discovered in all this, why we are so virtual. Why you are tortured? So, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I'm tortured as well. I don't know the belief in seeing you, you... Many times I see you as tortured torture. You're posture in your eyes. You're  an ass, a sin, a sin. Feast you're teaching some questions if I were... These are these things about it, and want to see this. State of writing. You rise me. I start. I mean, the distraction of you, ? I mean, the question is what? What are we talking about? I'm asking to go with you, girlfriend. I mean, that can be a question that I could have asked for any time for the last five years. And then, see, you do the dance of writing. You're writing now. I asked you this question you're writing now. I give it a... You're not riding through the question entirely, you're not getting the tendency to be deep, spares upon. So, to problem with this discussion, it's that we disagree in all the premises. Larry doesn't see any value whatsoever, the life of a steady, he thinks I'm barely experienced. I have the same doubts about his life. He says he's never fought more alive, but I see his mood to the simple life of the monster, and stuff will be with you. The easier to be marked, except in his choice, he can be marked, except in mind when he feels. In fact, his Larry tried to see can find clarifons all but can be. But his life refused to see him from me. Shortly after he arrived in the bulk of the meta-charmings on his team. Love affairs have discouraged him, so for over a year, Larry and coffin can imagine what it's  to speak. Well, I'm not ready to say that he couldn't fulfill his mom to do studies and he didn't have any chance to get back to him. She left. Larry's now decided that in a few months after the toilet business pushed me to the father. I feel vindicate as we. I'm not wrong. Is it possible to do the commercial? Feel  a step back. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know, maybe it feels  I've parted with my life that I... I mean, it's gonna sound poppish to say I moved beyond it, but I... It's just... it's a fused with things that I don't really want to pursue. So Larry and Captain are going looking for another Zen community, please stop. Before I leave, I asked where I did place in the songs. Again, it's an experience where we disagree every once. And this is the time to friends again, it's a crime to stop  the songs. There is these different, he calls them catalogs to the church. But I make him sing a few things. I want to get them out to the messages from the old there. Me!
