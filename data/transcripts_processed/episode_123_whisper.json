And I remember it was a sunny day, it was, , inspiring it, everything. It was  outside and sitting there with Jamie and Dr. Blake sitting there telling me I have good news for you. And the second song is gonna use that didn't have HIV, didn't have AIDS. And I just sat there  this can't be. , my, I've been told this, my whole life's been planned about this. , I'm saying- Did you just assume that he was wrong? Did you immediately believe that?

You don't have this. And that is precisely what happened to Shirley, after living this attack in hospital for years. It turned out the back when she first got tested very gently, the woman at the county health department deliberately lied to her, told Shirley and she was attacking the hospital. And in fact, the test was negative. She was helping the child. and you've come to the little newspaper church in town to be real. Of those questions, experience. Then of course, should be a doctorate, very valuable medical producers. I just wrote down, and just cried, cried, cried. And just couldn't believe it. That hadn't been betrayed.

Looking back on it all from the nice cozy room in her house, we can have it.

I mean, just those things might seem just so insignificant with something much bigger than that. That was happening. , the work that it took to get to the edge, , and to have gotten to really to the end essentially to get that far and then to be. people back, there was one part of me that way, there's some simplicity here, there's some peacefulness here, there's no more insanity of the world and people's politics and people's, , pushing this and their beliefs. And I'm working hard to keep. My life's simple today, but then I wanted to keep it as simple as it was, and that preparation for night, and you can't do that, and live in the real world at the same time. The first thing I'll do today will actually work otherwise, the second chance to do it via the wall. Nine daysacional! Regarding theICKER Have a nice day of memorial and the next day of fantastical Shelley atheists are the most beautiful theaters ever. It's just okay. I have to come to you. I'm so sure. So I find. Coming up, the social uses of baby top. That's baby top coming on adults. Grace yourself, this is just one minute away. But public radio international, when our program. This American life of my reclass, each we can approve of course which is the priority frieders what is the number of those programs? These are stories. And I'm actually, I'm probably saying this because when you say it out loud, it sounds sort of depressing. These are stories about people who choose not to live at numbers, who choose to withdraw from life and so on. To make themselves not. It's a story about why that sometimes we only choose possible. We've arrived at a two-of-our program, how to avoid the COVID-19 summer. if she gives up to her mother, her parent, and she remembers staying together. So we Internet works with Ombe. She also ment something. I would argue that baby top, cute speech, is one way to be. People seldom discuss this in public. Around producing an empty updite and for boyfriend, I thought it didn't last half of it. And you're too skeptical where it lets people go. You want to short-cut to the intimacy that you used to come from Just spending hours, hours talking to one another about our lives. Because when you're first falling, That's the only thing that you do. You want it to be, there's just a few baking as much times possible for just talking to each other and ask the relationship, presses other things to research themselves, work, work, and press, whatever it is. Then you have less time together and we want to get that, but you want to get that intimacy, and you don't have much time, so you're... and trying to split it. Make a shortcut to it. It happens so fast. An element answers, guys, that me going out on three months, then, of twins, people in captivity, that zirited tribes on remote desert islands, that began to develop in wrong climate change. It's another way they found that they were whispered to each other. Well, I feel  that came about. , I'll pull out on the phone, , and out of words to phone. So, , so we called me later. Day and I call him too. And then, , say, , hi, how you doing? And then, I'll say, , I get to go and I'll say, not a couple, not a couple. No, don't call. I have to call. You're at the quee for the whistling. This whistling, this also  gives me a couple. Watch your go, don't call. Ask your go, don't call. So you're doing that and then that starts on the phone and you find that it's just creep others. I mean I think the baby talk, you want it to be called the impact one word. , , or I have that one going to sleep because that's when you go. And then that big talk. It's , oh, this is, this is, this is a, this is a class. Yeah, you just, you just, you hear, I don't have it. But in a very sort of, , kid way to hit, no, not , puns them off. I could vote at the end of the day and Charlie's music We dinner Watch it to be a crime And And that also kind of just reach out Hit me a little bit, he'd be , I  you So thank you, but do And , first great And , and of course now I hit back I And that's another hope So always over yeah okay yeah I don't think you, , if, , I'd be operating with thermostat. , doing, it's an answer to , could you turn it down and say, and I'd say, , no, it's too cold. She'd be , no, it's the other cold. It's too hot. And that's  a whole shark. He's going to be in turn it up. Only meant the other up. Yeah. This is... this is definitely the most embarrassed thing that I've ever had to pretend to have. Without any question, I'm not. I mean, what's amazing is that you've talked about, , you talked about sex and public use, but money and public, but this, why this? Because it's completely uncool. There's nothing, there's nothing cool about it. There's no way to make it cool. Now, you can be outrageous about sex, or you can, , you can make fun. of either having a lot of men, you're having a little much. There are ways that you can talk about those things that you could preserve some corner of dignity. But baby talk is completely without any cool or dignity or any sort of redeeming social value. I mean, it's just this, , it is truly a dirty little secret. Much more. sex. , it happens and it happens. This protected all space. Right. They might cry this. Right. Right. Exactly. And, , it's strange because it is this very, it's this very performative speech. It's  Kabuk, , you sort of do this in a way every time. Now, everyone knows the next move. But it's, it's this performing. for one person. And then there was this thing where one of us was nicknames. My god, and not. Nancy would always know which one. And I would always treat this. Okay, okay, we're going to do this. One of you had a nickname and there was a nickname. Wait, wait, wait. One was, one was snucky. And then the other one of course it's shlumpy. It's shlumpy. So logically the other one must be shlumpy. I'm  the tears of the bears. I'll scream for you. But then that becomes a whole thing. I don't know if we're in a situation. I remember that we were at the same time. I remember that we were at the same time. We are lying in bed together and we are going back and forth. We are just talking about the part where I'm sleeping. We are going back and forth in one of the ways that we have the time now. I think I'm not sure. I don't know. I want that blanket. Oh, that blanket is another blanket. The one blanket. No. Who knows something? No. He was all shnooky, whatever it was. And I just, I thought  I was going to cry. I just felt so full of despair. And I said, can we stop talking this way? And then what did you say? Well, I remember feeling  it had been a couple of weeks. Did you miss that hat a lot? tough times and work and didn't have a lot of time together. So we're so busy. And I remember it had been days of just me feeling , I don't even know her. She doesn't, and when you're that close, I'm just really kind of moving. And I just, I had wanted to say something. I was leaving talk for so long, but there's why I couldn't think of the same. I didn't think outside of the air. And second of all, I thought it would really hurt her. And so when she said it, it was just water with me. And I remember beginning to talk  you're right, we should talk in a serious way. And that all, , and it was  finding a moon out, finding a new tongue, and moving all the stress in my head, that felt, , the way more powerful than the data, please. It's an art of visual, it's a little bit. , when you're in a couple of, actually in a couple, and then you're pretending to be a couple, see, oh, shh. Yeah, really. Yeah, we've touched it. Yeah, what's it, what do you say? I think it's really nice to have some fun. Yeah, sure. I mean, pretending, tending does have its attention sometimes. Pretending does let your voice things for a couple of days, sometimes what you need, and it's okay. I think, , fake intimacy that seems real is much easier, and it's much more seamless. Because there's nothing to disrupt the flow of it. There's no you never get angry and you never hate each other and you never just annoyed and you never bored and you never anything that would that would interrupt that that read out of of intimacy Nothing  that ever happens And then yeah now it's easy easier to protect to be happy couple of men to be happy couple. It's easier to be saved. Yeah. Did you feel on the you for the you're actually in danger that they just knew it before the rules? Yes, definitely. And what is the thing for this? The actual substance of the relationship. And that sounds to call, but I've got  a goose. this person that I fell in love with and that I am in love with. When I'm in that kind of baby talk, pretend, intimacy, it's impossible to imagine real consciousness, real connection, oh just a real conversation. Even in my mind, I think of it in, through that baby talk, , just remembering real conversation is a baby talk, such. And I want you to get really stiff. I want you to get really stiff. Well I remember when this happened, the first time I've had a question out, it happened It happened twice a week that you actually have to say, oh wait now I will be in a doctor. Yeah, they hit their pen pretty early. Yeah, but it's so interesting. You mean that the pool of the suit is really nice. Yeah, yeah. No, it's chronic condition. Definitely, it's  T.B. Once you test pause, you have to sort of watch for it. Because one thing, it's just  a warm bath. It's , it's the easiest thing to do. So it's just  falling down, hitting the ground. the ground. Routine that the two of you have been doing together for 30 years. He says his line, you sing your line, the audience laughs. everything happens the way it's supposed to. Stop dreaming out of theеня jail You can see up high. and how to do it. It's possible to turn off your emotions and go on autopilot for a brief period with the person you love. And it's also possible to shut your feelings down completely as Ms. Min-Win, from Redu-Deng. Here in no particular order are some things runny toady that he and his wife didn't sleep in the same bed that they hadn't had a real marriage in years. That she was undergoing a lecture shock treatment in the clinic outside Philadelphia. That he had cancer and had to fly to Houston three days a week for chemotherapy. That his youngest daughter, H3, had a rare form of childhood leukemia. That he could not get a divorce for all of the above reasons. That he was heartbroken that he could not leave his wife and marry me. For a long time I believed him. He was every bone in my body I trusted when he climbed was telling me the truth. I'm going to talk to you about it. his jaw would tighten and his big brown eyes would fill with tears. His voice would play her with pent-up complex feelings that I couldn't possibly begin to understand. Poor Lenny, I marveled that so many bad things could happen to one person, and I vow to take care of him. Writing late at night in my extensive journals, I exhorted myself to be a real woman, one of its step-up to the plate, and be good to her now in his moment Gracias. Years later, I hold Lenny's lies up to the light and examine my own reasons for believing what in retrospect seems to be a preposterous. I reread my old journals and noticed the way my girlish handwriting deteriorated into a squall as I wrote. I have to be there for Lenny. He needs me. He's going through so much. I don't know if I intend to work but I have to be strong. I tried to remember that Lenny was a trial lawyer, that he built an international reputation based on his own pathology, that he lied was almost evangelical conviction. He cried of himself on being able to convince anyone of anything. Paris, 1985. We are walking along the boulevard's... and her man on a cloudless spring day. The rooftops of a left bank are creamy against a rare blue sky, and the air outside peffey floor smells of croissants and the Acrid Smokers ye'etem, but I don't notice. In Paris in 1985 I only see what is within one square foot of me, too busy feeling the complicated stew of sensations being with Lenny provokes. I am hung over, floating on a wave of last night's alimentated forced our dinner that wound up in a toilet in the hotel rooms. Lenny's arms around me, they can comply to. I have not read a newspaper or spoken to a soul other than Lenny for weeks now. I've been living the kind of unbelievable life people lied through airport novels. We have been to London, Montcarlo, the co-to-zuer. I have played Blackjack and private clubs with oil sheets who ask me to blow on their dice I wear dark glasses and hope to tour suits. A gold watch and a long fixed rune of pearls. I have no idea who I am. Many seers us onto a narrow side street, off the boulevard Sangha Man, and into which children's clothing store filled with embroidered dresses, my mother used to buy me as a child. He tells me he wants to buy a dress for his young new daughter, who won with the rare form of leukemia . I help him look through racks of tiny. dresses suitable for a three-year-old, which will be fine one-heathens perfect, a pale yellow silk smock with a Peter Pan collar. He holds it up to the sunlight and his eyes filled with tears. She'll never live to outgrow distress from hispers, my baby girl. He has layered his eyes one on top of the other until they have become opaque and a labric construction resembling reality. He is fond of coding probably the only line he knows from advances in this folk jed over. White is black, and black is white, he often says with the sign. I never knew exactly what he meant by this, but it seemed to have a lot to do with my life at the time. The lies had small beginnings. Rene called me for a business trip, which told me he was at Montreal Airport, waiting to catch a flight to Calgary. I checked with the airline and found out that the flight would take approximately five hours. So when many call an hour later to say... he had landed in Calgary, a very commonly asked him where he really was. How graced? No, many, we were. He stuck to his story. In the time that I knew him he never ever changed his story in midstream. I hung up on him and called his family's house in Westchester. When the maid answered the phone I asked to speak with Mr. Cahn. And when he picked up the extension, and I heard his rough, cradied, hello, I screamed so hard into his ear that he dropped them. receiver. He raised into the city. He led himself into my apartment and family caught up in bed. His group neop and held me to his chest. His wife wasn't homey talking. She was having a shock treat. And someone had to take care of his daughter. He hadn't wanted to tell me because he wanted to spare me to protect me from the horror of his life. Surely I understood. Sure, she started. He murmured into the top of my head as I wept. My face beat. little girls, so many people need me, he said, but I love you best of all. Two years of past and something has gone wrong, terribly wrong with my life. I don't in fact think of my life as my life, but rather as a series of random events that have no logical connection. I no longer a student. I dropped out of Sarah Lawrence after my junior year, supposedly to pursue acting, and I'm actually doing a pretty good imitation of actors. But I'm doing even better imitation of a mistress. Lenny's been busy buying me things. I don't particularly want these things, but they seem to be what Lenny is offering and lieu of himself. So quite suddenly, overnight, really, I find myself driving a black Mercedes convertible. In just in case I might be mistaken for anything other than a kept woman, I wear a mic. coat, the cardiac watch, a Bulgarian necklace, ancient coin at its center. The Mercedes is a step down from the first carl to give me when we have been going out for a month, at least for Rari. I don't know how to drive a stick ship to the Ferrari was a bit of a problem. What I must have looked , a 20-year-old blonde dressed  Ivana Trump, struggled in traffic, grinding gears, trying to find a point on the clutch to hold that ridiculous car in place. He rented an apartment on a pretty little street in Greenwich Village, a furnished trip Lex with a garden, a fireplace, and a bedroom with a foreposter bed. He called it our house, as if he didn't have another home with a whole family in it, an hour north of the city. He kept half a dozen suits in the bedroom closet, and a brand new silk robe hung behind the bathroom door. There was an entire floor we didn't use, a large airy children's nursery. My parents knew that something was up. They knew I was going out with somebody but they had no idea who. I was drifting away from them and they were letting me go. One night I invited them over for dinner. I pushed all traces of Lenny out of sight, but of course they were clues. A glossy brochure of Italian yachts, a humid door in the center of the coffee table. a man's burberry overcoat on a hook near the front door. I cooked up a storm and the place was filled with homie smells, garlic, basil, coriander. It was winter and the snow was piled up on the hills. Spotlights in the backyard shown on the landscape garden, redwood table, add-alonged act chairs, and a huge terracotta pots of rastreams dead geraniums. I had my father's favorite music, towards acts symphony for the new world playing. mysterious system. My parents ran into a doorbell. They looked so solid standing on my foot's stoop. Their cold red noses poking out from above their mufflers. If nothing else they looked  they belonged together. They were elegant and rangy, similarly proportion. Unlike Renie and me, Renie is thick as a lineback and I had become so... delegate when could have picked me up and blown me away. My mother screwed into the brownstone as if it wasn't the weirdest thing in the world to be visiting her daughter in a lavish apartment with no name on the outside buzzer. My father trailed behind her wearoutly as if setting foot on another planet. My mother entered the living room, slung her arms wide and didn't impump to dance to dorshak. I'd swallow the law she triilt. My father and I hung back and watched. Our face is crumbled into awkward smiles. We were used to it. In every family there is room for only one Sarah Birdhart, and my mother had assumed that role. It didn't occur to me that she was frightened, that this was a lot for her to take in, for college dropout, daughter, living in a lap of luxury. All I could see was her outsized self, twirling around my living room in her fur coat and boots. I wanted a drink. I walked over to my mother. put a hand on her shoulder and she spun to a halt. I took a coat and my father's and hung them above Lenny's raincoat by the front door. For the first time I noticed there was a wreath made of twigs, a bit of Americana, on the wall near the kitchen, and I wondered if I could remove it quickly before my father sighed. Wreaths under any circumstances are as goyish as it gets. Which would be worse for my father, imagining that I was with some powerful guy old enough to be my father. or the possibility that the guy wasn't Jewish. I wish I could reassure him. Yes, Daddy, he's Jewish. 23 years older than me, a pathological liar, married to a woman who knows nothing of me, and a Jew. What? I poured myself two glasses of shardenate from my parents and a large vodka from myself. I figured that if the vodka was in a water glass, they wouldn't know the difference, especially if he drank it  it was more. By drinking a taken on a new urgency in the past few months, it was no longer a question of desire, but of need. I could not get through an evening  this about the armor of Bruce. I handed them their wine and directed them to the couch. On the coffee table I had put out a plate of cruditais and a bowl of olives. Quite a place my mother said brightly, her gaze darting around the room at the white thrift fireplace with a squat iron tools, the glass wall overlooking the garden, the sowing spur��. My father stared at the fringe of the work, glassy eye. He needed to be as numb as I did to get through this night. Thanks, I murmured, as if she was paying me a compliment. I checked on dinner using the opportunity to go up some wine from the open bottle and fridge. Varka and white wine was a combination I knew worked from. If I stuck with a formula, things shouldn't be too bad in the morning. Especially if I wasn't eating, and I couldn't see myself eating. The music had stopped by the time we all sat at the dining table, but I didn't notice them. If I had I would certainly change the tape, fill the air with something other than the tinny moldy sound of our three-forks-sweetened instant plates. I pushed my chicken from one side of my plate to the other, my stomach clenched and growled and protested. It seemed that my parents and I after 22 years each other's company had run out of things to set. I already knew their views. a political situation in Israel and we couldn't discuss my schoolwork, I was no longer in school. My father pressed a corner of his nap into his lips and murmured something about the food being delicious. My mother agreed. My wonderful daughter, she said she can hurt him. You've turned into such a little homemaker. I looked at my parents across the table, is that what they really thought? How could they just sit there? Some small pieces of me wanted my father to clean up. me over his shoulder and carry me kicking and screaming to the car he'd parked outside. I secretly wished that they would drive me home, deposit me in my childhood bedroom, and feed me chicken soup and salt teams. I wanted to start my life over again, and I didn't know how. In the face of the most tangible proof that many had been lying to me all these years I remained with him. My little girl was dying here seeing whatever. I noticed the discrepancies in the stories, or my children's mother is having a left for shock death. When I couldn't take my own confusion anymore, was lending mine to me, as I go in crazy, I decided to hire a detective to get to the bottom of it. By this time, my parents knew all about me and lending in theory, but it wasn't something that you talk about. When I think back to my younger self right-winged through the New York City Yellow pages and search for private investment, I feel  I'm watching a movie about someone else. Her girl so cruel as she really did it knowing that he desired to hire a detective was all the answers she needed. I chose a detective agency based on nothing more than it's good address in the East 60s, a neighborhood filled with private schools and shrinks. This isn't what you think I told the detective. I'm in a relationship with a married man and I want you to find out if my boyfriend is cheating on me at his wife. At this his eyebrows shot up. Come again. He claims his wife is an eventual hospital, he told him he hasn't been was her in years. And you think he might be Lion, said him best. Did I see the laughter behind his eyes or is my memo is crying at now? Because I simply cannot imagine a middle-aged man listening to an earnest overdress 22-year-old girl telling that she thinks the boyfriend might still be sleeping at his wife. Yes, I said. I got the proof of that man's lies. In tears I called my mother. Oh darling, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? I don't think so. A pause. Do you want me to call his wife? My mother and Mrs. Klein had met each other at a few school functions. If they've struck anyone, it's a remote hospital. Yes, I said, call her. I'll do it right now, my mother said. I sat by the phone and watched the minutes too, by. I pictured Lenny's wife answering the phone, the shirt be hello, and my mother's slow steady explanation of why she was calling. I had set in motion a chain of events which was now unstoppable, more than 20 minutes passed for my mother called me back. Well, I did it, she said. You talked to her? The world's up. on real, hallucinatory. Yes, she called me a liar. She told me she has a happy marriage to a man who travels along, but he's on his way to California, and I said, no, he's on his way to see my daughter. My mother sounded proud of herself immersed in the drama of the moment. How did she see my husband? The mean. When he's white, was she angry? No, my mother said slowly. She just didn't believe me, Danny. I spent the rest of that day in a state of awful excitement, something was going to happen. And when Lenny showed up that evening at the apartment we were still sharing on the West Village, I was ready. He put his baths down and gave me a hug. The phone rang. My mother had given Mrs. Klein the number of the apartment and suggested she find out for herself what her husband was up to. Lenny picked up the phone on the kitchen wall. Hello? I watched him and picked up. the first and only time the years I knew him. He looked genuine with his eyes. He didn't say it were he just listened for a few minutes then hung up in film. That was my wife he said. I was silent. How did she get this number? I shrugged. I have to go. I'd imagine I said thank you. My anger was giving me the fuel that I needed to stay strong at least but what's been for you? When Lenny slammed out of the apartment I was certain I would never see him again. I knew the truth now. It was staring me in the face in the concrete form of flight lists and photos. And he knew that I knew. And besides the whistle was blown, what could he possibly turn his wife? This was it I told myself. I should never put one in. It wasn't him. Many still call 10-12 times a day. He left messages on my answering machine. Hello? His voice filled my bedroom. Fox, are you there? Sometimes he didn't say a word. He would stay on the line for as long as five minutes just breathing. The lies are killing me. He's actually staying on the clean lyrics. Will they hear them? I needed that to me again. And for the next year that we were together, three days here, four days there, my life became unrecognizable to me. I idly wondered what it would take to get me leaf. I wondered about this of a bottle of chilled white wine or heavy glasses half filled with scotch. I was still wondering about it when I went to stay for a while at a health spot in California. The phone rang in my room wounded. There had been a car crash on a snowy highway. My mother had 80 broken bones. My father was in a coma. They were lying in a hospital 3,000 miles away, and suddenly, in ways I could not have imagined seconds earlier, nothing else mattered. As I packed my bags, I remembered my mother, trolling, dancing to divorce her, through the doors of Linne's Browstone, and the glassy look in my father's eyes. I prayed that my father wouldn't die disappointed me, and I... What I have for you is there. Then you should hear, reading anART from your memoir, slow motion, true story, pop question youths.
