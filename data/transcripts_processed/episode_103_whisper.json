  "text": "Before he got sick, he pictured the world this way. There were people who were helping him. And people who were sick, happy people. And, unconsciously, as we all do, he drew a line between the two groups, the two countries. Then, when Paul Cowen was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, he was struck with the fact that these are not, of course, two different populations, sick and helping. Instead he wrote, the world was composed of the sick, and then not yet. He began denying ... of his illness in the village voice . I wanted to describe some of what I've seen during the voyage of Maine. The journey from being a person who took his help for granted, one is trying to survive a life-threatening illness. I want to chart some of this wilderness brothers and be here one day. Wow. That's the mission of today's radio program. Because all of us, you and me both. If we're lucky, if we don't die one way young. This is where we're headed. Heart disease, cancer. Man of a one and two. chance of getting cancer. Full of minutes one and three. If you're a man, hearing the sound of my voice right now, I want you to look at yourself for a moment. It's your meaner. I'll tell you I want it for some good. Or we'll both get it. Two other guys will go, I'll stop for you. So let us try this drain. Where if we all look long enough, we will be entering. How are you? During the past five months, I've learned that there's a land in the city. When you receive a passport and a welcome diagnosis, you wouldn't have to land as it's a land-page medical term knowledge. It's on geography, hospitals, outpatient clinics, blood test implants, doctor's offices, it's on citizens, other safety people. It's on pantheon of heroes and authority figures. Doctors, medical researchers, hospital administrators. It's on calendar, dictated by the changes in one's body by the results of medical. Leave the results mate. finds mess. When you will, it's right to remember what it's  to be said. And after just a brief time in the hospital, Kalan found it hard to remember what it was  for him just weeks before, to be active in self-sufficient. His picture of himself changed. He struggled to retain pies to the land of coffee, to see himself as an exile who would be turned wanted. But he's not. Well, from the BB-Eseesh Kaggle, the public video international, it's American life, I'm out of glass. First week's of course we bring you a variety of different stories on something. Today we bring you just one story. But that one person's journey from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. Today on our program seems to be transplanted. In 1995, Rebecca Pearl had a new baby boy, the Cheyenne of Carter Tom named Griffin. She was a health science reporter with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C., which she just wanted to keep out of your word for an investigative series about the tobacco industry. She did a lot of stories about doctors in medicine. Then she was diagnosed with non-hot chickens on phoma, and entered the medical world's in Haitian. She had six months of radiation chemotherapy. Didn't want to. So, in the winter of 1996, because I lasted time to save her life, she and Tom Travelled from the home in Maryland, on the Honda Brass. To the universe. University of Nebraska Medical Center for bone marrow transplant and another rapid chemotherapy around the chemotherapy as much as 10 times stronger than the original. Dan Kalesen, a friend of theirs in the radio producer went with them and he documented what happened. I guess you're interviewed back there a year later. This is an Australian. Daddy and Dan and I are going away with each for a little. We're going on a trip. We're going to stay with grandpa. and grandma, pop, pop and grandma, okay? Sometimes I worry that Griffins gonna fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that's what he sees as mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, it's gonna fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats barn bonds or something. Reeds or something. Since you go up, turning into this person, lies in bed all the time. For us, I lie on the couch and read him books or something. Once they were... three baby owls, Sarah, person. They lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their mother owl. The hole had twigs and leaves and owl feathers in it. It was their house. One night they woke up in their mother owl was gone. Where's mommy said, Sarah, oh my goodness, it Percy, I want my mommy said bill. He really likes the owl book and it makes him feel better, , the owl book mommy owl goes away but, and she comes. back. So I think he understands that. Lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I've had to do that. Now the really bad one is I'm going to have to go away for a month or more. He'll hopefully come visit. But still, , it's really long time. I mean, it happens, but and I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that I can have a mother. Okay. Okay. Five-by-griffy. We'll see you soon, okay? Bye-bye. You still can't find my mom. Say bye-bye. Okay, you gotta pack up. I'm gonna pack up. Yes. I will see you later. Oh, she is. You're in a park with Mario. Bye-bye, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Daddy. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You be okay When you find My matters is what you feel Better I I'm a dancer There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously set. First Tom, my partner of 10 years in the father of our son Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988. So he's supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia, and I don't think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I'm a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they're affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people. And they're off of the road trip. You got your warm coat? Okay, we got lots of turkey sandwiches. Maybe it was a little crazy to drive all the way to Omaha in the dead of winter, but I hate to fly and Tom likes road trips. I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at the Waffle House. We're in the bathroom of the Waffle House. Did you walk into it? Yeah, and I'm the... to give myself an injection of new prison. It was just  the heroin addict. For me, it was the worst part having to give myself shops. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through. And now the finest part is you jabbing into your leg. So, and then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts and sometimes it doesn't. Where you get it in the leg. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it for a while. That's it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for  10 days. I do it at  seven, 25, right before signposts. If it took me further five minutes to do it, I'd miss signpost. I'd hurry myself along. See now, I'm going to write you part of it. Eat it while I fall down the phone. Give myself a treat afterwards. Feel free to always. Mmm. How about I? I should get the milk. All right. Oh my. Let's go. pluslov blues read December 1st after 3 days on the road we make it to Omaha. I'm feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn't in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this my bladder hurts and I'm tired and I'm about to embark on a nasty exhaust and journey. I feel as if I need more strength. But here we go. And we're going to do your EKG right now. The first week in Omaha felt  boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another. Three more seconds. Keep going. A couple more breaths. That's good. Good test. Endless, pokey, prod it. I'm going to check if you're going to tell a poke in the burn. This is the numbing minute case. You can check any little poke. I'm sorry. I'm just getting some too little bit tough. One more to go with, it is honey. It's not bothering you either. I'm just tired of being hooked and prodding and fricking. , baby. I'm tired of you. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can't imagine a thing any worse. Tomorrow. Don't either turn down your midnight. to find. To our aunt, Aida Kloss, he'll go down to the first floor of the hospital, who's special X-rays. Kathy Bire was my nurse, a coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than what I was going through. We called her my drill source. , I would imagine it does feel  that because you lose that control. All of a sudden you're coming to a strange institution. They're telling you when, where, and what to do, immunolize the person. and that's young, independent, used to having her own kind of control. It's very frustrating. I'm a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren't used to push you New Yorkers no more. You got to get me on a later schedule, go to Exhauston, and I didn't  Kathy's cheerlead. How's the thing with you? How's the thing with you? I just wasn't in the mood, . I've been through a lot. already and I was tired and I remember she would say , positive attitude, positive attitude and you just felt  hell, , I just had a positive attitude the first time around and  it didn't work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse and I just was hard for me to keep positive. I can't have a perfect shot, I'm not going to get sick. One coping mechanism I did have was to act  a health report. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn't help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception. Hi, Graham Brasier. I'm here for a bone marrow transplant. Because it's multiple myeloma. So disease that was diagnosed on May 8th, Grandma's a young father facing worse odds than me. The latest statistics of it, three years out from Trump's prime, 35% of disease spree from the phone. His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their nine-month-old red-headed son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital, and even though Thomas made a mischievous, I was glad, Rick wasn't there in there. He was old. older than Tom's. He was nearly a year in a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much, and I didn't want him to have to understand anything. My gravy! Hi gravy! So I settled for the occasional phone call. Hey, gravy, want me to sing macaroni? I have a little pony. His name is back, a rony, drutt and drutt and then he stops. I'm so sorry. to pony, macaroni, do you  that song, gravy? I don't know, in a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself because I know you have to go through this and do this. So you're relaxing, I have to do before I can be with you. You have energy, energy, energy, and so. A lot of times, I don't have energy for him, and that makes it easier to come separate. So, gravy, I miss you, I'll see you soon, I love you. As love. Breathe in. Hold your breath. December 10th. We get some bad news. The cat scan shows the most recent. around a chemotherapy back in Washington hasn't shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha. Vexa has a mass pattern or CT scan, so we're going to administer another cycle of salvage chemotherapy that's a slightly different type to try and reduce that mass further down before she actually got to go to transplant and found it in the past. This is a best way to try and have the best life to knock up conditions. The good news is I'm actually feeling much better. So that night we celebrate. And now, the door is open. The door is open. And now the door is open. We're even out of the restaurant. Not just any restaurant but a fine, the restaurant. Catfish large here in Omaha. With the white-up vinyl catfish on the tank. ? I'm actually feeling good tonight. It's  a miracle. I haven't felt it. this. I'm not  crying or a pain or something. Two days later, I begin the Omaha chemo. They give you four drugs and one of them is blue. Kind of  the blue one. because it's just so startling. It looks   blue blue coloring kind of color. They're  blueberry frozen obstacle melted. Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison. The American Hanser Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better and know it sounded hokey at the time. Now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played habit with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me,  a separate person I couldn't trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn't mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn't hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was  looking at a holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually I've always been tiny and scrawny, but I never mind in the form. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat, even when the weather got warm. I did. break down and let Tom style a little bit of buzz that was still left on my head. Seuss. Whether it's small but very good. See I got to do a little spin and I'll just watch it. Don't be honest! I know it, I'm not a nut nut. But you should just zoom in. Don't be too fast. Breathe in. Hold your breath. I just had a CT scan. You can just compare the tumor. in the chest to how it was  an October sea if it's shrunk. The blue chemo hasn't shrunk the tumor either. So finally it's time to get on with the bone marrow treatment. I mean it's discouraging that the tumor hasn't shrunk any else. Hope , I'm sure you can keep these lost. Fun sure. Key mouse. So just anxious to get done and hopefully it's really going to work. And I'm kind of wondering about what's the chances of the tumor. And you can't be. good as they would be at the two-retron column. So, can we go ahead and get your consent form signed today, so we're already going. You're ready, go? Okay. The consent form is a reminder of what I'm in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things to cut and sometimes do happen. You have a bone maltransmitter. Kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure. It sounds really scary, and it's because we have to put every little less thing in your lick. It possibly happens. It doesn't mean it's going to happen. But we have to let  that's not possible. It didn't help to see the transplant patients were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going and they looked so weak, shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well. Everybody seems to be different than some people. Some people understand that the home ventilator is... ...but some of the worst things I experienced up there... ...by the nausea was locked to it. That was just a strange sensation where you draw freezes up and your tongue starts. It's sucking down your throat. People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. They're the ones who get their chemo and get out, and they're the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter a lot of patients have gotten into the lens. They're on respirators and they're taking a long time to recover. There's a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean. the most important thing in the world. We've been in the very cold. WOWFM, Omaha Council Bluffs. Good morning, I'm Mike. My granddad, the Omaha Metro area, as well as other areas in E-Cephal, Nebraska, Northern Nebraska and all of Southwest Iowa under a winter storm warning or blowing snow and dangerous windshills down to 65 to 70 below zero. As we wait, I'm thinking about what's going on. happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant which conjures up images of long dagger- needles being jabbed and it's fine, actually they collect the bone marrow or stem cells from my blood with a contraption, much  a dialisce. The machine borrows your blood, calls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It's the stem cells that produce red cells, white cell replacements, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemotherapy. Dr. Ruth Cassinger, Pine. treatment in Omaha. The machine empties the cells into a very important special bag. We take the bag of cells to the laboratory. And in the laboratory we freeze it in a liquid nitrogen. These are safe and there. Then the patient can go get his river cytosophil. The cytosophil of course is intended to kill tumor cells. but the doses are so high, then it also hurts the bone marrow, and that's the reason you need to get these stem cells back to the patient, so they couldn't grow a new bone marrow. So as soon as the hydros therapy's finished, and hopefully cancer's finished too, it's been killed. Then we get the cells out of the freezer, we saw them and we simply inject them back into the bloodstream of the patient. And  a miracle, these stem cells no work. They home right to the bone marrow. They have to be bone marrow space and begin to grow. Hi, can I help you? Hi, I'm just being mean. Okay, what's the name? Rebecca Pearl. Pearl? I think of it kind of  a pregnancy and  having a child,  the birth. I mean,  no one can tell you what's going to be . You kind of know it's going to be off all or that's what a lot of people say. And , but  what we can really tell you what it's really going to be . what I mean? different and it's just sort of  you don't have choice just gonna do it  it's just gonna happen and I just sort of feel it this and it's the same things I just gonna happen and I'm gonna do it I mean scary but my room looks  you could wash it down with a hose a vets examining it's an awful mustardy yellow it overlooks a great time I'm here for five days while they pour deadly medicines into my I would say it four days or so about three to four days. Now she's going to feel pretty sick to her stomach and maybe have some of the tools and some mouse source developing once all this chemo build up her system. Everybody have fun tonight. Everybody have fun. In the hospital there's the official information that the staff does out and there's the unofficial grapevine tips and advice that patients share with each other. From the better in patients, I hear that the University of Nebraska Medical Center doesn't  to give out soap print and anti-nausy a drug that's very expensive but works a charm when you're getting chemotherapy. So I start to insist on it to everyone I see. I tell the nurse, I'd  to have soap print because that's work for me in the past, the resident. But I really do want soap print because I know that work when I had each and the head doctor. I just feel  I said this to so many people so many times. I want to get so friend every day. Despite my requests, my demands, my begging, the first night they failed to give me so friend, and  grand, my jaws dip in some, a side effect of a cheaper, less effective anti-nozied drug. It's a reminder of what it means to be a patient. You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power. I find my high dose chemo. I find out that grams back in the... hospital on a ventilator. They think he has pneumonia and sepsis and infection of the blood that is common in hospitals and quite serious for transplant patients. Tom and Dan keep giving the updates about grams condition, but I don't really want to know. I kind of  to be a little bit removed from LSD also to go in. Well, because it's scary. It's hard for me to hear every detail that everyone else is doing. So that could be happening to me. The staff really did try to help me cope. And I did appreciate how genuinely nice mid-westerners are. But sometimes I just couldn't get with the program. Twice, rabbi is came into my room and left their business card and told me if I ever wanted to talk. And it was very awkward because they were there to try to... I don't know, so listen. Important things out of me about how I was feeling and nice didn't want to have... any part of it. I kept asking me, , social worker when first meeting in hospitals, saying, well, , you've all been in religion. No, you should say, well, I don't mean organized religion, but just, , your own spiritual act. No, say, well, what about, , some sort of mystical or, , some other culture kind of, are you involved in it? No, and, , no, no, no, no, to all her questions. I think she's to know exactly. it was to make it back because I don't think almost anybody had ever said no no no no those truths. What worked for me was to work. One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but there's a patient I had to be. a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics, and for support I had Tom who I call Zoolie and he was a huge comfort to me. Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something that we just sort of called truce or something, each of us did or something. We  almost never fight now and we just kind of both of us just pretty much kind of let things just cause love Why how if I'm pissed off because I'm just saying well, you must be does the same thing Of course we did have our moments If you get upset, I mean I want really just to I don't want you to be so if this is out of value I don't start about I'm not talking about my ego, I'm talking about if you want me to don't sit through this so You go out and just tell me what we're gonna do I'm right now I just kind of want to take care of me and  he's he's I think he really has a lot of ways or he's learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do what  just not to be care of me. I think it's really hard for him. she actually said to me that point was kind of enlightening to me that was she maybe she needs somebody to get that focus for her hostility or her anger without what's happening to her. So that that was actually an illuminating moment for maybe. stand up. January 16, my five days of chemo are over. Hear the beep? Anyway, that, I have my nurse please. That is the last bad of my last day of the last chemo. I have my nurse hospital. and hopefully ever. Johnny, we're a 20. It's a big day for Bill Clinton and for me too. He's being sworn in for his second term. I'm getting my stem cells back. They call it day zero because the recovery starts here. Tom and Dan keep trying to get me to say something profound getting my stem cells back,  getting my life back. It's true without these stem cells I would die. The chemo wiped out my body's ability to make blood cells. But I'm feeling too lousy to wax a poet. I feel nauseous. stomach hurts. I feel  I want to do this. to rock. Just dry ice. It's all very anti-finactic. Happy brings my stem cells up on the deep freeze in a flamethrower. she's ready for a beer and be. Okay, got another deep for all 7127-912. I'll take them five. But first I'll start. She thaws out the bag of stem cells  you would a frozen chicken breast. And... infuses them back into my body through the catheter. I'm froggy and half asleep for most of it. When I come to, I hear clink. Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For all of us are all that same journey of our lives. That night I feel a little bit. on the side of your sugar smacks. Take enough of sugar smacks, sugar smacks, sugar smacks. Take enough of sugar smacks. I take that home for tea. So remember all you cancer patients when you're feeling awful, try sugar smacks. Mmm, it's my food of choice. But over the next few days, as the chemo destroys my immune system, I feel as rotten as I've ever felt. This is rock bottom. I'm just so hungry that you can't dump hard skin skin violence too. For those who normally hamائ a lot of acne cause we don't have菱 harm Until we wound up in a school Or since our family hasn't been sightseeing, Not when it's looking  we're at a prison, a moment from being harm is burned so that those who don't care all they want will find themselves in the other 60-70-70 kinds of drug pulpit have betrayed�, Sasha got cured it would've been hopeless for a month again. Maybe boys with their homeless And without the energy that comes from blood cells, I feel fragile, anxious and empty. Well, it's January 21st. It's day one. I.E. I had my transplant yesterday. Isn't that right? Isn't it day two by now? God, I got this love. But I feel pretty crappy, feel very nauseous. And stomach is just very churny. Today. Hi! But I was sure I could stomach a piece of fried bread and some ginger ale and an eating through that. But I'd  to say it was almost pleasant growing up ginger ale. It's a lot better than growing up some other things I could need. orange juice. There's some comfort in knowing that I'm supposed to feel this way. The chemo can't distinguish between healthy cells and cancer. So it wipes out everything that grows fast. The lining of the day jet. festive track, the blood cells, hair follicles, one patient who's just been through it, a sure's meat will pass. I thought I was going to die two days ago and now I feel   I said as soon as you think it's never going to end, it does get better. I don't know how you feel right now. Dawn is a couple years older than me and has a 10 year old. Looking at her is  looking in a mirror. While I don't you find that's going to find two. every time you see pictures of your son or whatever, doesn't that mean you can just even more determine to get better. See it does mean to, or if I see my daughter, it's just makes me more determined. Right, right. Yeah. It just makes me more determined. , every time I think, oh God, I feel so bad. I don't want to go on. Then I just think, oh, what Jessica can do without. And it's , oh, I've got to kick myself in that seat and deal with it. Yeah, that's just a way of it. whole fight that I probably wouldn't fight half a sword except for Griffin. Well, choice to happen. No. I think if my life maybe was different. I mean, I think maybe if I, if there wasn't time in Griffin, , maybe I would say, , I'd live and I'd duck things and I just don't want to fight this anymore. , I just am tired of it. , get to keep going so it goes through that. But you can't do that. You have a key error. I don't feel  I can do that. I can't do that. It's not easy. It means a pain. Yeah. More of a better Pearl story in a minute, public video session, when our program continues. This is American Life, my reclass. Most weeks in our program we bring you a variety of different kinds of stories. Today we're dedicating our entire program to just one. But I want to try to be treated for a guy. in the illness. Empire Health Sciences reported Rebecca Pearl moved to Omaha for extra intensive chemotherapy in the bone marrow treatment. Did you want me to just cover this before? No, I just feel a little shaking now, unless you're a real artist here. Heh. Though my recovery was supposed to be outpatient, two days after the transplant, I'm back in the hospital. But Civic Department Ambassador Well, it's day three and I'm here because last night at about 11 o'clock. I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was lying in the bed, I just feel a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a beating really fast. And I counted  150 or 160 and it was really that with her normal Z80. I said, okay, get dressed, let's go. So I just kind of got out of it and started to come in in a nice second. to chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over. It's the next thing I knew I was , I'm a floor. And then I heard the thud. And I came running out. And Beck was, , spreading on her back, just flounder back, staring up and I went and looked in her face, looking her eyes. And she wasn't ready to ask her back. Can you hear me back? She just doesn't register me. was blind and that just scared of shit. That's something that really happened. she was in a hard attack or a stroke or something. And then within a couple seconds she came back and she was registered me. And then we walked out to the car and then we drove pretty completely to hospital. Suddenly there I can million nurses and PAs and then. internal mess and guys are in here. Looking me up to these monitors and seeing what's not in my heart and it was beating 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which  you just put into your catheter and it makes your heart stop for  three seconds and as weird, weird and unpleasant feeling kind of  an electrical feeling right after it. No, I just  electricity going through your body or something. I thought really weird and I still think I feel a little weird from that. And that got my heart rate down to  normal, ,  120. Hey, this is the final result. You have to go to the actual category though. It was no fluid around the heart. The thousand normal, the heart function normal. And then by the end of the day, that's a turn to a little somewhat of a great guy. And he says, I don't know what's wrong. You may never know. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again. And that's where we've left. And that's completely unsatisfactory, . So, they don't know. We don't know. They're not even going to treat it really. I can actually feel better if it's sort of thought it was something. Treat it. So you always think medicine's going to be  that. we'll find the answer and that'll be bad. A lot of times you just don't. We're no closer to knowing what the problem is and we start out really except that they think everything's okay, they think it's behind us and we're not really going to treat it. But I don't know why my heart was racing  that. Scared. That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it's  losing your innocence or something. It seems  the swear thing  my heart isn't supposed. to ever stop and my heart has been stopped. And to me that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It's almost  everything else is okay, but that really gets me something. And I wish that happened. So if we can treat this and get it under control, get the virus down before your white cells return, then that's the best way to do it. Four days after the transplant and I'm about to go home to our apartment, I'm busy worrying about Tom having to give me antibiotic injections at home. Except I don't have to worry about that because they tell me I have something called RSV. So we won't be getting out of here today, of course. away. We just really need to treat this. And  a week, we're weeks. The treatment requires I stay in the hospital isolation room for a week. And for 18 hours a day I have to wear this ridiculous looking and very uncomfortable mask strapped my face so I can breathe in an aerosol medicine. Here's something that people forget. It's not just physically grueling being sick. It's boring. Sheels tied around my nose, it feels sort of stuffy. It just feels  it's hard to sleep and because it's big and I feel kind of an elephant or something. It's just big nose. I can't be with it on or do anything. I just feel  I have to stay very still. Watching TV is good. Give me more documents, now I see what it's gonna do. But I'd better hit one more time. I mean, why not go to the news it is? That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck in that, , with that thing on my face. I didn't even believe it was happening to me. And also, So I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me at one point. , Dr. St. Hay, we're not doing this to you. Be mean. And he had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. And, but that anger kept me from being worried or scared because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would, , get something I guess were similar to pneumonia or I wouldn't be able to breathe. Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week. After Graham's eight-year-old daughter Kelly plays her flute for him, he seems to show some slight improvement, but the doctors say he's still in critical condition. It was a disconnect for me. I just didn't make the connection that there were all these other people on respirators and I could easily be one of them in a matter of day that just I didn't think it was going to happen. The big question that we can tweetly have wanted. I thought about until this point really is cancer itself. When the miss is this whole process right now and you're so Combered with daily routine and sucking our soul and getting your count down and so You're totally drawn into the process. You're not really thinking about the final goal at all Your cancer  that's there a little here that we're not thinking about that at all You did it. Yeah. Now it's just tidy things up. That's where they're huge, really. Finally, a piece of good news. Dr. Armatage, the head of the Omaha Transplant Program, drops by my room to tell me that the stem cells they transplanted into me are growing new cells. No one that you have in Antichrist, granite as I can't, made yourself, and you've been grafted, prepared of Chuck, you no longer at risk of sudden lethal infections. I mean, you've leaked over one other big barrier. And the fact that truth is you... If no, I'd think you're down here. It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small set back where I had had more chemo and when we looked at the tests that chemo hadn't done anything to shrink the tumor and so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn't even going to work and he said, , really without any information, he said, I'm very pleased with how everything went. With this under tone of you've probably made it. It's probably worked. You're probably okay. I don't know how he would have known that or maybe he was bluffing, but it was real reassuring to happen, come in and say those things. And your blood counselor looking great. What a whole set of things. I know if you saw that today. Day a let them. They'd just let me out of the hospital and all of a sudden it's over. Just as sure as I was locked away, they're gonna let me go. What do you say about getting your calf dry and getting home? How's that sound? For that. Congratulations. We just need to give you a nice little certificate saying you're out of here. So I've made it great talk. It was weird to me when they said, okay, you can go home and congratulations. Yay! And everybody clap. Kiss and hug. Oh, I'm so thrilled for you. Yeah. Thank you for helping us to choose. Oh, okay. That's  way to second. , I haven't won anything. Here, nothings. We don't know whether this worked. We know I got to brew this, but that's little. consolation, , they're really big prize here, the car, , the trip to Hawaii is did the cancer go away. And we didn't know and we weren't going to know for months. And so it was all very weird. Everybody can graduate and you and patting you on the back and saying good for you. And hey, it's all over now. And it's a very strange to me. TREATE. We'll see you next. of that kind of 100 years ago. Hey, bye. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music For the first couple weeks I was in Omaha. I felt  I was on an assembly line. You come in through a revolving door. You get on the line. You get your catheter, you get your stem cells removed, you get your high dose chemo, you get your stem cells back. So now I was leaving, walking fast, head up. Suddenly I was the veteran, the old pro. And there was a scared old man, his family, who had just arrived for his transplant, looking shake in small, as he sat huddled by his door. Yeah, you don't feel too good, but , at least it goes by pretty, , in a cup, , it's good as the white cells come back pretty fast. just a matter of about 10 days there were you really vulnerable. Then we say goodbye to Lorraine. How's her husband Graham is still on a respirator? She tells us that she's losing hope. Starting to feel  it's not my first place. I don't know that. I forget it Lorraine. I'm sorry. I tell her to be optimistic but I don't know why I'm saying this. In my heart I know she's right to birth. pair herself for Graham's death. It's not a good scene. Here I am leaving, getting out of town alive and Lorraine's world is falling apart. I feel terrible for her, but mostly I want to get the hell out of here. I want to run. Still I hug her and I tell her not to lose her. Well, it's pretty scary. That's pretty scary. It's early for that still. It's early about I have a weird sense of this whole thing with Graham because I mean, well now. looks bad for grand but for a while now I was thinking it could be  he could pull through and make it and the bone mattress was one really worked for me and I could be down make it be up and I mean nothing's guaranteed here at all okay we'll call you yes call you okay take care okay and you get angry accumulated I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Pretty got something. What? So I had to be away for so long. , I was away, but I'm back now. Are you my grippy? How you might be? I want to believe, and I think I basically do believe that this whole ordeal did not impact Griffey in that way. And I think that it didn't. Mom, Mom, he came back. Mom, they cried. They've plucked in the dance, and they bounced up and down on their branches. What's all the fuss their mother-out will set? You knew I'd come back, and the baby I was thought, because , all I was thinking Oh my God, Walter is gettinghy. I knew it said Sarah and I knew it said Percy. I love my mommy said Bill. Okay. D.T. D.T. Mommy. D.T. D.T. Harry Mommy. D.T. D.T. Mommy. And. And. Mommy. Oh, hi, is this the seventh floor Dylan maltransmit unit? I was trying to reach the rain brazer. I was trying to reach the rain brazer. I was on the unit myself, Rebecca Pearl, and I was just trying to find out about Graham. He's not in the running more. February 3rd, I've been home four days when I call back to Omaha to see how Graham's doing this morning. They just take him off the respirator. They didn't. He wasn't breathing. So weird. I mean this is what you're expect. . I mean it's rare that people die from a bone marrow chasm that gets happened. But it's rare when you get your own cells. I don't know, I just still sorry for a brain. She's got two little kids, , one is just one year. It's all the one is eight years old. Okay. That's a lot and it's just a lot that they won't have for fun. Springtime. The buds on the maple tree outside are bedroom window, have begun to sprout and so has my hair. I call this tree my hair tree because since I've been having My hair is falling out and grown back at the same time the tree has lost its leaves and sprouted new ones. The last half of the year, the terminal curve is for the median loading and us running a pasture. April 15, 3 months have gone by and we're back in Omaha. It's tax day and the day I find out if my transplant worked. This time, the last half of the year, the terminal curve is for the median loading and we're back in Omaha. time, we're only here for two days and Griffin is with us. Oh no. Oh no. Who is this? Good. How you doing? Take good care of mom. The news is good. Dr. Boast tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly. Ketsin, which will be good, they said that the mouse was shrinking. More of the mouse, less than what you checked in. Yeah. That's pretty cool to be in. We need to get our normal size for a look now. So let's definitely not smaller. It's hard to know for sure. I think we got as about as good news as we could. I mean, he could shrink a little bit more I suppose and it's possible that what we're seeing the reasons somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that they're scar tissue. So hopefully that's what it is and we're okay and so just let's. Nice This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore take a pot, throw it up in the air. we need that music,  you might just make it out through the room. You might just make it out through the room. You might just make it out through the room. It's funny when you realize you're going to get your life back. That your job isn't just fighting the disease anymore. Suddenly you have to live, eat, get, and get, and get your life back. You can't just sit around and wait to be better. You've got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology. Write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first because for the past year and a half, I've been doing very little reading, resting. looking through cat logs. I was scared to go back to work to face getting dressed every day, to be busy on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me. One year since my transplant, the tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease has gone. I'm back at work, but my energy is still low. I'm tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. and I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don't feel ecstatic, but I feel contempt. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick. Sometimes I think I wonder. If it changed me, , , armitize those the head doctor, , my heart. Set, , you don't go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel  I'm really just the same. But I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something. Things that shouldn't matter to me anymore, having gone through something  this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I... think I haven't changed and that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven't changed then I do everything the same then you can sit again. But if I can learn from this and change then I won't. Since mid-transplant produced by Dan Colison, helping Tom Jennings to win the story is dead.
