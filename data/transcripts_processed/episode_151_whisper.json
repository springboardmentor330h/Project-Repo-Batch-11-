It's very overwhelming to see such a great turnout this morning. I'm just so excited because I know it's very hard to get out of bed on this very, very cold New England morning. I just can give in the overwhelming task of introducing this amazing man. I am totally SaaS. features right now. I am just extremely excited. It started over again. The moment I looked in your eye. All of our stories today brought to you from New Hampshire where it has started again. But it's looking to call for a candidate candidates, pointing to voters. I'm very happy to be here this morning. This is a 70 something town hall meeting I've had in the city. of New Hampshire had a guy come the other day just before Christmas he said Senator McCain was the fifth town hall meeting you had that I attended and I said that's the ample testimony my inability to close the deal. Right we started all over again the moment I held you so I I want to talk about just a couple issues of the day with you because the thing I know about the people may have for the night particular and long-scooter. In fact, not even interested in short speeches. They're interested in making comments, asking questions, and in the patient's room. It started all over again. The moment I looked at you. Today in our program, people looking for something to believe in, and many of them finding it. And what they know about the candidates that you don't know. Take, for example, Harry Mostly in Burssia, Susenko. Three days into the beginning of the new millennium, the left home did something they had never done before. And hopped in a bus in Pennsylvania, headed up to New Hampshire, to volunteer for a presidential campaign. Harry had never been to New England before. He looked at the bus window, he says, such trees are close together, boxy houses, 100 years old. I was blown away,  what I mean? Because I was, I was tapping him on the bus. , , I was tapping his, , it was about 10 minutes from Manchester. So I'm tapping on him. I'm not  yo, that. I still get a scare, I mean, there's , I just, there's  country, in Pennsylvania, there's a different type of country. Yeah, and there's more , kind of , NASCAR, that the F type country. I mean, this is  American, God's , scary movie country, I mean. In rural New Hampshire, wherever Korea and Garcia went, they could pretty much count on being the only African Americans for miles, knocking on doors for their candidate. It's surprising. a number of people who wanted to tell them how great colon palace they tried to steer the conversation toward their candidate, go Bradley. That's a did-good trops, put it get a cannabis in kits and it signs for a Bradley event on Boston. , so he was a basketball player , lost the Celtics fast for a Bradley , go Bradley, you held Howard Chef, then , the week came over with the one , walk him to a new millennium, , , , we'll split up the world millennium. that I was , , sort of  the Bull Indian. what I mean? In one motivated these two college students, a hop on a bus, at their own expense, and hid north to work for free. It was one television appearance. When they're Sunday morning talk shows, where, as Carter remembers it, Bill Bradley said, the two biggest social problems facing America, are racism and materialism. materials. I'm not going to be that. It was  running against the very idea of America. That's  really when it went to mainstream, that's why I want America. On a day-to-day basis, I mean, I grew up in a low income community,  what I mean? When you're in poverty, you're at life as the fire by material. Things that you don't have it. You have lack of self-esteem. I mean, I mean, I want to have middle school, high school. If you have a certain person, think of people who may funny you. And that affects how you say you want to, I know kids who don't want to go to school. what I mean? I mean, I don't know what I mean. because they had a right period of sleep is on, but a right genes. what I mean? I used to make fun of people. Yeah, I mean, I'm guilty of it. what I mean? And no, and that,  what I mean? It's , it's  for someone to address that. And I just saw it. And I was , yeah, I cannot believe he just said this on TV. And then I started telling people, I was , yeah, I was doing. I was , well, this would be sad. I can't tell everybody, I know what he said. They're , I can't believe he said that he's never going to win. He's never going to win. I'm , he's , oh, when are the less people so? portal and so he bought his bus ticket from Manchester. Today on our program the politicians are looking for a way to connect with voters. The voters want candidates to inspire them. So how come so few of us are  a heart? How come so few of us have a candidate be allowed? Today we bring you stories that explain how come and stories of voters who have found inspiration. Back one of today's show is a little man. Sarah Valle. his high school class and conquered that decided to take on the national press. And to the mass behind the mass, which in a trepid reporter tries to get beyond the sound bites with Governor George W. Bush and succeeds, as well as anyone anyway. Factory, Payno attention to the candidate behind the mosh pit, in which we answer the question, what is a presidential campaign good for anyway? Stay with us. He's started all over again. We're going to make the middle man. Keren America here is how we interact with our political candidates. We dispatched the middle movement in the scene. They tell us what the candidates say. They research the candidates backgrounds. And they tell us what they think is most important. This middleman of course, on journalists, Sarah Val, has this table about the difference between the way the middleman see the world. And why non-journalists see. They'll start at when Joanne McGlens' Media Literacy Classic Concord High School in Vy. all the presidential candidates to speak. Known to loiter in New Hampshire's C-Slistly before the State's primary elections, a whopping 50% of the eight major candidates accepted. Allen keys, orange hatch, Gary Bauer, and Al Gore. They were asked to speak on the subject of school violence, not just because of the killing Zipala and Bine, but also because the Concord High School student was killed at school a couple of years ago. We were spoke to the student body on November 30. at 1999 and contrary to conventional wisdom regarding his charisma deficiency, he was a hit. Students Lucas Gallo actually pet and gale and the list is fell when we called him event. He wasn't a step as  people say he was. It comes out , hits you jack and offer whatever. He walks him out, no, I'm asking. I didn't participate in. He talks to the audience. There's a question that said, what do you  to do for fun? mentioned that he liked the sense he kind of understood that we are people we are kids But we're Not dumb we understand what's going on and he respected that I mean he was still going , but he wasn't He wasn't quite quite as stiff as He didn't just get up and talk  the other candidates then he was kind of neat to be good While the students were impressed by Gors EZ going manner his whole John McGlan was pleased with his content, the way he talked about school violence. He was very careful, I think, to describe the complicated nature of what might have caused what happened at home and by and he didn't say it was just because those two boys played video games. He used a little analogy about when you catch a cold or when you don't. He said that some kids in this auto-chop had the insulation of a loving family of teachers that cared about them, of a supportive school system, and said they perhaps were insulated from some of these outside forces, and as they were in their floor, were in need of committing those times of acts. Then during the question and answer period, something happened that seemed unremarkable at the time. Hello, my name is Shane's lecture. I want to say, or ask you a question. Do you think that how do you get students to get involved in more politics? He answered in a very lengthy response. He thought for a moment, paused and said, I know there's a lot of cynicism in the country right now and he said especially among young people. He said, I think that it's caused by a number of things. He said one of them may be that we need camp. and he went on and talked about how he supported became fine gold. He then said, but I think his kids should look in the mirror. I think that leaders can make a difference. But I think you also have to examine your own hearts. We are so privileged to live in this country. If that sounds corny to you, you should examine that attitude. Sir, think about South Africa. They just recently became a democracy. What the... They had their first election,  what the percentage turnout was? But 95%. People waited in lines to vote. There were seven miles long. Here we have a constantly declining voter turnout. I think it's because a lot of people feel  they cannot make an individual difference, but you can't. So, he challenged them to get involved. And then he said, let me tell you a little story. Now I'm going to play that. little story. In the days that followed Gores' parents, this story was twisted, distorted, and ultimately more caught over than a piece of Jerusalem real estate. Which is why I am going to play what he said in its entirety. We take a quick story. 20 years ago, I got a letter from a high school student in West Tennessee about how the war for family was drinking from a well-based economy. She wrote me how her grandfather had a mysterious ailment that paralyzed part of his body, that she was convinced was related to the water. Then her father also became mysteriously ill. People thought she was imagining things. She investigated and what we found was that one mile from her home, a... chemical company had dug up big trench and there were dumping millions of gallons of hazardous chemical waste into the ground. It had seeked in down into the water table and contaminated per families well and the well of other families in that rural area. I call for an congressional investigation and hearing. I looked around the country for other sites  that. I found a rural place in a construct standsает in shrieks, the New York called Look and Al. Had the first hearing on that issue and tuned teag't in a sea, that was the one you didn't hear of. But that was the one that started at all. We passed a major national law to clean up hazardous stuff sites. And we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country. We still got work to do. So we made a huge difference. And it all happened because one high school student got it. the night after the speech, Joanne McLean was at home in a friend called her asking if she'd seen New York Times. He said, did you notice the love canal comment? And I said, I said, I said, well, remember he told a story about love canal. I said, what kind of is, , the time says that Goor is taking credit for finding love canal. I thought,  oh, I got a bit nervous. I thought, is that the way this story is going to be covered? Let me read from Catherine Sealy's article in the New York Times on December. first. In a 17-care graph piece about one day in the Gore campaign, four paragraphs are devoted to the conquered high appearance. Seely-quad Gore, I found a little place in upstate New York called Love to Now. I had the first hearing on that issue and tuned Tennessee he said, but I was the one that started it all. Curiously, the Washington Post may be exact saying mistake. Also on December 1st, Post Deaf Writer Seely-quad Gore, I was the one. when it started to go . We came in one class and this one goes , you guys are not going to do this. And she wrote up the quote on the board and she said, do he say this? And we were , what? If he say this, I was the one that started at home, then we were , no, we was talking about the girl, that event started on. And then we looked at all the newspapers and we were , wow. She then played us back to tape that our TV production class had made. And... The actual quote was that was the one that started all referring to the city in Tennessee. We definitely said we have to do something about this and we're definitely having to shop that. Wow, that one little word. One little word, , totally changed the context and totally changed whatever you want to talk about it. After the times and the post, the love canal mistakes, no ball. U.S. News and World Report listed I was the one that started it all as one of its quotes of the week. And then there was the following little. roundtable on this week with Sam Donaldson and Hoki Roberts among the two hosts, George Steffenapolis and Bill Christophe. Well, come out. Yeah, he's got it, , board again to be at his people field problem. Says he was the, says he was the model for love story. He created the internet. And this time he sort of discovered love and how was kind of a sad story. Right. Right. He discovered love. I don't know. He had hearings on it after he was in a vacuum. Yeah, I found a little place in Upstate, , called Love Canal. I was the one who started it off. The late show with David Letterman dreamed up a list of the top 10 other achievements also claimed by Al Gore. Well, do you ask out of early 90s recession by personally buying 6,000 t-shirts? Number four, start in CBS situation comedy with one valedess entitled The One For Al Al for one. Number three, with interest in Brasilia's board song Crazy Train. Number two came up with popular catchphrase, don't go there girlfriend. And the number one other achievement claimed by Al Gore gave mankind fire. Initially the students were upset about the misquote, but the more they thought about it and the more they watched the misquote evolved, they were really glad regested by the misrepresentation of Gores of Parents at their school. He was trying to say that kids can make a difference. He was trying to say what so many high school kids. and it's kind of don't believe. He's running for president, so he has to be a bit selfish and kind of boost his own, boost himself and speaking. But the message they totally messed up the point of the entire story that he told, he was trying to make it a clear point for us that we need to get involved and that we should, and that we can do something to help and the media just, they didn't even mention the message that he's trying to explain to me. The actual quote itself was, I think, indeed. in the innocent. It wasn't a look how great I am, look what I did and love canal. It was a look how great you can be. That's what his message was and that's what the papers over looked. What if I was this reporter and I said, I'm sorry, Miss, yes, you're right. I didn't miss quote that but so what I still got the, I still got the just what it was doing right. Maybe he was trying to inspire you. That's one part of what he was saying. The second part of what you were saying is, ... I was the one who brought this to fruition, I outgour, look at me. I would say, , you're wrong. You're focusing on one little idiom, microscopic thing that, , when miscoded, it means something completely different, but one important correctly, it means a great thing for, , democracy. things  that. If I can come clean on whom I identify with the most in this story, it isn't the students or their teacher. I identify with the New York Times reporter Catherine Thielie who misheard a word. She was the one that started it all. I am convinced that this woman whose job it is to follow around a man with two jobs, running for president. and being vice president from beyond overworked. I know this partly because the first chance she got to return my phone call about all of this was at 115 in the morning. This poor reporter, this gatekeeper of democracy, was getting her first break of the day in the middle of the night. And considering that I am a writer who has publicly mispelled names, confused, sincere, who is with Upton Sin Claire, and gotten who knows how many things wrong on the... years, I am one pot you should not be calling the Gray Lady Black.\" Both in New York Times and the Washington Post did publish corrections, and this is what Seely told me. About the students of Concert High, she said, These kids are well-intentioned. They're paying attention. We did get one more drum. But they're magnifying what happened. Gord did say, I found a little town in upstate New York called Love Can Now. She continued, He called the A.K. and Buffalo the next day. and apologize for presuming to take credit for that. The journalists were in fact correct when they said that love can now was already a front-page story, an official national emergency months before Al Gore ever held hearings. But, as you heard yourself, Gore never claimed to have been the one to have first brought love canal to national attention. He only claimed to have held the first congressional hearings on it. I think what shocks me though is that there are scenes on some parts of the meeting that we've talked to. Very little remorse. That surprises me. I guess I have my own bias or perception as I look at the event. So wait before our goal, our entire school had to practice a lockdown procedure. And a lockdown procedure is something I never experienced except as a kid in Catholic school in Rhode Island, , in the early 60s. The nuns had us hiding under our desks, , to are putting our heads down to protect us from nuclear. Follow. And when the Russians were going to biomass. And now in 1999, we were in 1999 being asked to run through an event as though a sniper route in the hallway. This came down as a recommendation. from the state of New Hampshire, their safety point in group. And it just so happened that we had our first crack decision the week before our go-to-computer high school. So our principal came over the intercom and said teachers, please implement the lockdown procedure. We knew a head of time, this was going to happen. Sometime during the next two days, I had to take my freshman and move them away from the door, get them on the floor, turn their desks on their sides so they would be protected as much as they could be. In case someone came. into the remote, tended to come into the remote with a gun. We had to be silent. I had to go out in the hallway and rock the door and grab any kid who might have been returning from the bathroom. Hoping this kid was not the person that we needed to worry about. Grab that kid, pull them in, and ask my students to be quiet. I had to tell you it was very unsettling. Let's saw that one of ours, one of our students could be out in the hallway, trying to harm us, but it's a very... complicated emotional response. Many of us were very uncomfortable during the lockdown. But couldn't show that to the kids. Why did the kids, or they were safe and not to worry? So my, I thought, Gordon, a good job talking about this issue. I thought this was an issue that should be one of the prime ones in our presidential campaign. And I feared immediately when I heard love canal that somehow what had happened at Kirk at High would become a joke. And in some ways that did that is what happened. Let's talk about Al Gore and have some fun. We've gotten to the series part of the program. Now here's the hilarious part. Al Gore keeps taking a little bit of truth and building it up to into this sort of an ethical law in history he plays. , it just makes me sad that the wise guy attitude seems to dominate the press right now. And that's what I picked up on. Not to pick on. Chris Matthews, but he spent two nights having a blast with this story about Love Knit. Getting a bit chuckle out, , Dan Quail may not be able to spell potato, but now Al Gore is going to claim he invented it. , Chris Matthews refers to Al Gore and Zoey. Well, there's Al Gore. What is it? The Zoey guy who keeps saying, I was the main character in Love Story. I invented the internet. I can probably invented Love's gonna. I think he had been more writing these speakers. genre Well, maybe we're Chris works that seemed  a funny thing to say, but where I work, it didn't seem that funny. Where I work, hiding some day, pretending to be hiding behind desks with kids, afraid that, , the cleapold and Harris or outside my door, it didn't seem that funny. It really didn't seem that funny. And I'm not saying our candidates should be. untested, unquestioned, uncriticized. I'm not saying that in the least, but I am saying, if that's all we do, and if all we do is make fun of them, then we're losing something too, I think. I feel  some reporter just printing stuff that doesn't promote anybody anymore that is saying what they did wrong. I asked 16-year-old Ashley Pettingell what we lose when the press omits descriptions of how a candidate might actually... making dude president. I think we miss out on that. Every reason the vote for them. A conquered high school of politician actually spoke inspiringly and connected with the audience, which to me is news. But no reporter reported this. And in fact these kind of moments are routine. over-look by the press. They're barely part of our national political discourse. But why? For one thing, so much political speech is lies, spin, and misrepresentation. It's understandable that journalists report these inspiring moments skeptically. If at all. And beyond that, the way most of the press works is pretty much as you suspect. Representatives of the news media carry around storylines of the candidates in their heads and report is more. light up when reality randomly corroborates these pictures. One of the great mysteries of modern politics is which storylines get told and which get ignored. And in the primary season, that storyline is still up for grabs. John McCain's storyline, Hero, threatened to become hypocrite in light of his helping the major donor with the FCC. Not long after George W. Bush flunked a foreign policy pop quiz, it appeared his name in the увидendall. the correspondence dinner was destined to read, hello, my name is Dunderhand. Gore's storyline that he's a bore is by step by this secondary storyline that he's a braggard that he takes credit for ridiculous things for inventing the internet and for being the real life Oliver of Love Story. So of course the love can now misunderstanding screened to reporters because it brought this particular fuzzy snapshot of Gaur in the sharper focus. Eading to openly 4 México last week is telling that both the reporters for the times and the ones that the post heard the exact same word incorrectly. Almost as if that was what they wanted to hear. He took Joe and McClend says that this is a seductive impulse for both reporters and voters. This editor for U.S. News and World of Court called and said that. And this was after he admitted he was sorry that they had published a misquote. He told me a story about George Bush Sr. running. president in 1992. And I remember the story myself that George Bush went into a supermarket and was stunned to find a scanner. I guess was used to roll cash registers and supposed an and made a comment that showed who was surprised to see a scanner. What this gentleman from the Western World Court told me was actually the pull recorder that that story was raw. It was actually some kind of new skin that Bush remarked. But that comment then became sort of disembowl or the iconic moment for Bush being out of touch with middle America. And that was it. I think that might have hurt Bush the time. Now it turned out if this man is right, the new President was a little report. Not to be accurate. Now, if it wasn't accurate, wasn't not true. I mean, was Bush out of touch with middle America? It's the same thing going back to Goor. for take credit. It makes me question and I have to say, I am going to keep my eyes open in a way I hadn't be through and particularly when things automatically fit my mindset. Now, I'm going to be a little careful. I mean, I didn't surprise me that maybe President Bush didn't know about a scanner. But if he did, it's too bad that Karabia is not who. I looked at Joanne McClend syllabus for her media literacy course, but when she handed out at the beginning of the year stating the goals of the class. By the end of the year, she hoped her students would be better able to challenge everything from novels to news tasks. Today, would come to identify just who is telling a story and how that person's point of view affects the story being told. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this lesson. has been learned. In fact, just recently a student came up to McClent and told her something all good teachers dream of hearing. The girl told the teacher that she was listening to the radio singing along with her favorite song. And halfway through the sing along, she stopped and asked herself, what am I singing? What are these words mean? What are they trying to tell me? And then this young citizen of the Republic jokingly complain, I can't even turn on the radio without thinking more. Sarah Val is a columnist for Sloan, the online magazine. She has a new collection of essays coming out, called Take the Canola. Coming up the finger-wagoned styles of presidential candidates throughout history, and how George W. Bush acts in his own car. That's in a minute. From Public Radio International, we're in our program continues. It's an American life from my class. But you can have program with course which is a theme in the variety of different kinds of stories from that in today's show. Tales, the New Hampshire primary. It's a lot of work. It's so hard for us to feel inspired by and connected to presidential candidates and the people who have managed that trick. We have arrived at a two of our program and two, the master behind the mask. The program owners always seem more protected. They are always the least spontaneous than most packaged. They have the most used from a gap afro and they have more. people gunning for him. Take George W. Bush. In the Bay to offer repeat the same few answers to several different questions, Sarah Canning is uncovering the Bush campaign for months, the newspaper the country's monitor and answer, trying to get to know the real George W. Bush, man behind the message. I am in Austin, sitting in the back of George W. Bush's dusty blue lint and town car. He's twisting a gum wrapper around and around his finger and he's crouching. He's fighting the flu. I find out later. But right now I think I must be letting him down somehow. Back in his office at the State House, I had asked him about Texas politics and education reform. He seemed bored. His eyes moved around distractedly, and his answers were the same ones I had heard him in tone on the stump in New Hampshire, about the American dream touching every willing heart. Suddenly he announced the interview was over. Bush must have sent my disappointment because he said I could ride with him from his office to the governor's. mention. If I want to. He sits in the front seat and I sit in back and after two and a half blocks we arrive at the mansion. The driver pulls under the cortico but pushed doesn't  or he stops. So he makes him move up a few inches. I consider that a while, those few inches. After covering George Bush for months, this is what I've come to. I'm thinking any movie makes that isn't on a campaign. schedule. Anything he says that isn't scripted. Even something as small as this might be a clue to figuring out who he really is. In New Hampshire, Bush had been friendly. He even seems to  me. After just one meeting, he almost remembered who I was. We were next to each other in this heating mass of reporters and townspeople , and he squinted at me in pointin. Yeah, alright? No, go. I think he asked my name and after that he knew who I was. He would wink at me from the vortex of huge crowds. Once he walked past me on his way to deliver a speech about education policy, and he pinched my elbow. When I was on his bus with some other reporters, he patted my knee. This wasn't flirting. It was a kind of affectionate teasing. It's a side of George Bush. You don't see on television. You don't see how he lanes in so close to people who looks as if he's going to kiss. them. You don't hear the nicknames, the wise crafts, the sides. But off-screen, he bestows them liberally, especially to the press. A baby would cry and he blamed the guy from the Houston Chronicle. He'd make the New York Times reporter giggle by telling him to get a haircut. So here we are in Austin, part in front of the mansion, sitting in the Lincoln towncar, and despite our charming rapport, the interview is proceeding as verbally. Our conversation is peatering out, and I think he's going to ditch any second. But he doesn't. Instead, he faces the windshield and his voice gets quiet. And that's when he mentions his nest. He likes campaigning, he says. But he longs for the comforting feeling of being around his own cats and dog. One thing about campaigning that I miss is not being in my nest, he says. It occurs to me that this is perhaps the first thing he's ever said to me that he hasn't said to anyone else. His eighths tell me to be at the mansion at 6am the next day if I want to observe bushing interviewed by a terminal. I go. In a fatherly tone, he recites for the boy the same platform points that have already saturated the national news, including that kid-friendly one about developing antipolistic missile systems. Afterward, we chat in one of the period sitting rooms and bushel operates on his next-in pattern. He's the first step who walks the dog. He feeds the little cat. that sleeps inside, he lets in the yellow cap that sleeps outside. He feeds a little black cap that stays outside all the time. He makes coffee and brings it to the first lady. They read newspapers in the sack. Then he has a light breakfast and gets dressed and wanders around the house looking for something to do, who's at work by 7.30 or 8. I tell him I'm impressed, and that I'm tired. It's now 6.30 in the morning. He asks me how old I am. 30 in tell him. See, I was sluggish to at 30 in his house. He tells me by the time I'm his age, 53, I'll be more energetic. Your biological clock, he says. It's  clockwork. Maybe I have just glimpsed the real George Bush. Maybe the real George Bush talks about his nest. Weeks later, I ask one of Bush's aids about him. And the last one, it said that the black. Yes, yes, the black one was black. He likes his routine. He likes getting up in the morning, letting the dog go. Jimin was similarly active, the genitals arrived. Then, he was hanging  this. Make him go after his town. No, no, he's right. He's , no. So, what's wrong? Is that your grandmother? Well, she never happened. Anyway, he's gay. If he really likes it, he may be more handsome. But once you take the joke and pretend you don't really know out, , , playing with the dogs feeding the cats, picking up the newspapers, going upstairs, making some coffee, reading the newspapers. As he said, has used the word nest? I believe he's used the word nest before. In one sense, you want to give Bush and all these politicians a great. You have to talk to the story. people every day, and are trying to win over every single one. It's  trying to end a date with an entire village. How many charming stories? Stories that we'd be willing to broadcast. Stories that have to be personal, but not too personal. Does any of us have? It doesn't? Half-design? A figurative bush was not in position to tell me who he was. Maybe people who had been around him in Texas could. I called Harvey Conberg. A veteran pl... who describes himself  many Texans do as a liberal Republican or a moderate Democrat. Cronberg tells me the Texas press had the same difficulty getting to know Bush when he was first running through governor. He had a status, a stump speech, and at that time he was running on four principles. Two-poil justice reform, education reform, two reform, and a welfare reform. You just could not work. came off those four items on his agenda. You would have about the weather. It would also be back to education before the court reform. It was very frustrating. And you began to  folks are expecting that. It might be lesser. It would be beyond. Some press court position. We were all pretty doubtful. I think going into his first legislative session. So, what he had for the federal law is our own goal. Court with the plus of surprise. Special proof. Kronberg said once he took office. Push-Luson-Duck, and understood the state's business as shrewdly as any of his predecessors. Sadly, for us non-Talpsons. Now that Push is again running for office, he's back on message in every conversation. Except on his either joking around or annoying. Those are the moments when Push seems most real to me. In moments of irritation, you can glimpse his vulnerability, his youth even. Back in New Hampshire, I make another attempt to slip behind the sound bites. I know he reads the Bible every day, and I decide to ask him about it. I borrow a Gideon Bible from a holiday in and bring it to a press availability in Portsmouth. Is there a particular passage he turns to for strength, I ask him? Is there a part going to be Matthew? And one of the great parts of Matthews is chapter called Diatitudes. I think it's good that people read the data, if you matter what your religion may be. If you think about religion in politics, I want you to, , I answer questions about my religion. It's on mindful of what happens in politics. When politicians say vote for me, I'm superior to you, as not what I'm saying. In fact, I'm coming from the different perspectives. I want people to know that I'm a person who seeks religion because I realize I too am a sinner. I'm a sinner. And I do need strike. You mean to show you the way the attitudes are? Is this a test? No, it's not a chance. I have it ready so I could possibly ask the student. You've never read the Bible? I have it. That's okay. I still  you the first thing. I'm more worried about your stories on the handworthy reservoir. I'm hoping not. Who's in the... Where am I? now. How was reading about the house divided by itself? I don't know if stairs are getting stuck in the woods anymore. So I don't think you think I read the Bible, did? No, I think so. Why don't you move to that? I'm just curious, let's go. a very interesting line of question that you can make a show you were on exactly in the lab at this one. Essentially, I never happened before in the midst of a crescent of the same. Anyway! He finds the section he's looking for and holds it up so everyone can see. We all know. Finally, I ask an outright how close the real George Bushes to the one we see campaigning. If there are parts of himself, he withholds from the public. This isn't falling into sight. level of it. Right, yeah. That's a very interesting question, Sarah. If there were, I don't think I could, and this is a process that pretty much over time it exposes all. I don't think it's very hard to be a private person in the midst of a very public campaign. I, and you're watching me very quickly. closely, he glances into my heart and my, what makes me tick over time. His wife Laura, gently knocks in the door and comes in. There are words to get a habit of a cycle battling, much more than you ever draft. The question was, the question was, would you care to cycle battle a bunch yourself? There are moments. when I  to be alone, I am bad people don't know about me that I am a person of routines around the house. I will give you a routine that I miss a lot in that early morning. I love the way up particularly if I have to sleep and the first thing that happens is one of the We'll kind of come up and jump on the bad guys. We've got three cats to stay outside tonight. I wanted to see him say, we have one dog, he's speaking inside and night outside. And I walked on the night one and he's kicking me. Everyone I talked to about Bush, his friends, his colleagues, his brother, Jeb. So the man they know is the same at home as he isn't working. The same one we see. I'll do it. watching for months I think that's probably true with one caveat. For now, every story details in public has a purpose. Take the Nesting Story. Once I've heard it three times, I finally realized Bush's message is this. I do not snort cocaine or dance naked on tabletops. I might live in a mansion, but I make my own coffee. I do not think a presidency is my birthright. I'm a humble, loving, family man, satisfied by simple pleasures such as providing for those weaker than myself  my pants. I love my home, I love my nest, I don't mind sharing that with you. The good I understand how public my life is and the course of it won't be. Sarah Cannon is a political reporter of the Concord Monitor. My heart is breaking, all the minions here drop start to flow. At three, Hano attention to the man behind the mosh pit. In the cynical age, we end our show today with a story of citizens who feel perfectly connected to their candidate of choice, who feel inspired by him. This American life producer Alex Bonbert tells the story. Let's play a little game. I'll describe a group of people. You guessed the candidate is one. Ready? It's a couple of dozen teenagers outside the presidential primary debates in Durham, Hampshire. They're all wearing bright wearing tushlets, talking about punk rock and skateboarding. I'm a freezing cold. One of the kids is wearing nothing that jeans in the tushroom. Give up. It's pretty cold out here, but I'm freezing for a reason. And that reason is day four. Nazis! We're complete! Bring the boy around and bring his boy around, bring his boy around, bring his boy around. Meat, youth reports. Bring the boy around, bring his boy around. The group of young people is so psyched about their new family, they're published with candidates that they'll burst into spontaneous cheering at the slightest provocation. Witness this excuse. So where's the, where are you guys going now? Don't let other bodies be blown, and how to sit in the hall. We're going to party these people. Let them with you guys. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there are a hard bit in reporters out there who could resist such an enthusiasm. perception, but I am not wondering. As we walk to the hand from the eight-site, I establish a few facts. They're not paid, they get no school credit, and though they're almost all from Republican families, their parents have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that they're all in here. Very few of their parents in support sleep works. These kids are here because in their view nothing could be more fun. We get to the hall where in Hampshire's board securities have gathered to watch their debate and big school. to do. It's striking that of the almost 200 people here, fully half of them aren't all enough to vote. The Forbes campaign, in terms to have the biggest Republican youth organization in the hamster. And when you go to camp hand events, this crime seems believable. There are always more young people there from Forbes, which is incredible in think of it. Steve Forbes, the flat tax candidate? I mean, can there be an issue less likely to inspire the nation's youth in the US tax code? Most teenagers haven't even seen it. 1040. This guy will be a male and postcard. That's going to be great. That's going to be so much easier than anything else, especially reading through all the laws and filling out a 10-day report. Aside from the views on taxes, most of what the Forbes kids say isn't what you typically call conservative. When I do pin them down on what issues they care about, they try to outbees suspiciously liberal chessness, global warming, and education. I ask, how Forbes plan to radically scale back the size of government will help address these issues. an athletic type in John, 12 minutes in pretty matter of resource allocation. For example, in the Manchester, a lot of money that has a couple of years has been spent in law enforcement, trying to take skateboarding off the streets. And this is, we all say more. By the way, yeah, put a, not to be biased for him, but a lot of, , wasted money was used to hire more in cops, to just go downtown and boost people for having a fun time. That money couldn't spend on education during down to little speech. All the kids were crowding around and making these funny little hand gestures. They were  this. Hold your hand with your fingers extended in a karate chop position. Then fold the bottom two fingers back into your palm. The kids held both hands in this position. Two fingers extended and sort of chop them up and down as John taught. Fifteen or twenty of them. I'll be doing it once. I asked one of them about it. Oh, that just what Steve does. pots might say it's very French-miren-s-m-s. And then Ted demonstrates how the gesture fits into a timeline of presidential hand-possils. He makes a fist is thumb on top. Yes, yes, with the thumb. See my thumb is that my index you went. Do do do do do. He takes the thumb into the fist. And then don't clenze the thumb inside  this. And see if the core of this just isn't open hand  this. Now the two fingers in. See if you can tell how excited it is. I have high in the air, this hand is you. I've only seen up  eyebrow level. Some people have seen overheads up. Oh, what? Overhead of mine, actually. I feel it overhead when we bring a lot of people to the rallies. You see, this is... Jump sit in this beast about those who's parody. Just  he said. He jump. He's a... he's a... he's a... Jump just go to work. That's the only one that's on the arm. What are we doing, please? We're on the arm. What are we doing? At the car side of the room, the president should be... on television and at the certain point the quality of the clubs is on his way. I mean I mean people millions of people are watching this at home and they're going to go home tomorrow's go to school tomorrow and say yeah I watched it on TV well we didn't watch it we made it happen we this was this great we were we were here He said he wants to hide up. Whoops, I'm theorized. And the kids and personalities of his oratorical style are remarkably accurate. His hands karate chop up and down on every syllable. He looks  a badly operated puppet. Before I go, I do want to, well, you can visit handmills for the new meta. Want to do it for the latest, the superfluous ladies, the latest part, the oldest, the oldest, the oldest, the oldest. The name of the Constitution is a question for the West Savannah. At this, kids spontaneously burst into wind and grunk we are not worthy of the house in the direction of Forbes life. She beams it. They beam back. They've gone through this ritual before. On his way out after finishing a speech, Forbes walked up to some of the kids, including Ryan and Chris, and shook their hands. Is he agreeing? Yes, he shook my knees. He said, thank you for the support. andaag-hardened guy. 幫ing him. It's... Who's the first time I landed on a misdeep lap? Mr. Flip. He's snowboarding in the room, in which the rider turns it forward, some are soft, well at the same time rotating his body at sea. Let's continue. I'm sorry, I could have missed it, of course. I was just a day, I'd been. When I catch up with the candidate himself, he's clearly free enough with his new time popularity among the cool kids. Even if he doesn't completely understand me. Do  what I'm missedy? What is? I  the vanilla stuff and the vanilla stuff. I'm just a chocolate. Because I'm a tell me that his campaigns and idealistic work. And that's part of the appeal to teenagers. But it's still doesn't explain the essential question. How did the stiff, socially awkward man crown the passions of the hamster's skatepunks? Well, neat 21-year-old, my company. I get that question a lot. I get a lot of, well, . how do we get kids out to support a candidate who may not be well-smoored and may not be well-funny. I wish I could say that all I had to do was wave the picture of Steve Forbes in front of the face of the Republican rally. I can't do that. Mike Dalban is a regional youth coordinator for the 2014. He's also the reason all these teenagers loves to be a Forbes. How does he do it? One of his main recruiting tricks is simply being Mike Dalban. Chelsea White. one of my three crutes says that when Mike came to her school, do somehow different than the competition. I then came for Bush, he was just born. he had no idea what he was talking about, he had nothing to say. He just talked about himself and he didn't really say, , we get to do this and we get to do that. We just said, well, for Bush, oh, for Bush, you're just , hey, nope. So what exactly did Mike say? I'm just going to say that made following me sound so fun, so appealing. That's just... signed up with Forbes. He was just telling us about all the campaigns and debates and , let draw some what  everybody does and stuff. Okay. Nick, perhaps. What I always tried was I was trying to take everything that we do and put a fun twist on it. Not only when we actually do it, but when I explain it. ,  a literature job, you take a literature job that adults are doing. They'll walk up with a piece of literature to a door that knock on the door and personal come out to us. introduce themselves to explain this is a literature for Steve Forbes. We would  you to come boat, , and they'll take hours and hours to do it. Youth for Forbes, we take literature, we hang it on the door now, we knock, ring the doorbell, and run away. We're ringing and running for Forbes. Bringing your money for Forbes is exactly what we do. Absolutely. And we have a great time doing it. We have a great time doing it. Yeah. I asked them to just come try it. They just come try it once. And they come out. They can feel the excitement of the campaign, the excitement of the lights, the cameras. And I always give them the opportunity to beat the cabinet. I think if you take a kid who says, I don't care about politics, oh, I can't, . And you put them in the room with a presidential cabinet. And... , the presidential candidate wants to over-stop some of the most right behind. This low-end shakes his hand. As tough as that kid tries to be tough, , this is actually a winner. All the hair on the back of his neck is going to stand up and he's going to go away if you don't want to tickle him because , people need and want and appreciate being part of some confusion.

I'm at the office almost every day, just recruiting and making phone calls and doing any other jobs they need. Bye! something that I actually want to do for the rest of my life, politics. Say hypothetically, Forbes doesn't get the nomination in the schoolman. All the hours, all the volunteers, all the cold calls. What does it accomplish to run for president and lose? What does a failed presidential bid create? It's entirely possible that the most lasting achievement of the Forbes campaign will be our target. the lives of these teenagers. True believers in the flat text, true believers in political process. As New Hampshire's finest punk rock blasts through the club's speakers, I watch the kids, future campaign managers, press temperatures, political strategies, flame themselves around the future.
