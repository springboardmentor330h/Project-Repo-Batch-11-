  "text": "This American life, America, is where we had planned originally on doing the show that would be kind of light and funny, but we knew some Tuesday we all lost part of that. And said about looking from the material that we're in some way, we're quite in a room name, what I think most of us are feeling in the way we're destruction and world traits and in the can of room. We're going to have a show of news stories next week. Till then we put together this hour of stories. which people were black-known-roars and tried to make sense of, I think, don't exactly make sense. Princess is story. When Martin was the teen, his father was shy and young. And Martin reacted  a teen girl who went at the age of his relatives. And he would listen to an age declared that someday, when he grew up, he would become a pro for pop there. And he would find the man who shot his pop. It's really good. When I look back at that kid that 15-year-old kid making their palms sits, it's that of me. But it's such a, it's such a particular vision of what a pro football player is, which is to say, it's a kid you're trying to conjure the notion of simply who's very powerful, but also pure somehow. Yes, I remember even then some friends saying, I'm , , who football is kind of a lofty goal, , just maybe high school football. Hello. гр , I thought, plan Emily, I thought you wereopaed yet removing those I thought I would  the back of my tongue. Yeah, geez, the kids, the kids, the edges was killed. I disabuse them of some vision he's got. Markstad was barren in Fresno, California. Two men came into the bar, played a game of four, four or two beers, then came into the background in the shot of. They didn't take any money. It was a gangwin's style hit. And it was talk that Mark's father must be caught up with organized crime. So 15. started calling her out and to his motherman's top. 17 years later he moved back to Fresno by this time he was a reporter for the L.A. Times and he wanted to write a book investigating his dad's murder. He was so skittish that he and his wife got their home under assumed names. Did not tell people where they lived? It's hard to make sense of all that there was a great deal of calm on them. I didn't want family to really know what I was doing. I thought it was a way too. So when that nerve was spun, the question was, I was asking, I want to make a difficult for them to try and find me. And I never changed my sleep patterns. So I thought I was awake all the night. And I was running the house and I was actually done with this. And I had an encounter, she was sleeping in the cage. In a way I became very childlike me. I really had to. 15 minutes and some minutes to get happy soon. But how do you mean? Well, I think it wasn't terribly dull to try to make you come back to your hometown. Try to hide your dinner. It's not. In somebody who goes to a stice, part of this can remain suspended there. At the moment it happened. And we stayed there, part of the stays there. turning the whole thing over and over in our hands. Mark spent three years talking to him for him and said his father's murder. He went through police files and lost phone records. Then the end found credible evidence that his father was murdered just as he was about to go to the whistle on a drug ring. One with local police on his side run for games. He wrote his book about it. It's called In My Father's Name. He instilled up his dad in the house. He's still not in the house. And I have been liberated by some of those eights. It's his son. I don't know. And he was just on the phone. Talk. I think there's a part of me that wants to sit across from the man who said this whole from up and talking to him on. You went them to admit it to your head. Yeah, that's my one thing to do. I played over that encounter with killer some times and one of the things that I've thought in his being clear of dust and fodder and target that was unwell and No further than you and me. Zip, just want my one. Ask you one question. Would you respond to me for the movie one phone? It, and so actually you actually imagined this over and over to your phone. Imagine it all the time. Welcome to the Easy Chicago and Public Radio International. It's a American line. Am I regardless? Today on our program, people trying to make sense of things for which they'll never get answers. Good answers. real peace. Hothry stories in our program today are about people facing the idea of death, and telling themselves one thing better than another, and is there anything that can be said, is there anything that can comfort us in that situation? At one of our programs, the experience trying to comprehend what it means when people were there of I and your life one day, and the next gone. Back to look for the union label. Father and daughter sit down together, no real reason. because we are really, to write his obituary, not really thinking about what it needs. And then at some point someone starts to think about what it means. At three, ashes, David Taderis talks about the death of the mother. Stay with us. At one, the disappearance. And then the mess. The remarkable books that I've read in a while is by a woman named Genevieve Jurgensen, a better husband go around and she lost their two daughters, at least until the age of four and seven. The book is a series of letters that she wrote to her friend 12 years after their deaths. And one of the things that's remarkable about it is how she still struggles. She doesn't want to keep suffering over their deaths, but suffering over them is the last way that she has to go up. She's also keenly aware that she wants them to seem. In the end, these letters to be more than just names. , when you tell a story about somebody, it's sometimes hard for them to see more just a character in a story and she keeps trying over and over to find ways to make it real. Then in fact, they were alive. They are more than can be expressed. You never knew our daughters. Neither did  me as I was when you were alive. I would have to tell you everything. And one really tells a one about. very young children. I will not even show you photographs of them. All they show are two little girls barely distinguishable from each other. Just  all the little blonde children which people primary school classes in the beaches along the Atlantic coast in the summer. On the 29th of April 1980 the official photographer for the school which my daughters attended came to take some class photographs. They were both dead the next day. Indeed we did not receive photographs until so that after the news of our solitude. Matilda's class is in uniform, so it is a picture of a little girl in maybe blue in her room, stifling her giggles in between her best friends. A lease who was still in the nursery class is wearing the dress with the sailor calling for my mother David. She is sitting in the first room, looking solemnly at the lens. I think that in this picture she is really very  me. In Matilda's, Sacho. I still have a school overall with her name embroidered on it with its instincts and vis-à-vis drums and apartments. In her exercise book, in her child's respectful handbraining, she is written date which will be the date of her death and death of her little sister. In staying, 30th April, 19th. What else can I tell you? I would  you to have heard me talking to them just once, even if only on a telephone. I still have a... I was in trying to make you accept this evidence they were here. I was in mother. I went to pick them up at school, we stopped the supermarket to buy two cheap waxed coats, one in red, one in blue, and I dropped them off with my mother, not before playing the practical joke on her, I'm landing. I've bundled my daughters up in the coats with hoods up, pull tightly open noses and tied under their chains. They rang the bell and tied her head and my mother pretend not to recognize them. And I went home because I was a speech therapist at the time that had patience waiting. My sister and law came as intended to pick me tilled in a lease up to take home to their other grandmother. But they never arrived because they died toward the end of the afternoon, about 10 meters from each other on the side of the morning. I'm hesitating about what to write next. There is no common ground between this foreign after. or at least what they have in common strikes me as just as painful to excavate as most deeply buried relics of and for . Yes, I'm hesitant. I'm afraid of failing. I'm afraid that you will believe more readily in their death than in their lives. A few years ago, I still used to drive out into the countryside and bellow at the top of my lungs, but tilled, I was really calling, of course she did not come. At least I had spoken in English. more. Sometimes I meet a little girl who has the same name as her and I speak it. I say, hello Matindu, goodbye Matindu, with a smile. And I think help. On the eve of that Mayday holiday we were not expecting anyone to call and the ringing of the telephone awakens. no feelings in us. We lifted the receiver without curiosity. As light rustling on the line indicated that the call was being made from outside Paris. My sister? No, my new she was on her way to Paris. And unfamiliar man's voice checked that we were indeed the people he was looking for then he told us to hope the line. The next voice was that of her brother and lockrest John who had left with his wife, their baby and our tuberals . We asked him how he wants. He said that he was not good at all, that they had had a very serious car accident. He said, yes, and he told us our two little girls were dead. We thought he was paying a joke on us and then thought no one would play a joke in such court taste. Lordan said, but Christchallan, it's not true. He felt who his knees call him, his children. I asked her news of the others, everyone was fine. Where did we have to go to the hospital at Pellon? I did not know where he was. Christone gave us a few directions, along with whom we hung up. I immediately felt how impossible it was to raise myself to the scale of this event. The terror mounted in me out of all proportioned to my own dimensions. I could not contain it all. I was still this little woman in her little apartment next to a little man in the scene that we were working. The terror targeted us exclusively. We were its only prey. It's only destination, the termless. Who's a giant? do it once. Laurent took me by the wrists and asked me not to scream, he said, to think we're going to have to get over this. A big part of us has stayed there forever. I will tell you what happened next, everything you want to know about what happened next, but at the moment I cannot. Just as then, I am looking for the link between my daughters and that news. We arrived at the door of the hospital, Jean-Pierre not asked where we had to go and pour to reply to the surgery. Then I thought my daughters had been operated on before they died in everything expanded into infinity again. Horrid Wars was difficult to walk. My sister-in-law at the end of the corridor, arms circling round her, her room. My brother-in-law. my sister in law a stranger. They asked us if we would  to see them if we wanted to see our daughters. We would have had to drag me there with a tractor. They asked us if we would  to ring anyone to let them know. I then understand that this horror does not stop us. That we have to tell my mother. No, it's the evening. She's not expecting anyone to lose this evening. Let her sleep on more time. I was right. They need to family wreck. good book. When they asked for it and I reply, yes we've brought it with us, I feel proud for a moment. We are good parents. We thought of everything. A lean and crucial I'm going to spend the night in the hospital near the baby old. All three are kept under observation. We are taken back, in fact, we came to nothing. Right from the first instance death is this nothing. And this is also just that we stayed the night at her house. I... agree readily. She lost a son long ago. At the else house we eat what we are given. Food and sleeping things. It is not so much in words that I'm lacking to tell you all this but in courage. When I realize that I've forgotten something and I have to retrace my steps I say to myself, is it really worth it? Before taking a sleeping pill, we thought that over at the hay there are grandparents where waiting for our daughters, loved ones' parents. Have I told you that they were attending the coronation between Beatrix and Colin? Have I told you that on the 30th of April 1980, this young woman was rising to the throne? And that ever since, this date has been celebrated there as a joyful and versatile event whose secondary effect was the death of the girls. That my father-in-law, the French ambassador. and my mother-in-law were 10 new facilities. That all the embassy staff were busy, so we had found no wonder going fetch the girls at the airport. That resigned only at the very last minute, I had cancelled the places reserved to them on the air France flight. Have I told you that at my mother's house, before they were picked up by their aunt, they had watched the Coronation ceremony on television, as I had done on a corner of my aunt home. Have I told you that seeing my father-in-law's very character? acoustic form and gate. I tell the phone to my mother to ask whether I've run and spotted him. And I can still hear in the background the tilt voice full of discipline. Now I didn't see it. Very, very last time. My mother told me that at the time a lease was turned away from the television observed in her drawing, but that that had not stopped her from affirming energetically, but I did I sign. Since then I have not called until more innings. Where if I have called my eldest daughter it was without the hope that she would reply. It was to feel the vibration in my larynx of those syllables chosen most 25 years old. The arrangement of clear vowels and aquatic consonants which were to mean the first of my children to accompany her all her life to act as her passport and answer her arrival. To be said with only a hint of shine is infinitely in the mouth of the one who would love her to be tree up All the emotions that this girl would want to listen, that she alone would arouse in one young man, a young man who never know her, told lives, and who does not need to love her. After the funeral I went over to my mother to see my aunt and uncle who would soon be returning to Hutzavuang. The concierge came out of her lodge to see me as I went into the building, but till nothing used to go to play with her daughter. She said, you will see. You can get used to anything. It is certainly the most simple, true, brutal, and perceptive thing anyone said to me at the time. You could interpret it either as a message of hope or a question contempt for the nature. You can get used to anything. You can get used to anything. It is very strange this double rhythm that I have with you. I write to you for... my self-to-clarifier period of my life that I've done everything I can't understand, but which has always been out of my grasp. It is said that reality outstrips fiction, but this is something else. The reality remains inaccessible. Since the death of the girls 12 years and 16 days time, I have honestly and constantly tried to unveil this reality with success. Perhaps I've already talked about it. told you, sometimes I believe in them alive, my darling children, darling of girls. These words which are so light and yet some burden some cut through me, and sometimes I believe in your death. On the edge of the motorway, ten or so meters from each other, their legs and dungries, their arms and heads on the side of the motorway. There's never a link between you two. The other rhythm constitutes things I do in my current life as it. nothing had happened. Conversations, laughter, mutual friends, a double rhythm  a double life. You do not know whether they struggle against each other or in rejection. Have I already mentioned Yasser Arafat to you? This is what made me think of him. When at least was born, I found myself battling with a huge hungry baby. The few odd ounces of milk that I was able to spline for 24 hours of her life in hospital would definitely not enough here. and she screamed constantly. With Matilda's crying down the telephone because she thought, lost without me, I quickly lost my patience. I found myself brutally grasping these as cradle, which was on castors, and fiercely pushing it away from my bed so that it was in danger of banging into the far wall, the second of silence, and then the crying started up again. On the third day my mother came to see me. She sat at the end of the bed and chatted. Lie behaviors? We the adults were talking to each other, but I was looking at my daughter who was in the back of me. Drone by her gaze, I leaned over her and rubbed my nose on her. She said, ha, ha. I stared at my mother to reassure myself that I had not dreamed it. I did quit not the breath I would ever. I did the same thing again, and was replied again, third attempt, third exchange. And that was it. She was my child. And I treasure my stupid section. For logistical reasons it was my mother who came with Matilda to pick me up from the hospital. I went down one of big staircasees. At the end of one of the ground floor corridors I saw Matilda in her little green load and coat. She was watching silently motionless, her nose pointing up another staircase. My mother pointed me out to her and Matilda started to walk towards me slowly. I handed a leaves to my mother so that I could lift me tilting to my rightful place in my arms. I can still. to the nearest ounce the pressure of her legs around my waist. She did not say anything, but she slowly and silently felt my face with her hands  a blind group. During this due discovery, this tender and cautious reunion, my mother was smiling, whispering sweet nothings to a means. She had brown hair, olive skin and huge eyes wring with black core and to confront the October weather she was wearing woolen hat which is a bit too big weird seeing falling. skewed sideways over here. She could be Yasar Arafat's daughter, my mother. The other day, the radio announced that Yasar Arafat's plane had disappeared in a sandstorm and would be in desert. A few hours later, although the members of the Vantroj were killed or injured, he himself was found alive and greedy. Every time that a tragic event affects him but spares him, the murder of an advisor all sorts of attempts on his life while an airplane crash. I feel that how began. When I think of the life he leads and life at the reason, when I think of the life expectancy they each had on that October day when my mother tees knew about my daughter. To think that she is dead and he is here. I have been careful. I've never watched the home movies in which my two daughters appear. , I have a listen to their voices on the answering machine tapes that my mother kept. The messages to Granny are at her house, excess home, but I do nothing about it. How many catastrophes have their bends inside and this correspondence with you? Football stadiums collapse. Young motorbiker's kill each other at the 24 hour raising the malls. And here I am with the children in you. And I target my net which is plunged so deep in me. last week I spent a long time looking at a car exactly  the money which my daughter fell asleep from which they were thrown in which leading their parents to go to their grandparents they left parents never to return. I was there looking at the back seat the seat belts that we had not done up the right hand window on which they would both the letters on the number plate confirmed that this window five was from the years my sister-in-law is. They're still on roadness commons. , none left I will know about the deal to ask questions often. Someone left to keep on somewhere from me. After the impact when my sister-in-law managed to bring her carto-hawk, she and her husband turned with her leaf to smile and children, but only their baby was there. Sitting in her little seat, stupified with some fragrance of glass. I'm already told you then, I tell it to myself sometimes. When I was near that, I did not find the other day. I wanted to lie down on the rear seat and make it end of time. In short, back to straight one. I have some work to hand in a lot, but nothing will get done until I've written to you. At first it was the other way around. everything came before writing these names. I used to tell myself, why supper? What's the point of this? Artificial round-table with these long-lost children? I was had something happy with it, didn't you? Now even as I get up, I am carried by the things I want to write to you. I should have gone to see, in that room in the hospital where they provide arms. I knew as soon as they suggested it to me, I knew that by refusing and the sitting precedent for a future week. because I was not worthy of. I do not want to just not. So I did not go to see them dead. They were there and mommy did not come. They were only one or two rooms away. They remained alone. Mommy did not cross the doorway and there nothing other faces as they were at the end. They had the strength to die and I could not match their strength. And nothing they last created, achievement. Wherever they went, they went alone. Together were apart, and I'm inclined to believe it was apart. Ignorant of their own heroism. They went to the places dictated by their violent trajectory at more than 100 kilometers per hour. And with a safety period. I stayed on my chair, make a lump. And since then, people have not stopped congratulating me for more courage as I'm moving. To such an extent that many friends, including you, hesitated before talking to us about the difficulties in hardships they were facing. They did not seem worthy in comparison. We were wrong to nice sat in the throne on a pedestal, coisted thereby the annihilation of our two girls. But we still knew what real life was,  a weather map of constant change in skies and we needed people to tell us about it, because the air was thin, perhaps as thin. This dance that I battle against is to threaten suicide. To keep those around you on teneter hooks because you claim you're going to die, watch out, I'm going to kill myself. I'm not going to slip and make a fuss with their moves, and they're either half running all over the place trying to stop them. I'm going to kill myself, watch out, watch out. Oh no, that is not how you do it. I will explain to these maniacs how we're tilting the leaves managed to die. If I can, that is. because they did the whole thing by themselves. And when the adults came to their senses and began to realize that they were no longer in the car, not even under the front seats where they looked once they realised that they were safe and empty. When they had to resign themselves to getting out of the car to look for them, they had to be found wherever they might be. When it was done and they had been found, dozens of meters from the car and dozens of meters apart, they had actually already gone. Without a word, to a place that no man can see. All of this brings me back to that moment of weakness on my chair when, even though two children, my two children, two very young children, had known how to die, and were waiting to be presented to me one last time in their truthfulness. I had not even gone news few meters long corridor that separated them from me. I had known how to die. There has been nothing glorious about the way I did my life. I loved living in all of my asthma. I loved the dead for their tamar影. There's nothing in between. Our children now, Elvira and Gautier, but I've asked us a hundred times whether they would have been born or thirsty. and the sisters had not died. I really hope so, but I just cannot see. The girls death allowed me to be pregnant again, which I wanted to have other children who didn't want to get in. Even so, at the square with the children, I was not  other mothers, sitting on the bench, or on the side of the sand pit. I would watch my elderly and making my pies, and I would  go to a satan who's biscuit. If another woman wanted to talk to me, I had on two options. A bright massage, which devastated me. Yes, my name is already 3.5 which is still frightened to the soft. Can't believe your little scrap of brave up the top flag. Or a truth that was socially unacceptable. These are my younger two children. The elder ones died for me. I would always be out of place. Working class immigrants, the self-taught cranks, the handicap, the unemployed, and siblings than veterans. I'm also a student student against President Obama earlier that Kr столoy was one of the most grubing parents among all Americans and individuals who had struggled with the LGBTQ. OK, so for sure beyond all . her people. They have at least one thing in common. They have to make her Canadian efforts to hold normal, banal, bounce, conversation. They can think of only one thing. The moment only my teacher does a sentence about them is fortunate. 13 years have passed and I still cannot last half day without a broken man. I'll be your host card from a friend and I'll send that replacement. I was having a see-stop. In my drowsy state I could hear the voice of my 12-year-old daughter talking to the father, respecting another seat. I'm going to have to tell Goethe I aren't hungry. He was playing with his cousin. Goethe I does not want to hear about anything to do with death. So when I hear told him he hit his feelings. and hardly broke off in this game. And in fear was left alone, this news which she had just learned from one of those holiday cards that should never give in that sort of news. And it's going on, I asked, pretending to have heard nothing, feeling sure that I'll be able to talk to them every single song. She joined me on the bed, buried herself against me, sighed and then cried. She had been telling me about this friend's illness since the beginning of the school I knew that. Lauren came to school sporadically that she changed physically, that her mother who's always cheerful came to pick her up from school with her two younger children, asking more that a ship forgot in anything in the locker, as she would to a child who still has 10 or 15 years of school in head of the room. And that was it, Lauren sank into a coma. Elver had told me about that too, but now as she cried, she realized she had never imagined that Lauren would actually die. And this death, this end. to everything, this earthly truth which meant that the child would have been told not to forget anything in locker, would not begin the next academic year in three weeks' time. This was so harsh and so invincible that Elvier had only her tears to nink the two realities, that of a life yesterday, which was conveyed even in a state of coma, and death, which was eternal right from the first moment. Now even as she struggled with the sharp pain. She already knew that soon very soon this pain was softened. And despite her sorbs, her shut-on-go-frame, the puff-a-red face, she was already missing purity of this revolt before it had even begun to fade. And she refused to accept that the sorrow would become integrated into my life. When I tell my children about this one day, they won't understand how horrible it was she took. The name. Maybe even tomorrow there were more than a million people who didn't think about it. This idea of redoubled her anger, far from hoping to suffer less, she never wanted the questions that they had to do. This was the only acceptable response to her disappearance every part of her refused to decide. As I listened to her, I loved her for having all reliance to do everything. I thought of these letters in which. So many years later, I try to discover exactly what has become of all of this thing. Genevieve Durden since book is called The Disappearance, it's almost by noise. Exerpt for red by actress simplicity, Jones. Coming up, more people try to make sense. senseless, couldn't story by David's dearest. In a minute, I will be waiting for your national, when I promise you, it's a genius. This American life, I'm Eric Glass. Each is going to program a course which is something you're a variety of different kinds of clothes. Today, in the way to the news at the World Trade Center, and we're being in stories about people trying to make sense of loss and tragedy. In each of our stories today, somebody contemplates the death, and this his book. is close to him. And then tries to surround the idea of that death, words and stories. Hoping that that might give some comfort. We have arrived at a two-over program to look for the union label. In this act, two people, father and daughter, we're here from the starting to pose a story about death or anybody is gone. Well, it simply began by sitting in the kitchen of my home. the Boston Globe and looked out and they beautiful fall day looking out at a maple tree in front of my yard and suddenly the curtailed me that I should write my obituary or begin working no special reason. It must have been probably over the Christmas holidays probably last year and you were visiting your visiting appearance house. My parents  around that time and I was looking at the I was on the telephone and I was just looking for a pad of paper to write something down. And I just noticed on a pad of a yellow legal pad, my father had started writing his obituary. But it wasn't labeled obituary. No. No. It just, , it said born in 1917 to, , Albany and it just was incredibly straightforward and standard. In it. And I just couldn't believe it. I didn't actually have an emotional response to the obituary part at all. I was just sort of, I guess I was mused in a way because he is such an interesting person. And the book, , the writing was, it was just sort of the most basic details about his family and, , it didn't really say anything about him. No, there's he's a more interesting person than the writing itself. Right. And I, I don't know. And I didn't really process the thought. But I just want straight to him and I said, Dad, my God. So boring, I said you've lived a much more interesting life than this and he said, well, this is going to help me write it, you're a writer. Help me write it and all he knew was what the headline should be. That was sort of the one very clear thing that he knew. And then what should the headline be? They had the, , his name, I'm named after him, you'd say Adrian, LeBlanc, I'm a product of the working class. That was what he saw. That's what makes me very important. When I say the working class, I'm talking about workers. It's what my history from the first factory job, first learning what a union was, and then beginning a committee man and president of local unions that I, wherever I work. From that on, gravitate to becoming a full-time field representative. I tend to take positions. I do this. everyday in my life and I think that the obituary was  saying there are still union guys around you following yeah that's clear but that was pretty much it's  saying look  82 years later from 16 to 82  there are still guys who are making a pitch and so we sit down  I'm pretty sure that birthday was set down. I opened my portable computer and  and I said okay and he said so how do we do this? What do we do? And I said well I just need you to tell me about your life. I've actually tried to do this my dad before not in the context of the obituary but  in those moments where I felt oh I need to learn about my family history but he was not very responsive. He'd be very vague but some for some reason when he was thinking of his life in terms of of an obituary, a lot of details came out that I don't feel I could have, well I was not able to get when I was trying to just have straight conversations with him about his biography, , his dart quality. I was wondering if it was an enjoyable process for you. Talking to your dart. Yes. Yes. Yes. She's going to, I find her to be a surgeon. a prober and with good instincts and caring. So I don't know it was just interesting and it came very easily. I learned so much about him. Since it was in a bitch where you were living, did the two of you talk about his dad? No. That's something that I think. I don't know, it's funny. In preparing for this, , several of my friends were asking me about it and it just sort of shocked me a little bit that they were thinking about it in that way and then of course I realized it is no bituary. I wonder if he understands it or the other way that his folks these considered it really as best. I think he must and I think over the years he's known how anxious my- I've been about him dying. So I think he often tries in his way to help us cope with it. He doesn't seem nervous for a fight. So I don't know. When I leave, when I go to visit, I find leading my parents sometimes quite difficult because they are older and I'm very busy and I don't get back as often as I'd  to. And I think he knows how hard it is. say goodbye and he'll say  he'll say I'm always with you and I'll always be with you that kind of thing I wonder if this whole process you think you're doing it for him in a way but maybe it's for you he's doing this off for you right I believe it's very possible That's very possible. Which is probably why he was a good union organizer. Because I'm feeling  I'm helping him. Do you have to do something? He was good at what he did. It's one of the reasons that you agreed to talk to your daughter about the obituary and work with her in the obituary is to help her prepare for the thought that you might be a good union organizer. , it could be at hand. I haven't stayed with that thought, but , it could very well be, I would maybe you're flowing in. I think that thought is crossed my mind, but I have stayed with. I haven't stayed with. I haven't stayed, but you could be partially right. , is there a- way to ever, I'm not sure I would want it to be easier, but I wonder if it's possible, , it's a possible to even know what that could be . You're saying that no matter how we try to bear with the death of somebody's subconscious. The really is nothing we can do, we can think better at all in one. Yeah, I definitely feel that with it. I mean, because obviously I've been working on an obituary, not really thinking at all, but my- my father dying. , not thinking that it's about death. I'm just thinking that it's about talking to my father. Then I have all the time to sort of figure this out. I don't know. It's part of my relationship with him will be what happens when it's over, when it's physically gone. I mean, my brother-in-law passed away and he was quite sick before he died. And he was, , coma, right up, , to the moment that he actually did die. And there was such a vast difference between him. Even though he wasn't available as the person we'd known, his physical life was so immense. And when it was gone, it was the loss of it was just huge, , it was huge. And it happened in just a minute. And I just was so shocked by that because I was so ready for him to die. And I knew that he was going to die. He wasn't really with us anymore and it was just, , and I was glad that I was able to at least understand how little I actually knew about it. So how far are the two of you on the Obed every Sunday? No, no. I haven't actually, , I can't figure out how to write it except in the past tense and it just seems. completely bizarre. To speak of him in that way. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. So I understand she hasn't finished writing it. No, we haven't completed it. No. You've actually taken too long, getting this done. Do you  things she's taking too long? Yeah. No. This surgeon feels  there's no great rush. But I know her. Well, why you have to finish it. You have to finish it. I'm not going anywhere. I'm still bowling on fries with a senior citizens. Adrian LePlanck and his daughter, also named Adrian LePlanck. The way you wear your hat, the way you sit beyond you. The memory of all that. No, no, they can't take that away from me. Hectories, ashes. When somebody dies, we can be haunted, but... thought of them. And we can also be hunted by the way that we acted, ourselves, toward them. This next story is a story of both kinds of hunting. Several years ago, three weeks before his sister, Lisa's wedding, David Sedaris got a phone call from his mom that come to rally with her, she had gone cancer. She was a lifelong, unrepentant smoking. My sister, Amy, was with me when my mother called. We passed the phone back and forth across my colony in New York, and then spent the rest of the evening. in bed, trying to convince each other that our mother would get better but never quite believing. I heard of people who would survive the cancer, but most of them claimed to get through it with the aid of whole grains and spiritual publications that encouraged them to sit quietly on low disposition. They envisioned their tumors and tried to reason more. Our mother was not the type to greet the dawn, cooked with oats and barley. She didn't reason, she threatened. And if that didn't work, she'd tell. those to ignore the problem. We couldn't picture her joining a support group or cutting through the mall in a warm-up suit. 62 years old, and none of us had ever seen her in a pair of slabs. I'm not certain why, but it seemed to me that a person needed a pair of pants in order to feet-cancer. Just as important, they needed a plan. They needed to accept the idea of a new, different future, free of crowded ass trades in five gallon jugs of wine, scotch. They needed a... believe that such a life might be worth living. I didn't know that I'd be able to embrace such an unruly warning future, but I hope that she caught. If she'd had it her way, it would have never known about the cancer. It was our father's idea to tell us and she had bought it, agreeing only when he threatened to tell us himself. I'm not there worried that once we found out, we would... her differently, delicately. We might feel obliged to compliment her cooking, math, and all her jokes, thinking always of the tumor she was trying so hard to forget. And that is exactly what we did. The knowledge of her illness forced everything into the spotlight and demanded to be memorable. We were no longer calling our mother. Now we were picking up the telephone to call our mother with cancer. We realized that any conversation might has been a big challenge. last, and because of that, we wanted to say something important. What could one say that had no already been printed on millions of breeding cards healing balloons? I love you, I said at the end of one of our late night phone calls . I am going to pretend that I didn't hear that, she said. I heard a match strike in the background, the tank would revise cubes and erase glass, and then she happened. I had never said such a thing to my mother, and if I had it to do over again, I would probably take it back. It was clear to say such a thing to someone unless you were trying to talk them out of money or into bed. Our mother had taught us this when we were no taller than ponykicks. I had known people who said such things to their parents. I love you, but are going waste translate? mean I'd love getting off the phone with you. We gathered together for the wedding which took place on Chris Clear October afternoon. I took my mother's arm and later to a bench beyond the range of the other guests. The thin mountain air made it difficult for her to breathe and she moved slowly. pausing her for a few moments. The families had taken a walk to a nearby gland and sat in the shade, eating sausage biscuits and speaking to one another well-known strangers. The sausage is good, she said. It's flavourful but not too greasy. Not too greasy at all. Still though, it is a dry. Neither are the biscuits she said. They're light and crisp. Very buttery. Very, these are some very buttery biscuits. They're flaky, but not too flaky. Not too flaky at all. She said, We watched the path awkwardly waiting for someone to release us from the torture of our stiff and meaningless conversation. I'd always been afraid of sick people and so at my mother. I think it was afforded to the darkness. Sick people reminded us not of what we had. But... of what we lack. Everything we said sound petty and insignificant, are complaints pale than the face of theirs, and without our complaints there was nothing to say. My mother and I have been fine over the telephone, but now face to face the rules have changed. If she were to complain she was being seen as a set complainer, the worst kind of all. If I would do it, I might come off sounding even more selfish than I actually was. This sudden turn of of vans had robbed us of our common language, leaving us to exchange the same innocuous pleasantries we had always made fun of. I wanted to stop it and so I think did she, but neither of us knew how. After the gifts had been opened, we returned to our rooms at the Eucana lodge. We reservations having been made by my father. We look at them. windows, has to freeway into the distance, squinting at the charming hotels, hotled at the base of other iron-house. This would be the last time our family was all together. It's so rare when one knowingly does something for the last time. The last time you take a bath, the last time you have sacks or trim your toenails. If you knew you'd never do it again, it might be nice to really make a show up. This would be it as far as my family was concerned. me off that our final meeting would take place in such a sorry excuse for our hotel. What more do you want out of our hotel? He shouted stepping out under the patio and his underpants. It's clean, they've got a couple of snack machines in the lobby, the TV's working as near the interstate. Who cares if you don't  the damn wallpaper? what your problem is, don't you? We're spoiled. We shouted in you, Risen. My parents retired to the realm and the rest of his height to a nearby cemetery. A once ideal spot now recorded an excellent view of the newly built pizza. Who the years our mother had repeatedly voiced desire to be queen. We would drive past a small forest fire or observe the pillars of smoke rising from a neighbor's chimney, and she would crush her cigarette saying, that's what I want right there. Do whatever you  with your inines. Sprinkle them into the ash trays of a fine hotel, give them to smart-ass children for Christmas, hand them over to the Catholics to rub into their foreheads, just make sure I'm green-handed. Oh, Sharon, my father. would growl. You don't know what you want. He'd say it is though he himself had been cremated several times in the past, but it finally wise-dought and accepted burial as the only sensible option. We laid our economy large bedspreads over the dewy grass of the cemetery, smokey joints and try to imagine a light. without our mother. If there was a heaven, we probably shouldn't expect to find your there. Neither did she deserve to roam the fiery tarp hits of hell, surrounded for all eternity by the same sh**-heads who brought his strip moss and theme must rise. There must exist some middle ground, a place where one was tortured on a daily basis, but still allowed a few moments of pleasure, taken wherever they could find. That place seemed to be wiling with your alina. So why? the big fuss, why couldn't she just stay where she was and not have kids? Ever since arriving at the motor lodge, we gone back and forth from one room to another, holding secret meetings and exchanging private bits of information. We hope that by preparing ourselves for the worst, we might be able to endure the inevitable with some degree of courage, grace. Anything we forecasted was puny compared to the future that awaited us. You can't break it. face yourself for famine if you've never known hunger. It is foolish even to try. The most you can do is eat up while you still can. Scuffing yourself, shoveling it in with both hands and making clean the plates. We calling every course and vivid detail. I mother was back in her room in very much alive. Probably watching a detective program on television. Maybe that was her light in the window. Her figure stepping out into the patio delight is cigarette. We told ourselves she probably wanted to be left alone. That's how Stone could be one. We think of this later, each in our own separate way. I myself tended well on the stupidity of pacing and cemetery, while she sat, frightened and alone, staring at the temperature cigarette, and envisioning herself, clearly now, in ashes.
