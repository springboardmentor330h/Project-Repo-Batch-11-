  "text": "Alex was seven. He had a teddy bear named Tony. Tony had been forever. Tony was with him back and he had also to surgery and if he was sure if he was going to come through. But Alex did pull through and afterwards the nerves of the family were still jangling. Alex continued to carry around for a year, secret club. When he was 70 took Tony with him to Disneyland. And when the family got back home to San Francisco from Disneyland. Alex's parents unpack the bags. And we'll be talking. And Tony was not there. Alex's dead John tells the story. So Alex was in the room and we told him it appears that Tony isn't here. And it took him about a minute to really realize that Tony was gone. At point he said two things. First thing is he said he couldn't imagine life without Tony. And the other is, he said, I feel  I've lost my spirit. At that point, , what's apparent to do? , what do you do? So they call it hotel and the hotel says over the phone, they have not found this teddy bear. And so John flew down there the next morning, tried to be a good dad, rented a car, retraced the family's path, made his way to the hotel. After waiting for a few minutes, I'll be... security guards. And said, well, Mr. Holtsman, we have bad news for you. what happens there? Yeah. They explained, sir. A maid had seen the bear, apparently, in the garbage. And that he conferred away. And so my immediate reaction was, well, that's great. That's not bad. Because that's good news. So, at least we know where he is. He said, well, no, you got to see the problem. Linear rounds back. There was this huge seal dumpster after literally the size of the semi-trail. 25, 30 feet long. They looked at it and there was literally no way into the dumpster. John started to spare and I started asking, well, when is the next garbage? Just browse away from you. And just as we were having this discussion, the truck arrives to pick up this giant dumpster, a day roll. And, , this is kind of an amazing thing because if I got in there 15 minutes later, 20 minutes later, the garbage truck will be gone. The squad of hotel employees was deployed, the squad with John and the garbage truck to the recycling plan to search for the teddy bear. Hello? There are only two possible attitudes that adults would have towards this particular mission. One, they'll be into it, or two, they would think it jumped enough. And incredibly, none of them thought that he was a knight. But why? Because almost all of them are parents. And at some point or another, almost all of them had been in the same voice similar situation. I mean, you couldn't be a parent without having to deal with it. your kids deal with loss. And it's so... Oh. And yeah, I mean, I think everybody rallied to exactly that. To cause. It's just because I think that a lot of parents get to get to points at different points at different points in the child's lives, where they want to intervene and they feel  they will not allow fate. To hurt their child. Absolutely. and they will simply do whatever they can to stop fate. There's no question. And if you've ever had a child in a normal size, it means a lot in a way to be able to protect your kids. From that kind of thing. Well, on this Father's Day, we bring you stories that's fine. Take their kids. And kids trying to protect their dad from the BBC Chicago and public radio international this American life in my regards. Today on our program, the protection racket that is parenthood are program today in 3 acts at 1, heading to Tuesday at the dump, the story of a man, the smart toy bear, and tens of thousands of pounds of Saudi garbage, back to trip down memory lane. A syntax is farther on one last road trip, to drive this dad's feeling memory of his own life. 3, Age of Enchantment. By the Lawrence Westerner and his daughter Sarah, talk about something that he did, intending to be kind, intending to protect her from disappointment, that inadvertently broke her heart. And, as she said the day for two of them, stay with us. Padding can stay at the dump. So John Hotsman and the hotel employees, part of the garbage truck that's hauling dumpster away, in his car, for constrips, and at this point essentially, this story becomes the movie saving private Ryan, and  why don't have some music in movie just to set the right Arive up in of friend amo somewhere in setting up on you, it's a little bare-name tone, these four recruits can get them out. So it's a stage that we want to make. So we're in the car and there is this kind of silence. I made a deal with everybody in the car. I offered each of them a hundred dollars for the person who found the bear. We were in a kind of plotting strategy. Well, I can't open this dumpster. How are we going to find the bear? Where is he going to be in dumpster? How many days of garbage is this? there. And so we finally arrived at the recited. And first of all, scope of the display. It's not at all. I expected to be just a garbage now. But instead, I get it's what I imagined to be essentially a modern recycled plan. It's huge caterpillar trailers, tractors running around plant. And it's the center of this huge steel. full floor, scope, scale, and sports is just a really awesome thing. It's  acres, whatever. Yeah, it's just huge. Music Music It takes a long, long time to talk the way into the plant. The enter, all work at the recycling center has to stop. But, incredible. Finally, they're about it under one condition. We would have 15 minutes. 2 to search this pile. But that's all we can have. Which, , put a lot of pressure on us. Although I'm not sure we understood how much pressure would put on us until they dumped the garbage out of the trailer. So they dumped the garbage out of the trailer. And even though the trailer was large, I guess I kind of underestimated how much garbage can go to hell with that size. Ah, So they dump this out on floor and of course it spread out. So it occupies this massive space on floor. This full of this brown sludge liquid. And just tens of thousands of plastic bags floating essentially. Number floating. Losing this. This soggy, soggy mess. And I took one look at this pile and my heart truly is saying. People going through these realistic trucks. Think over something. So I had said to close up this stockboys What is the biggest damage that I did here. So I came up with something very close. I just thought, I mean, I don't even know where to go. A number of the people who came with me kind of jumped in immediately started with me. Trying to find their. And so after 30 seconds or so I'm going to take on. So I'm going to draw a new dancing. Smile on with. Watching us do it, the Scarbageman, the folks who were running recycling plants, at least four or five of them put on their gloves, started doing the same thing with us. So at this point, they were, who made me hate our nine of us, pulling the cart man's friend looking fit in his pair. Seven or eight minutes into it. I'm really... I just despair, I'm not a good boy. I couldn't believe in how much fun I've just seen that it all worked out, but I didn't see how much I just just to be. And I remember saying to myself, Tony, if you're here, you're really just going to have to have a peer on the surface because you're just not there. The only way this is going to happen is, , if you kind of make yourself appear. And the next thing I knew, I was holding back. Put it in with Amy. You mean you think of a plastic bag? I'm just a plastic bag. And there he was. And he was in a plastic bag, so he was completely dry. I'm scared. How did it explain that? Oh, I know. , I'm a rationalist. I'm not religious. , particularly, I'm not really spiritual anyway. Labor and negotiator, I don't want to respond. I think what's, , I think it's strange to me is not just the way I found them, but we had eight or nine people. And why was I the one? Because you were touched by an angel that wanted to save you a hundred dollars. Yeah John Hall Smith isn't attorney and San Francisco the hotel That deployed its forces to get the bear back. I feel if we should give them credit what's say their name on the air It's the Sheraton and on But One last note here isn't thing about being father being caring John gets the bear. He's also quite his deity. He could get him on the drive back to hotel and there he caused the sun to get him. He was really, really happy but there was also a kind of a corsage response to the thing that just got good. Well, I had to go to the bear. He doesn't quite understand it for the heroic gesture that it is. I think that's true. He's , oh yeah, dad went down. He got the bear. The theme to star wars is not playing in his head. I too, trip down memory lane. Joe Mario is a photographer who had been in New York City. In the 1970s, his parents moved to Florida, Joe would visit for a few days at a time. His time passed, his father hired fellow Paul Simmers. I was a ... salesman for the years, the few years as a comic and brought the life with that. He was a boxer, one as weight class and first Golden Gloves competition. An entity at Alzheimer's, the doctor said that he should stay inside, where do I assume you're Asian? Son Joke, what would you try for a brief time? Something different. We're going to have one last adventure with his father, one last road trip, for the Alzheimer's met in the hospital to have more adventures. So also hope that maybe being on the road, visiting places that he'd been doing. Back to the old neighborhood one more time might spark some memories that had been gone for his death, but it had been long, long, and damaged. It was a gift to his death. So they got a camera, they went on a three-week trip, driving from Fort Waterdale back to New York City. Joe Mario, it's his son Sasha, film Galazza's trip. You actually hear his voice on eight a few times in the split. When they said that on the trip, Sasha was 27, Joe was 57. Hi, ladies. What are you doing with ocean misses? Well, I'm from Joe, I don't remember. That's not that goes ocean. That goes mountains. Yeah, this is an ocean. huh, which one? , is it the Pacific or the Atlantic? I'll take it as Pacific. You're wrong. Yeah, wrong. So which one is it? and he is the mission of the mission. Right. The mission for Simo. The mission for Simo. I am not the mission of the Simo. Why do you ask me to write in the money or crush it  that? You born? One or two? One, I'm one or nine, two or seven. Yes.

He said, take the biggest guy down. And that was his attitude. He wouldn't stop run away for many. On Mars and every block he lived on, he was considered the mayor of the block. Any time there was a dispute that had to be settled, so it actually come and ask him, what do you think of it? Or if there were strangers coming through the neighborhood, and he needed to be told to get out of this. Don't get it.

Is it hard to see? Honestly, it's... It said, I have a feeling of sadness. I also have a feeling of acceptance. We've been apart for 20 years. Can this, in the mutual prime of our lives, I was raising my children. He was a great group. We wanted together. And so on. I guess I'm just accepting of where he is. And we had been together. 20 years and had seen that the client had been relating to him emotionally lovingly all that time I might be the deeper sadness. But even though he's my father, the distance that we've made a car all these years has some kind of a buffering there. So this is the guy that I know now. We have a much closer relationship where we see each other, talk to each each other and haveás the more.. There's no one from here at the bottom, you're at your hero, there's a sweet, that must be hard to see. You're here for, let me listen to you. You're here. You're trying to do it here. That's so far away, I can't relate to the sadness. of that. I mean, I love him in the mechanical way, so I love his parents. And we feel  I care for him, I kind of re- I guess I re-know or re-birth of feeling in this period. I think when I have to show how I rub him down, actually feel his head in my hands, it's been many years since I... had that kind of contact with my father. And it was a little strange, first. I thought, it's  to rub this other person's body, touch this other person's body. It's  death threats. And then it releases my father. And he's, he's in need. He can't take care of himself. All this way. Huh? Okay, here's the problem. Hold on, okay, here comes the show. Show, my show. Do  who I am? Who? Let me know how come my mom's phone. Don't get mad at me. Don't get mad at me. Very important because I've been trapped. I think my father's hand. classic marriage of his generation. He loved my mother. She was beautiful and hot tempered and exciting person to be with. But he wanted something for her and then he didn't know how to get. She couldn't get and that was a kind of mother love that he himself hadn't experienced. Yes, I'm okay. Oh, and that had a good time. Are you having a good time? Who are you really? I'm telling you, how much you'd be healthy and sure. And shmile, shall you? , his mother had been bedridden after his birth, and then she died, so he never really knew her. That's the deepest move in his memory, which is, I think, unrequited long. Don't be down the journey, it's going to be right now. Now I'm gonna be the first one of your worst tests. And I will be back maybe through a month or two. Oh, it's done. Would you go with me the next trip? Would you go with me the next trip? Okay. All right, take care of your head. Be careful with it. Be careful. And I think that's on my point of view now. that if he had really just loved my mother without demanding something from all needing something from her which was a child of me that she probably would have just loved him back for the time warm funny man that he was but because there was something that he was demanding she couldn't get into a kind of reverse logic of a foolish quarrel. She made about something, but maybe I didn't do nothing. Why is she new? She made it. She sounded very, very bad. It's how much she didn't care. She probably was hearing a lot. She was just why she was doing a good thing. I'm waiting for her to be there. There'd be here. Which house is it? Here, I'm on. And it's a my love that I'm having when I , and I would love to do love to be involved with. The idea is that I always have to include, mom. Throughout the truth, he asked for something. Everything. We sent it as long, thinking that she should have been in the car next to me. Got it! You need to sell your food. You have to sell your food. Look at me. I know it's right here. Nothing. I told you to sell your old bundle up. See, it's up. That was a happy gift. You have to sell it. You have to sell it. I know it's right here. She may see her. She's nice. I know she's not in a trunk. You wouldn't do that though. I'm not in a... when it comes to this show, I'm at the smartest, the cutest in this world. If my mommy, from my mommy, don't shut up and then don't come down the five minutes I want to know where she is. This is my wife. Get all the better's in the trunk. What is this right here? It was a time we would drive in winter and slide in the foliage and snow. and she was sitting right next to the green door for the meeting saying, where's mom? Who's sitting next to? He looked over, his presidency in excellence. I'm just saying, that's not selling. When my father was in jail, he was the one from dancing, a path of natural conflict. I guess Charlie Chaplin was the rage, just to think I would say something, didn't Chaplin didn't think it was, and my father, he became the Chaplin in the entertainment. He would have that acting, he said to him, wrote a report on the subject. I've been trying to fit in myself to all the years. with the joking, I was trying to be a chaplain. I didn't know if I was doing that right or wrong, but I saw that little guy, they'd even done picks up not everybody give me kick in the ears. That was what I used to see. That is what I didn't want to happen to me. What's the thing to write about Troy Chaplin? Me, who wanted to. Troy Chaplin. He's here as he was a giant, and he's in the height, below the magic TV. the Zomgai, very writing all the wrongs, helping others as he pays for him. We've had a mother tapal head. If you remember that there, in our just community, it takes the Sikrukha to do the pariyah or the creation of no money or no nothing. And if it goes, then the society cannot be  this. Shakes also live in red chavadan. And that means what I've got. The goodness, the goodness. And they not everybody wants to... Sit aside. Put those out of sit aside, put your iron on him, and he will do the same with them. All the ways. It is beautiful. One day. Again sit with if possible. Anyways, welcome. It is over! This time, you can sit farewell. Thank you for watching my video, and don't forget to subscribe and support watching Anthony and most of them find these arms. Even though he was easily loved by taking from God, these were his qualities, and that he was in fact loved by people. Faded from his memory, and at the end of his life, he remembers a few of him painfully. So if he's another child, and he was not loved in me, he wanted me. It's amazing that with the merciless of all of us, cloudy everything that something is in prime. It's something we really love child. Stayed with him. When anybody was showin' little bit something to me that I was accepted and they were told to me that they had me at the head over Patricia's room. I'm home. I love them, everybody. I love them, everybody. It was not resourmed. Nobody, it made me, nobody knew me. Nobody saw me, but I was there. It's very day, I'm the same thing, I have poor mommy. I have her, it's just... See me, she doesn't see me. Rebois, reals. I love when you were the strong man in the neighborhood. I love when you were the captain figure in the comic. I love the way you draw from the core. You are such a great draw. I love the way you talk to people. You can talk to the big guys with a little guy, and you made them all the same. I used to think of you as the great supervisor. You could take a guy who was a doctor or a principal or a school or a business man, and you can take another guy who was just... It's an ordinary worker and you treat them the same. And you would bring them all to the same level and that would be the level of laughter. You still have it. You still have a puppet. That's right. Joe Myowitz is father of high sunsasha. In the years since they recorded that footage, highest died. Joe and Sasha cut their footage into a film. It's called Hop, here at them, maybe I showed a front line. This September Joe was putting out a book called After Map. This large format photos from ground zero site in New York City. Coming up in dead, try too hard. Let's in a minute. Let's talk about the radio. I'll be getting into the national. we are not looking. This is American Lyre Comer class. Each week in a program of course it uses a theme and variety of writers from the street tackle that theme. Today's program, Father's Day, the Green U-Stories kids trying to care for and protect the dads and dads trying to protect and care for the kids. We arrived at a three of our show at three each in the channel. Our intv, is an author and journalist. He used to write a lot from the Yorker magazine. The story is about his attempt to protect his daughters. Sarah from this appointment and through her and how with the best of intentions all of this one arrived, I'm led to an odd breech of trust between father and child. He and Sarah went into a studio in New York City to tell us this story that the time Sarah was 11 years old. The story began simply now. She would get into very active conversations with the characters in the books while we were reading. So for example when we were reading Little House in the prairie. there would be these moments where she would interrupt my reading and say, wait a second, I want to talk to Indian and we'd have to go look at the picture of Indian and she said, Indian, Indian, in a few pages you're going to meet Laura. But you've got to be understand, I know she's taking your lab, but it's not her fault she's just to get, now let me talk to Laura and we go back and we talk to Laura. And in these things, I would take on the role of Indian, and I'd say, who's that talking so forth? And we would have these incredibly elaborate conversations. Do you remember that there? Yes. Well, this sort of thing would. go out all the time and later point we began reading the barwares series the series of wonderful books by Mary Mowl. Martin. Martin. Five Mary Norton. That's right. And well, should Sarah describe what the book is about? I'm sure Sarah explain with the barwares. Well, the barwares is about these little people who are, I think, , four inches tall and they live under the floor board in the house. And... what they do is they take things from people, little things that they can use around their house. So what kinds of things do they take? Well, they take pocket watches and stamps,  pictures on the wall. And part of the point about borrowers is they're not allowed. Are they allowed to talk to people? Yeah. Well, because they think that people can really hurt them because according to the book, it's happened before. Right? So anyway, we were reading this book. And one day I came home and Sarah was incredibly excited. Her face was just glowing. And we won't believe it. We have powers here in our own house. My memory is that you were on the same level. But my memory was that she went to a particular place in the basement. She pointed at her little asshole in the bathroom. And the floor and she said, I was coming down the stairs. After I was one of them standing. wife there, little girl, and she was wearing a pink tap of skirt. And high-froes, and she froze, and looked at each other. And I knew I wasn't supposed to talk to her or the she shouldn't go to me, but we just looked into her there after about 30 seconds, and he kind of waved her hand just slightly and she ran away. And it was right there, and Sarah took me to the place where it was. And Sarah, let me just ask you, what do you remember of these? Well, I remember having seen what you see. It's your strange to say this. because , it's her feel, I feel  I'm betraying the barwars, but I still believe in them. And , if I ever actually got to meet when I'd never tell anyone. And I do remember having seen something. And it wasn't going for three seconds. It was  for me 10 seconds. And then it ran away. And even now when you think about it, you can picture. You can actually see. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't, I didn't imagine. It was, it was definitely there. And it was a little bit. girl? Yeah, I think. Okay. And then over the next few days Sarah began leading things for this bar war. And the first thing in the morning she wouldn't raise downstairs to see whether she picked up. Do you remember what kind of things you left? I left  sometimes I'd leave  two pigs or a piece of food. What are these two pigs for? I'm just  to dig with and go ahead. Have an all-purpose tool. Yeah. Yeah. Walking stiff. Yeah. Anyway, such she would leave these things there and she would be so disappointed and disappointment, version on desolation that they worked picked up. She had long conversations. Why aren't they taking off? They know that I'm doing them and I would try to explain. I mean, I don't want to say her nerves or something. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. I figured this would happen, but at the same point, this one. off for a week. I don't know why I did it because it's again a cascade consequence but one night I picked up the stuff and put it in my pocket and the next morning he came bounding up the stairs. Daddy won't believe what their armars just  I said they took the stuff they took the stuff and she was transported with the light and I figured that would be the under it. What it won. What will happen? What happened next? I started writing to them. I started writing letters. Okay, let's wanted to learn to ask you to pull out one of those letters and I see what you write first. Okay. Now you were six at the time, right? Seven. Seven. Dear borrowers, I have seen you, but I want to meet you. If I do, I will not tell anyone without your permission. A greater and then this is borrowers. Well, then what? What? Just one head. So what happened is that that note, I don't know if you little yellow posted, lay by the whole for several days, and for several morning Sarah would be completely devastated that, and had not been answered. So I went through several days, I'm not quite knowing what to do because she was going to be more and more sad about this and more concerned. And so then I figured well, , you're going to be fine. And I think I've got this paper, right? Let's take a cabe back. I did. Do you have the bills? Yeah, it's almost the same piece of paper. Okay, so, so... Dear Sarah, gosh, this is strange. Who are you? How do  about borrowers? I don't know human beings ever knew about this. My dad says it's too dangerous for borrowers to meet a human being. But, and he even says, I mustn't write you. But maybe at least I can write. Will you write back? I hope so. I hope you put a secret from my dad. And, and a belly. PS, I am 11. How about you? And so you got this you remember getting the southern? Who? You remember that morning what you said? What do you feel with this terrorist? No. What did she say to you? Oh she was just saying. They are. I told you I told you and she answered she answered. She wants me to write back. She was over the move. And she wrote back immediately. Yes. So when did you conceive of your borrowers as being descendents of the borrowers in the book? Well it was unclear. it was a possibility. and I'm a serrity, gradually find out more. So there are large part of the correspondence and serrity we're achieving logical work on the fact of what he did. It has to be all kinds of questions. Yeah, I would ask , what was your grandmother's name and it turned out, that her grandmother was R.E. I mean, she says that she calls her that T, as an epithon, because in the book, did that as pawn? And then she calls her mom, Hermit. because in the book, the mother is homily. How long did the letter script back and forth? How many letters were there? I think there were over 17. Did I insert counting the letter? And during this time, were you frightened about where this is going to leave that it's some point you would get? Well, it was getting strange. And actually, it's going to nerve-wracking. And I would do things  I kept on figuring that Sarah was going to grow out of this or that Sarah would associate it would make the association that it was kind of  what we used to do with when I would read about the Indian or about lower I could I'm thinking that she would just kind of enjoy that but but she was getting more and more into it and more and more involved and the more involved more I could see how investors are once I mean it really was the main thing going on in our life group. And as she began telling friends about it and so forth, the stories had to get more and more labraching food, all the stray bits of details that were receiving into things. And I didn't quite know where it was going to go. I would do things. I would send the borrowers on vacations. Do it to the moment vacations? I would send them. I just have them something to disappear for a while. They'd be gone for a while. And I would hope that by the time it was over sale. what it was about on the day. I said it'd be gone three weeks, three weeks later on that day. There'd be a note for them, Procedura. And Sarah did you suspect at that point? No, no. I really hadn't, the second I started to suspect it. It was , just I was almost sure that it had been him. And I just went up and asked him for a sample. Why is it that you started to suspect? Do you remember what happened at May Jesus' start? I think it was sort of... of the fact not his handwriting actually it was that I would tell my dad for instance that I was in the basement I stuck my finger into his hole I felt something sort of  silky or something it was why I did some  oh piece of cloth I was stuck there but I felt I told my dad and sort of slipped away from my finger I told my dad about it and then in the next letter I hear an anaballi saying oh  I think that was that you who touched me when I was wearing my silk dress And so I started thinking, , I tell my dad things that sometimes I'd exaggerate a little bit, , because when I was young, I exaggerated some things. I mean things a little bit more exciting when they might have really been. And then  I read the letter and it had that exaggerated part and it , and so I took, that didn't really happen. I was just  sort of adding back to my story and so that's, so I  that. Yeah and I asked my dad and so what happened? I was we had moved to the new house we've been there for a couple of months at that point and I was down on the basement , we've boxed around Sarah came down there and And how how old she's now she's out eight. Yeah, okay in this story. Yeah, yeah As this part of the room and and she said she began She was her lips from Wayne low lips from Wayne and she's she looked at me very Probably she's Daddy I'm gonna ask you question now and I have to tell the truth because it's a sin for daddy's to buy to their daughters. And my heart just sank and she's a daddy, for you the one who's been writing down in all these notes. And I looked at her and she looked at me and those  silence from five or six of these in the last year. , it's kind of complicated for me, Tom, and she said daddy is not complicated. Simple for you the one. And I said... What can we talk about it? Wait a second. No, just tell me, are you the one or not? I took a big breath and I said, yes, it is me. And she broke his cry. Oh, God, she was sobbing. She started sobbing. It was easily the most wrenching thing that had happened in my parents who were going to get one. I had totally wanted, just felt totally disaster. And I was crying and she was... was crying and no, we were both kind of touching each other and holding each other and it was really a trap that we were down the whole, that one we were in the big trouble. And suddenly this kind of calm came over to Sarah's face. It was kind of  the sun rising in the morning and her forehead stopped being furrowed and became smooth. And she just looked at me and she said, Daddy, don't you realize you ruined everything? indigenous? There are flowers in you, were taking the letters before they were able to get them. And it was a way of, she had solved everything there because the mother thing that was about she was going to be able to tell her her niece and they could all shortble about what kind of her crazy father had. And it was amazing. She found a way of getting us out of this zashtive that I could go to my apartment. I remember saying that, , you should have left it there. Maybe they would have really written that. You should have done it because maybe they would have actually written that. Yeah. I finally had some point. I said earlier, I still believe in them and I know that Nissan Roy Baby's to some kids might be who might listen to the I still believe in them. And when I told Megan, my friend, when I told Megan that it had been my dad, she stopped believing in them. And she was just , whenever I talk about Manoji, , , I'm , oh, I'll say I stop in the baby. Because she's a year older than me, so she had that time. At that time, she... still consider yourself  really superior to me even though we are best friends. And I'm just saying, oh, Sarah stop being the baby. It's not true. It's just not trying to say by seeing them and she said, no, you haven't. You just imagined it. And it's not true. You can just stop imagining it and stop time being about because it's not true. How do you feel that it now when you look at those nerves? I don't know. It's sometimes when I read them. I still sort of can think that, you know. I wonder why this happened to happen. I wonder why that happened to her. Wonder why she would say that. Even though I know that it was my dad writing to me, I still sometimes sort of think of there being an antibody somewhere out there. When we pulled out the box last night of letters, they did it bring you flashers through the letters. Well actually, I look at it a lot. You do. You do it a lot. Yeah. I'm going to say something. Well I just think it was sort of now looking back on sort of nice things to do. That because I'm... When I was happening, I had asked him, well, can we still sort of write to each other? In other words, we never really actually wrote to each other after that, but I just sort of thought after a while that it was a nice thing. And that even though maybe there wasn't a bar we were writing to me, there was maybe having my dad make up this whole family was maybe just a special thing. Me just a special thing. or maybe almost a special as having actually be fighting to a far more. Sarah, can I ask you, what do you think the lesson of this story is that is if parents hear you tell the story, you and your dad tell the story on the radio and if another parent gets into this kind of situation, what's your advice for them? Should they go on with it? Should they write letters and should they keep up stuff? I don't know because it was really fun for me to ask. I just kind of experienced that when I found out that it's my dad writing, it was really setting. And so I just, I don't know. I think that I would, if I were a parent and I had that kind of thing, I would not pick it up. You would know. I would, I would people and girls in my kid, my child to keep on writing to the, Mars and time to get them to write back. But I wouldn't think. Because one of the key points, so sad every morning, the way you were sad on the minutes, really, I wish I wish I was being done. Can you imagine ever picking up? No. It just... I don't think it's fair to me, someone else. When it's very short and so it's what's the lesson to story. If you've had this to do again, you would get into the situation again, or if you could go back with the benefit of hindsight. What would you do? Would you have left the letter? I mean, I'd  to say that... Had I, with an over again, I wouldn't do it this way, but I'm not. because it was a, it started so naturally. And in the end, by the way, what I'd have to say is probably the most poignant, closest, amazing moment I've had, as a single, , the moment I'll remember of a particular phase of my life is that is the holding onto each other in the basement, both of us crying, but, but, but, Sarah, not running away, Sarah, save me. And that kind of cemented our relationship in a really kind of wonderful way. So I mean, , I don't... In my mind, I'm in that way for everybody. Yeah, it might not end that way for everybody that's true. It was, it's a, I continued to, to, to hustle about it. It is unresolved for me and that's my answer to everything. It's interesting to me that the way that you view the lesson of the story is that Sarah saved the two of you that is a parent. You got yourself into a moment where you literally didn't know. what to do and that she finally said the thing that made everything okay. I absolutely feel that. Has it affected our relationship? You think you're not crossing the way you used to be? No, no, I still just. Sarah, do you view this as one of the moments when you were crossing the two of them? Well, I'm very cursed by that. So I don't know. It's , yeah, I guess so, but it's not  much closer than I am usually because I'm very close to my dad  all the time, but yeah, it is one of the times I was close to him. Yeah. So my heart is in my throat. Alright, so actually it's now the artistic director of the Chicago Humanities Festival. He's the author of many books, including his latest, everything the risers, book of the purchases. Sarah is now 19. This past year she's been teaching him. gotten in remote village in Tanzania. She was up to college in the fall. Back when we recorded this interview eight years ago, she said that even at the time we were recording the interview, she's still believed in bars. In fact, she said she was going to listen to the story, but not in the house. I don't want us to listen to it at the house because if there are still bars in our house, I don't want them to hear that.
