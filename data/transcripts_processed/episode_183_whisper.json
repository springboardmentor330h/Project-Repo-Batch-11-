It comes up because punished for justice. Best example I think he did is he's not a lot of crusts to find himself at him. And he went over to an Avers' house and then he came back by himself. And I kind of saw him do that. He really just looked in, but I found who's not this is against the rules. So when it came in the house of this sector, and it's upstairs, sort of stopped upstairs. I'm gunna only find my money. I'm my money. I'm going back to my family in Africa. I'm not a this family because never, these prints are just... And he's stomping at the stairs in the middle, so he said to him, They're rules and f... Yeah, but they don't have roads in Africa, and so I wouldn't be grounded in Africa. Now this is the part of some reality in a number of ways. But one of course, there are roads in Africa. Number two, I wasn't adopted from that. He's not a prince. He was adopted from Chicago, which he knows very well. He has other parents who he could fantasize about. He could actually meet. I need a little one. Not yet. I asked that many times and have offered to help you find. He's not ready for that. It's so interesting that it's not a desire for the actual parents to desire for perfect parents. Santa Seas pretty wonderful. You're a person after pretty much. In 1908, Sigmund Freud read an article with a disturbing name family romance. When she pointed out how common it is for children to fantasize, it's on point or another, that the parents that they live with are not the real parents. The real parents are out there, somewhere, and a person, or a risk-dequrats for it, says, it's comforting to bear with the flaws of any real parents. And if you are somebody whose real parents aren't around anymore, really? How will you choose to imagine them? When do you want me out? and when do you want dance? But today on our radio show, we're bringing stories of children put into that position from WB, Zizha Kago, Public Radio International, which is American Life. I'm out of glass today, stories from the missing parents bureau. We're bringing four-stakes examples, case one, better left to the imagination. One mother's who are impregnated, the samples from sperm banks might choose to know less about the donors, rather than more. Case two, talented void. in which we have these funny moving letters the mom of a 13 year old has written to the kids absent dad. But as she writes even though she has no idea where to send them. Hectree, I'm an orphan, don't tell my mom. Startle kind, remember his back in the day, whenever he wanted to be an orphan. At four, run away mom, see out story, baby meets mom, baby loses mom, baby asks after mom, adopted parents wonder what to say about mom. That's very from Dan Savage. Stay with us. That one better left to the imagination. If you want to understand how much kids and the parents left behind, think about it and add some parent and what it is that they do think about. Consider what happens when kids are born to infertile couples or the single moms with sperm gotten from a sperm bank. My sperm banks provide all sorts of information back in terms. and parents getting the sperm can actually choose how much they want to find out, how much they want to keep the sperm down, and how much they'd rather not. So we speak of the sperm. The donor is German. His interest include music, literature, and comparative religion. He claims to have scored 780 on his math as a tease and says that as a child he'd sell it both violin and piano. Then in fact, in school he was at the top of his class in music theory. He lists his favorite qualities as discipline, strength. honesty in order, and we're asked what message you would  to convey to the recipients of this scene in the right. Take the middle path, avoid extremes. Treat everyone you need the way that you'd  to be treated, and please read the Razor's Edge by SummerSitMom. The donor is Chinese. He says that he is excellent at visualizing abstracts, he can quote, take any car apart. and learn it inside out. He can run six miles with a play-to-talk. His hobbies include micro-brows and football. When asked about his ambitions in life, he writes that he wants to help transform or moon for human habitation and creates some kind of food supply that will replace meat. He says he's the victim of sperm donor because he wants to make sure that his genes are perpetuated with the future. He also writes this book, a student, he said he needs money. There are six facilities for us in Pot smoking surfers, future doctors, out of work contributed to programmers and hopeful actors who are currently employed at the dairy queen. They come in all shapes and sizes, but most of them are there since the money. The young men who walk up the street and are given dirty magazines, a small plastic container in private room. But first they're forms to fill out. Health surveys, families and trees as a question. This information and there's a lot of it is then compiled into catalog. Gosse Panclots still with men sorted by ethnicity or level of education and then sent through the mail. Sometimes to infertile couples sometimes to single women's. People whose lives have worked out quite the way they had hoped but who are ready to cut their losses, sheltered out and seceded to the land they've. And now this is that Pauline L see the of that some guy, , it's about making a very scientific decision. On the first page of my recorders in the book, under the heading Karen in Brooklyn, there are these three words, organized, peaceful, and fantasy. The first two words refer to Karen's partner, a spacious one bedroom in fancy apartment house, two blocks from the park in the third word, fantasy refers to something Karen's up to me in the first five minutes. burned to you. She assured me, in the most reasonable tone possible, that the traditional idea of parents that was in there. Abilip goods we sold ourselves in order to bolster the illusion control. You think you because you marry somebody and you love them and you get together and you're going to have to trial that you can sum up for a dip, but your kids are going to be , but you can't! Your kids are going to be something else! You kids are going to be its own thing! Every parent I've ever spoken to has told me that their kids would have came out , you! just the way that they are and that it can just sort of unfolds. So there's no more guarantee that I'm going to be able to identify what my kid's going to be  by picking a donor. As there is by picking a husband, I'm put this idea of parent-developed a fear. I call it the theory of genetic variety. She believed that the health of her child would be substantially to grow if she could find a donor who was the genetic opposite of herself. In Eastern European Jew, she was there for a searching, she told me, there's something along the lines of Cuban sweet or maybe Siberian Argentine. She talked about this theory for a pretty long time, carefully emphasizing that this process was not that love, that about locating what she called a little genetic material. Then she bought at the folder, a stack of catalogs almost a foot high, which Karen had read using a system, checks and access. We begin at the top. Brown eyes, brown straight hair, medium skin tone, and then his education, this guy had a bachelor's psychology. A lot of them are students, so you're not going to get much , their, their occupation is quality what they want to be, rather than what they are. Now that's kind of interesting to me. I mean, did it feel weird to you at all that you would be having a child with a much younger man? Oh my God, so bizarre. I should imagine here that although Karen looks extremely young, this small thin frame. and smooth ten-fifth , which is actually 39. When I saw it, if they felt  really young and boyish for whatever reason, I couldn't think I could use that. I had a pass, even though it's just genetic material. Absolutely. I can control, I do predict that, seeing the age which sent us really weird feeling through me. But it just did. And I went to my email group about this in a lot of other women, shared this saying, feeling that it just feels... funny or not. I want to almost say it's monstrous. I want to almost say what the word not monstrous but  there's a word for that when you statutory rape  it was a sentiment which came to square very well with the notion of scientific process. After all the sperm of the need teen year old is no more or less the term of an idiot year old as Karen or so. even though this is a process that I've have tried to make very sort of organized scientific. And , there's this part of you that you can't really control and you can't really predict and it just leaves out your Kind of  a spider in the white That part of Karen, which you could not really control or get kept in true deonic search, another one of us between There was the problem with the redhead to be on his first sample a man who was clearly an inappropriate choice that is red hair attractive Karen because it reminded her of a college boyfriend. Then one day Karen stumbled on another girl. His test scores were in his highest mothers. His family had to help the problems which gave Karen a lot. Still, there is something in his essay answers which caught Karen's off. The quality of the speech that she found somehow familiar. , and he named all these new last ways of experiencing world, I just thought, well, all this guy's constantly getting away that I'm coming. and now I appreciate completely another people. He just felt completely right. And he was my guy. That was the guy. After her decision, Karen found herself thinking about her doing her more and more. She read over his information packet and talked about something with friends. what the sister did and she had a kid. I was going to... , how does this cool look at all the language they speak? And I played violin and he plays violin and I felt  he was good and right, positive. And , I just thought it was going to work out well for that it was, I was bringing good stuff to the kid. And then I called up on day to order, or to ask what are the badges  a couple, and I just wanted a time, but I was trying to psych myself out, but I, over ordering, , because I figured I'd rather get stuck with X-X from a kid. So let's do that one. Just call that, , , I forgot my period, , yet again, on all the four or four, they were , oh, is that available? And I was , what? Now, everybody will tell you if you've paired for this. I'm just told you, I've paired. I got so attached to this donor. Got that. I think I cried, I think I just sat down and cried. Without meaning, without even being fully aware of her own behavior. Karen had gotten attached and transformed her daughter into a kind of Santa boy friend. This is an uncommon, several of the women I spoke to described a similar attachment to their first donors. Unlike the others, after her first pick up that rooted. Karen. felt the sounds and flaws. She cursed, she cried, then Karen got out her catalogs and looked again, but this time she didn't dull over her say questions. Karen did it five numbers. My second donor, he's a much more elite god. He'd because that stuff's just easy to jump on. This guy's got a doctorate, he speaks  before lying, which is, I was brilliant. Do you feel less emotionally attached to this second donor? I do. And this created its own problem. Karen wanted some kind of connection. Something which would allow her to feel that the father of her child was not simply a random stranger in the sperm bank, which is actually what he was. But a worthy man, someone who is spect and proud of. But another way, Karen wanted some story which explained her choice. A story that she could tell to herself. A story that someday she could tell to her child. It was what she had to offer in lieu of something more substance. and she wanted to get it right. In fact, this needs further connection to some narrative which justifies Detroit. It's so profound, so important to this process, the Karen has decided to improvise relationship with her second son. The brilliant doctoral student with high marks and everything is originally Spain. Karen is planning a trip, kind of ghost honeymoon with the idea of the dad, the form for a baby, not yet born. If I'm your parent, it's a daughter, I'll probably go to buy some. alone and go to that region. Just so that I can have done that while I was pregnant with this child who's father probably came from that region. Just so I could have that to share with this kid. And that'll be the way that you communicate with his father to take a lot of pictures and I'll say, I don't know where you're fit, but , this is where they're from. This is where they're from. These are your people. And I'll go back with the kid, as such. As soon as the kids read a travel, we'll go there. , we'll go there and I'll say this in person. How are you friends? Increase your knowledge and increase your grief. It's a lot in poverty, I don't want to. And remember, I guess this seems  the soft-to-lead and weight of. But anyway, this is a lesson which Karen, many of the other women I spoke to. seem to understand intuitively if they want about choosing your donors. In addition to medical histories and nasty questions, many of the sperm banks offer pictures, audio tapes, even videos of contented donors. But the women I spoke to seemed very interested in the options. Not one of the four wanted to see a picture, they didn't want to watch video to use either, and only two were chosen to listen to audio tapes. At first this can be used for you, then I talked to June. I had no idea what I was going to go for it. So I said, well, let me go, , if I could pick my husband, what he looked  and if you was, , smarter not, that's what I'm, that's what I'm going to kind of pick. , so, , it's all to our kids. It's, it's Halloween, it's died. Sounded good to me. It's not that Jamie is a hairdresser. He lives in a comfortable farmhouse for the role of the state of New York. When I drive to our home, I have eight of Tuesday night. There's so few lights in the area that it sometimes did cool to see the room. Sitting at our kitchen table. Jamie tells me that even though she's always been independent, she started her own business in early 20s, she somehow knew that she wanted a family. It wasn't until her early 30s though, when her best friend became pregnant with her child, that Jamie decided that it was time to start filming her film. She contacted the sperm ring and immediately found three men seemed to track. One donor, particular, had caught Jamie's eye, and when the information affected her right, it was his date with Jamie with some two friends. , I listed his... I was , I'm not. He just didn't sound  anybody that I would have ever want to keep talking with. I don't know if he was just, I don't know. I, it's hard to explain. It's just something that I couldn't connect with. I couldn't feel , oh, , the sounds really cool. Not at all, not at all. And then I, I said to myself, maybe the audio too is not really a good idea. Maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's  too much, because maybe I'm really gonna love a month on paper, maybe I'm. Okay. Okay. And he just victory with the words, and then yes, then he broke his screen. And then he just kicked a face, and then left his house. And I know he's just a kid. And he's just so learning that it fits us all right. And then in his face, he got everyone there. you said, and how I  name, that the way I'm gonna, and that work quickly change my outlook and that experience of liking someone on paper and then listening to their audio tape was that a mirror that was definitely weird that was weird because   once you hear someone's voice it makes them real you if you ask, can you describe the dinner? you won't just ever see. should I hear that you think this is about six feet tall? She said that he is curly, black hair, and hornroom for glasses, and that when she thinks of him, she imagines him to be the black. Standing black thing, similar to the screen of the black. If you ask, we'll be for sure. She'll also admit that she's sometimes fantasized with it she needs to listen. And they fall in love and get married and look happy to the black, which I've got. But two-second flitter, Jamie will tell you that she knows how to take into the sound, which doesn't take it seriously, it's just a thought she had. Jamie was 32 years old. She allows herself to stay and should allow herself to stay. Because she knows she's a no danger of escaping her past reality. The children are different. They're kind of a incident that doesn't exist in our imagination. , I don't want them to have a picture in their head of somebody who didn't want to be with them. I don't want it to just be a man who... Let us, , borrow these special seeds that, , is very generous of him, but I don't want to tell, , the child world. This is what I thought you looked  and, , this is where I think he lived. I don't want to paint that whole big fantasy picture for a kid and then that person's not there. This is the situation where I last spent. not think too carefully about who or what it's father is. But are the women of all the issues for a video? In fact, I would make a further argument that previously even though creating a child is one of the most intimate things two people can do, this entire process depends on anonymity and all parties remain as abstract and abstractions possible. To understand why this might be considered the issue of the guest owner. A guest owner is from best big friend. Our man who's willing to contact with after chat turns 18. In other words, a potential real father that they kid who would call it meeting. On the surface, the yes donor option seems  a good idea. It certainly seems  a better deal than never meeting your father at all. But when I asked her, I'd have a huge surprise if she used it. She looked down in a lap for a second, and she was a little bit more answering. Then she shakes her head now. When I made the decision to be single mother, part of the challenge. part of what I knew I was giving to this kid that was something I was going to have to think deeply and fuck again again. I was bringing kid into the world who's not getting no other. Period. So the idea of someone who the kid could later contact, that wasn't appealing that. Because the message I'm going to have for this kid is, , this is our family, our family consists of being you and our village and people around us who love us. They're somebody who's your father. We'll never know who he is. He made a decision to do something for a woman  me and we're really grateful about that. But he's just not, , he's not your dad. And maybe that's something to grieve. I mean, to be angry at me about, but I had a vision of having a woman's love to offer you and a unit this was that we could get through this. That was always what I thought I would bring to being so long. , so. being able to hold out the promise to the kid that they could meet this person. Yeah, I couldn't imagine raising you to say, well, one day you'll meet your dad. What if one day meets a sad niece socks? , or his change is mine, that he's rejectable. , I mean, I don't want to raise a kid with that, , with fantasy or reds going to be blown to this, that you've matters,  what, you don't have a dad. You have a lot of other things. I know for my conversations with others in my mom's butt churries. The relationship between a mother and her daughter changes her part. And then even women who are reasonably indifferent to their donors during this election process tend to solve and capture a child as part. On a message for it, a new mother's talk occurred mysterious connection they said was built. don't. And right things , if I could only send a picture, I wish that he could see it. Meanwhile, the men financially strapped college sophomores of school actors, future doctors, continue to realize more or less the liviets. They finished college and gone to graduate programs, they moved mellis in which the real estate, they become actual doctors and strapped around practice. Without realizing that there are three, four, maybe five middle-aged women out there, you're trying to send the older writers below. would or challenge first to. After talking to a number of these women, I think about that some time. I think about lining up all the middle-aged women in all the 20-year-old men and letting them get a good look at one another. I think about kids in the mean tricks and imagination, but when there's no reality only absence . And then I think about Karen, and I decide which is right. But it's high where single-mile might be to the same thing. You don't have a dad. The problem is not a dad. The dad doesn't exist. The sitting child will remember not here. You'll all mother things. We speak on New York. Life without a father is a hard thing. We try to grow up things again and meet something. I was born years old, I was born in this photo room. Case 2, tell it to the void. As we speak a pointed out at some point, some moms get a very pointed desire to send photos and information about their kids to forever have something. But exactly what information do they want the dads to know? And why really do they care if they know it? Not long ago, this website voted publishing letters. a wide variety of people. This is called OpenRetters.NET. Published to series of letters from a woman in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the CardiSuff X, and its letter X. These were her dispatches to the father of her child. The father was somewhere out there. The detail of what the kid was doing these days. It's called Fit O. So, this is where he was G. X is a significant other of his C. Here are some exes. Come some exes. Here Mike, he's 13 and a half, into your probably known. And things are happening. happen. So first thing this morning when he lies open and his sheet is as always and it's flickably half off his bed. He grabs his CD remote control with push to play and is here fat boy slam all over the house. Same house is all we've only just read a yellow and a hot blue. He comes downstairs all armed and rags his knee. He's tall taller than me in his jaw box of waxors, his sits at the dining room table eating hunting that Cheerios and reading yesterday's calm. He has the number 60 of leg black marker. That was his number yesterday at Financial Basketball Triads, which he didn't make due to lack of confidence at the coach. Though he's got the moves, the next year he'll be older and ready. It doesn't bug him. None of his friends made it this year. And his school coach, it's all done they wouldn't, but that it would be a good experience. That's what the UN is friends said to each other after the Triads. Hey, good experience, eh? Oh yeah, excellent experience. Now that was a good experience. They're pretty funny. He's got a choice this morning for lunch. They go in cream cheese, turkey sandwich, or peanut butter, and the sandwich. He chooses peanut butter and banana. He plays around with a dog for a while, tells G, whose ten-year-old sister, who's getting ready for running club, that when he had running club, they ran in the ring as they were tougher back then. And then he checks out his... reflection in the Toaster oven. And Ophi goes to catch his best for school. Have a good day, I tell him, and says, You too, I can't call after him after his left house, if I love you or do you have the lunch. This mortify soon. Later today, he's got a different basketball practice for the regional team. He's going to miss his baseball game, go to the basketball practice. His baseball team was called the Sabers and the pitches and catches and was a great picture of what a wicker could. However, it prefers to catch. And if you could see him make the throw from home plate to second,  how good he is. Then I guess he'll come home and ice cream and chocolate sauce and watch him that television. He loves the comedy channel and Letterman who loves Letterman too. And thanks to the cool that Letterman and Nolan Ryan and his grandfathers all have the same kind of heart so to read. Maybe check out something on the net  this. phone number of that phone booths and a little bit of desert so we can call it some good. And then go to bed after some kidding rarer and you'll call out from this freshly pinked green and charcoal bedroom. Hey, whoever put high sheep back off things. I know you want to know one thing, but I'm not going to tell you what it talks about, you're not. But what if you even remember? I've tried to keep track of you seeing a bloody, but I don't think that's hearing more either. What do you live? To Pam still or what? Australia? you told me? I'm not asking for money. I'm not asking for anything. I just want to tell you that you kid before there's no kid left. And we're both 100 years old. It seems so stupid not to talk. Keep the stuff up or red. There are no new things I've been telling you. But you don't have to choose. Side X. Here Mike, he's not here right now. He's over at my mom's watch, usually a suspect, and we're covering from the cobra, which is a killer ride at this carnivate in the end today, downtown next to the river. We can handle those rides very well, but he agreed to go on the cobra with a sister twice, which I thought was sweet. Afterwards, he merged back to the man, Clarkson's bottle of coke, making fake barking and saying such. anything for the kid. I just remember how no one would go with me on Koba when I was a barfine woman's kid and more barfine. I just couldn't do that to her, following on grass motion ones. Really sweet because G-Gagolve and said that when he was being nice to her he was the best button world. The other day, bottom saw the half is it. I was kind of upset about it and asking about it. And my sister and my mom also asked me not to. And he said, man, we can just all relax. But oh I said, do  what a porn star is? No mom said, what's a porn star? And I said, well, okay, it's one of person who comes very good at it. And he said, yes mother, I know what a porn star is. I was kidding, God. And then he told me it was a brand. Just a brand. Or maybe the set of things the chat remembers. And I said, well, okay, I'm gonna get a porn start at for me too. And one for N to M, one for grandma. And we'll all wear them if it's just a brand. Fill your boots and sew it and stocked off. So it was kind of a dilemma to take this hat away or just let it go or buy in a different one. I suggest that a different one. And he said, yeah, please get me the one with padding to the down. So, finally, my sister called and she said she could have put in a pun butt, not to wait a porn star half, and he said he'd think about it. The next thing I know, my sister's being used for a bunch of literature, I'm put that at the front. What do you think you'd have done? Have you ever heard of that brand as you've gone those green more than the red we liked? Now when you see a kid with a porn star, T-shirt or a hat or a bumper sticker, O says to me, go get him home. Today is my birthday, and I'm drinking orange juice and chef food right now. He stayed up till 2 in the morning last night making me a mixed tape of songs in New Life  stuff  me and the Newman, Paul Westerberg and Tom Wings and the New New Young, leaving the clash. And it's so sweet because he actually had the wissing of all these old guys when we made it. Which was a form of twerker form. So it means a lot. I'm listening to Christmas card right in Tom Wings. You remember that. You do. Strange thing is I can't remember your birth. We were together long enough to put together this funny intense shy kid who stays up late for the compilation tapes for the old baby. But not long enough for me to remember the day you were born. Was it April something? No. No. No. No. No. So today I'm 36. And you get to stage 23 for a black-rated revise and an M. F. and FUT shirt or converse sneakers smoking an export A and cooking pen and  there's some shitty apartment chip to you at the cramps playing in no furniture. Soon I'll be old enough to be your mother. Sometimes I do think I see you on the street and if I'm with O I sometimes look over it and I wonder if you think it's easy to see me. If you remember as much the one who was left for a five and you went many golfing with him and left forever. And I want to ask him, but at the same time I don't want asking. You take up a lot of room for a guy who's not here. Later, restrain him. X. Chair Mike,  I was thinking about this letter thing and it occurred to me that if you're ever going for a spawn, you'd need to kind of an amnesty deal. Libraries have to return way over the books. Which means you don't have to go over the last 10 years pointing out all the stuff that happened that they've been using They're not making contact in all that or blame yourself or seek redemption You can just start again as of now Because if we have to dredge up all the old shit just to get to a place where we can talk normal you again or whatever They may never have to Overwhelming So if you want to leave the old shit alone and just start now. That's okay. That's perfect It's just a part is out there. If you're in Hawaii. But here's a story of Oz Blossom from church. He's playing baseball for the Sabers, and he's pitching in third inning. He does well, three up, three down. So next inning, two out, he's up to bat, and bam, it's home run. He's flying around the bases and makes it home and sits down on the bench as well as two nights at a moment that in high five's all that. But wait, something's up. The arm comes over, calls him out on second because apparently he can touch the base. So that's the third out, which means he goes to pitch immediately. He's looking okay, cool, but he's rattle. Obviously, as he starts throwing wild balls all over, except not over home play. This coach pulls in and puts him on third, new pitcher. So that's the thing, churdy. He's not there anymore. in rattles, that's normal, but that he tried not to show it. It was only evident in his pitches, not in his language, body language, that's that. But his pitch and couldn't hide it. That's what sport is all about. Excepting the call and shaking it off, at least outwardly. Last year, he would have been swearing probably and throwing his glove on for that sort of things. Not this year. And then, on top of it all, at the end of the game, I went over to him and said, tough call. that he did for a second. He said no actually yet. He said the uncle was right. Unbelievable. That's her kidney. That's the story of O's blossoming shirt. Gotta go. X. Dear Mike, more really big news. Last night O's school had its sports banquet quit in a morning. dinner and dance, and oh got three tropes which were the coach of your word for Junior Boys basketball, which basically means hardest work favors for Siddles. He's a weighing  things Carter and Kobe Bryant are wins. MVP for Junior Boys volleyball and get this male athlete of a year per grade eight. I can't even explain how long this is. They don't know this stuff unless of course you're reading the slatter. She probably are. It's next week we want to ride father. get a sense of size. That's right. Tell the boy how much you're son laughs. See told him how proud he was up in that he didn't have to do sports if he didn't want to. He wasn't having fun and that if he quit all sports today, he'd still left him and still be proud of him. And see told him how great it was that he was controlling his temper in the games when he lost or after that call or whatever. And also I'm just. and she said, oh what are you going to do? Explode on it, quarts someday? And O said, oh no, way worse than that. And she said, spit in the air of space. And O said, oh no, way worse than that. Okay, he was joking, but it reminded me of when you said, used to use your table all the time. And then around 12 or 13, after throwing a plate or a bottle of ketchup at your older sister who had taken your skidu suit or something, guess what? when, okay, that's it. I'm not gonna get mad anymore. It doesn't help me. It makes it worse. I get in trouble. I look  an idiot and it's stupid. And then sure enough, I'm trying to think of one time you got mad and a kid. You never got mad. Even when I was such a jerk, this stuff was happening. Just put on music and cooked noodles, smoke cigarettes and what? ustered, let's, But when I freaked out and drove myself to the hospital to have ao, it was about you or two relaxed about the whole thing. You ran all the way all those miles of city blocks to the hospital and came in all sweating and read and purple and I was already dilated and then you're said you look John Lennon said I'm here and here and I said some asshole thing you said come on look what's happening here this is big don't be mad now. All right that made a lot of sense but Mike it's still big. If you still here still happening. So don't you be that. See, I'm trying to learn more about, oh, if I remember what I can't do. It's a little uncanny sometimes, how some things are really similar,  this anger thing. Just out of the blue, the kid stopped losing his temper at the same age and you decided to stop losing your temper. So where did it go when you stopped losing you? It would be so. if you could get back to you really and you not need or me first or whatever. Not for some romantic thing, don't get the wrong thing to do. See in there great and you're probably married with other athletic kids. Sometimes I wonder if you just decided that it was best if you slipped away forever, best for oh and that you really really really need that. Remember when I stood on the sidewalk and printed my house with oh on my head, use that. two years old and I screamed my stupid head off that and while you walked away without saying the word, maybe you were thinking this is nuts, this fortune I got to go. That would have made sense at the time, right? But  I've come down since then. Even though I was a lot older than 13 when I figured out that losing my temper wouldn't get in next one of that. Allison Tyler Here, Mike, we'll send this almost over and ask these little odd things to happen. This is the latest. Your dad called here, right out of the blue, having seen our top home since over the infant, you and I took that road trip when we parked in the hotel bathtub, and he told us that he lived in Australia now, but he was in town, and we really  to see, oh, if I would  to see him. Oh, said no. Not because he didn't want to see him really, but because he just didn't know why. with purpose and serve. And your dad totally understood, instead of O ever changed his mind, he'd be glad. He'd wait. I asked him if you were happy, and he said, yes, very. That you live in Tokyo, that you're a very successful chef, an executive chef, he said, in a hotel with 550 students, and that you're married to a wonderful Japanese woman that you have a beautiful, free-world daughter, and that you probably never really took you. He said, he'd send all of her children. you're in the light of your daughter called her O's sister. He also said he was a lot  him, a wanderer, a bit of a loner, and that you often went off by yourself for steps of time and didn't talk about it much. But he sounded very proud of you, very protective, still he's worried I'd slagged a bit or something. And of course I wouldn't do that. My go says, what's the point? You're lucky, Mike, to have a spot. standing up for you. Have you introduced your famous penineners to the Japanese? Sayonara. X. Since posting those letters on the internet, X is identified or so. There's no impaves, which is a book of Newton following in the States, called Shingwell and Life. Proved as a read for a spy or lots of young, next is other ones at openvirus.net. Coming up, suburban child wants unhappy childhood, a doctor in couple tries to reunite biological mom and baby. What is this country coming to? In a minute, the public radio international when our program continues. It's a American life, I remember this. It's a good program, of course, which is a theme. You're going to have a variety of different kinds of stores in there. Today, stores from the missing parents bureau, we've arrived at the piece for you. History, I'm an orphan, don't come on. This is a story about wanting parents to be gone from the scene. It begins in the 1980s from the Starley Kong, whose life was not in years old. Decided, among other things, that she wanted to be a child star with a parents' generous hope to attend a series of classes run by a man having a dramatic, having a child as one of the best child acting forces in the business. By far, the strangest acting exercise that ever heard of, are participated in is his classed bestimmt character creature at the end. were instructed to make a pecharacter, the only guideline being that they had to be troubled in someone. We were doing six weeks to develop at the end of which in actual certified psychologists came into the class in psychological and livestock characters during a group therapy session. I chose to be an orphan. My character had been abandoned by her parents as a little child. I don't remember her name, but it was something in drudiness,  Sam. I lived on the street briefly for the most part. I can task from one plus to home to another. that I was terribly suspicious of adults. There were the family that wanted to adopt me and I secretly hoped they would, but was too tough to admit. The only one I truly trusted with my dog, for it's done in the gutter or something, he was just a puppy. To the best of my memory, nearly all my fellow classmates picked up in as well. They had similar backstories filled with unkindly familiar details. I tracked some of these people down, but they remember even... less than I do. Probably because afterwards they actually went on to play these church professional news. All of my classmates were working after some of the past of their other. You see them as you flip to the channels playing Comotos Children on the same elsewhere or Ricky Shodders first decent service pins or the young version of an older, more established actor on the sitcom's special Clashback episode. In my entire aspiring career, I didn't land a single role. No commercials, no pilots, no features. Nothing. It's the kind of record that sticks with a person from labeling labeling them  alcoholism. I will forever be a failed child stoner. Kevin Stilt teaches his reputation as solid as ever. And I visited his current class to see if there's still something to be done. He's great. Let us see what expression shows to you. location when I was a student with some things I was saying. The metal folding chairs, special spotlight they kept in use to cue scenes, the walls in the waiting room are still plastered with children's headshots, including an autograph photo of Mark Price. Mark Price played the never skipped the unfounded ties. He was in love with Mallory. Pictures up when I was in the class and it was always this was a pride to me that skipped the night to say, Captain Teacher. Mid-Series are backstrives added to skip his tender. Let's give you discovered he was adopted as a baby. I point the picture out to the class and they smile politely. Turns out they've never heard of them in ties. Kevin still does character group therapy, so now he places therapist himself. It begins the same way it always has. The kid sitting in a circle, they do a muscle relaxation exercise, and then Kevin counts them down into it. he's sitting in ties in the middle. three, you're in the peer group counseling session two, you are this character one. Welcome. Some of you were new, some of you started last week in our first group, I'm Dr. Roberts, but those of you who are new tonight, and I'd  to go around the room I'd  everyone to tell us first name and anything about themselves or why. here that they would  to share . There's a stunning absence of orphans. In their place is a property of 20WB style backstories in scandalous hour-long drama side-pots. One boy implicated his high-score girlfriend and his full despair of the possibility of forgetting her abortion. There's a girl in a abusive relationship. Another boy cuts his arms after his father become an alcohol. One of the characters saw her boy from the kids building a drive by shooting. An idea the actress got from not addition to the practice she got on right for class. The only kid in that story is remotely open for this played by a boy in Robert Decken. He doesn't cry, he doesn't even  talking about his feelings, to cheer up about the ability to problems. Oh, I'm kind of a little bit sad and truth. Well, if my car breaks down, I don't form a club with other people who's cars are broken down. You're in me, I got some of this. as hard as running for God's 6. Jesus. These kids don't understand what being a real favorite person is all about. That in the day, orphaned strictly from the Hong Kong history of Westerbrook, from Sierra, Sackeren, or New. In my class, this is one kid from the sobbing as I vowed, another would start, and rightly so. Now that seems to be a trend of more realist. lets dance performances... in places as hell the kids in the channel wear the crescent amps and snap the twigs windows open to come across deep and stiff on the cross DID beyond silence usually comes from Thank you. In the morning, my son is at a certain time. And this show is on, what show is on. And the show, show me how to show people. By the end of the class it was clear. We are just the orphans to come. Because at the time they were the North, the Givin, Arnold, Willis, Fondy, Fondy Boy, and Orton's Dominated Both of Big and Small Screen. They were even recruited to read new life into the classics. When she was waiting to drop, one of two things most likely happened. A baby of Lauren, Arnold, was discovered, sleeping in the hall, shopper's store. Soon after the orphaned team of prominent member of the cast, We picked off in the response to our depression. Just  Kevin's students today. Thanks. Johnny, last name. Taro's own. He only spelled for it. That's okay. It seemed to have happened and too too. Yeah? That was gotten this. He told me he's been watching a while of this map. But he says the name Johnny Taro's name is part of his name. Us. Who put about why you're here? Just a fucking love your group. Having said all that, I do think that the personal element choosing these characters. For the most part, these kids are from upper middle class families that are pretty supporting. Playing these parts, they aren't or bound against their families, as much as fantasizing about what life is  on their side. In my case, I chose to be an orphan partly because I came from a type of home where if my sister and I wanted to be a friend, you lived directly across the street. Instead of letting us just walk across, I'm all of putting in the coffee. are that the car out of our driveway across a deserted residential street and up into their driver to eliminate all chance of us getting killed in Iran. We often slide, though, we all about freedom. Orphans and after answered anyone, we didn't have a well-intentioned but irrational adult in charge of their reboot. They had their smarts, they had their sight-teap pet, they had their broken market, and they had themselves. That is it. One year's in Heaven's Class, a rope ladder meant tied together. of the bedsheets from Lung Hong, my suburban ranch has a sick story with her. But when I had to sneak out in the middle of the night and search my real parents, that was not favorite game. Character group therapy was just as good. Being in Kevin's class, it sometimes wasn't clear whether it was aspiring to be a child star or a fan or an afternoon work. Really kind, I just want to do this as a program. We were, then away mom, three years ago, Dan Savage and his boyfriend Terry adopted a baby. It was an open adoption when we both came to choose the adopted parents, and he's staying part of the family and the child. But things have not been working out. We decided to go ahead and try for an open adoption because we wanted our kids by logical parents to be a part of this life. We did this even though our agency warned us that we might be in for a long wait. The birth mother should spoke at a two-day seminar when we attended both said that finally a drug festival. homes for their babies was their first home served. Birth control wasn't a concern for the apparent right? As it turns out we didn't have to wait long for a birth mother to come along to believe being born once was enough. A few weeks after our paperwork is done, we got a call from the agents. The 19-year-old street kid named Melissa, homeless by choice, and seven months pregnant by accident, had selected my boyfriend and I from our adoption agencies pool of pre-screen parrot wannabes. Today we met Melissa, the agents and suggested that all three of us go out. for lunch to get to know each other. We were bursting with touchy-feeted classrooms which we soon realized was a problem. Stelik and Wary Melissa was only interested in the facts. She was pregnant, she couldn't have a baby on the streets and so she was doing an adoption. We were with Melissa when DJ was born and we were in her hospital room two days later what it was time for her to give him up. Before we could take DJ home we had to take him out of his mother's arms and she sat sobbing in her bed. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I was 33 years old and he adopted DJ and I thought I knew what a broken heart was. I thought mine had been broken a couple of times. I thought I knew I would broken her felt and what it looked . I'm mad at myself. what a broken heart looks ? a sobbing teenager in a hospital bed, give me a two day old and finishing those she can pick her up to a couple of she hopes can. There is nothing remotely not worth thinking about. a moment. She didn't smile bravely for her tears and say, take her care of my baby. She folded up and saw it and we stood there, feeling  monsters. We didn't meet Boccus, our son's birth father, and to almost a year after we adopted DJ. He was homeless too, and Boccus was his street name. Melissa hooked up with him for a few weeks when he was in summer, and by the time she realized she was pregnant, she got a blindness call on me adopted DJ. J. Bockeys didn't know he was a father, or that his son had been adopted by a gay couple. So we were tense when Bockeys surfaced in New Orleans shortly before DJ's first birthday. But all Bockeys wanted was what Melissa's get. Pictures, regular visits, phone calls. Bockeys turned out to be Melissa's opposite, smiling easily and put to laugh. most Homestreet kids, Melissa works as certain. Melanie zo se Gratello Re Aleis, industry actor and actor蹉 the screen and then the summer, then vermin the apple is Chicago and New York and the late summer early fall, New Orleans, Phoenix, Las Vegas and the winter. Then it's back up to Portland. But Melissa's in Seattle during the summer we all get together in a park where she goes out with her friends, so that she can visit with DJ and show them off. She keeps in touch by phone the rest of the year, but her calls are usually pretty short. She asks, so we're doing the ESCAP. She's doing, then we put DJ on the phone. The last time Alyssa called she'd asked for DJ. Her boyfriend, she told me died the night before it alcohol poisoning. They were sleeping on a sidewalk, he was lying to cider and when she woke up, he was dead. That call came in early November and they haven't heard from Alyssa since. Three months ago I started calling hospitals. Then, more. Then the clerk at the county Morgan New Orleans asked me to describe Molissa without thinking I started. to say, well, she's kind of quiet. The market's in the laugh and told me that all of his Jane does fit that description. Then just a sudden, we've got to stop calling. Soon, boxes stepmother, who would be DJs by logical step for grandmother, was calling us too asking if we knew where box was. He drifted from New Orleans to Vermont to Texas, she told us, and then disappeared. We haven't heard from Alyssa for six months. Boccus has been missing for four months now. The disbirth day came in Wanton, not  no calls. Last Sunday I was turned on the wallpaper in my office to home when DJ walked in. His best friend, a little boy named Haven, stepped in the night. After Haven's mother picked them up, DJ dragged a stool into my office and sat down and watched me call all paper down. on strips. Apen has a mommy. DJ said, m'lissad. And I have a mommy. DJ is going through this thing where he likes to make statements fact when having a confirmed them for him. This is if he's tested himself and making sure his reality jives with hours. That's right, I responded. You have a mommy too, just  Kate. You went on. My mommy's name is Melissa. I come out of Melissa's tummy. I play with my mommy in the park. Then DJ looked at me and asked me. quest for. When will they see my mommy again? This summer, I said, hoping it was in the lie, we'll see Melissa in the park this summer, just  last summer. I'm not sure what will tell the J of Melissa really has disappeared forever. What if he asks why he's mothered in 11 enough to stick around for him? Maybe we'll tell him that some people self-destructive, maybe Melissa knew she was going to self-destructive, and loved him so much that she wanted to make sure he was someplace he wouldn't get hurt. And maybe this end. and so we could not produce it. And maybe it was. One of the things my boyfriend brought to our relationship was a video from that. I didn't let him bring him to the hospital with us that day, but I didn't want a video camera over there. I wanted to experience those moments, DJ's first moments, in real time. Not sitting in front of a TV and months later. Maybe I was being selfish. If Melissa has disappeared forever, well, I did. you regret them. You don't have any good music or teacher in this butter. If you could see her the way we saw her, holding him, feeding him. Softly similar to him in our hospital back to 90-years-born. You would know what I, that is mother about him very much. And to have it just the opposite of the kid, what happened after my boyfriend and I decided to get pregnant. This American life is distributed by a couple.
