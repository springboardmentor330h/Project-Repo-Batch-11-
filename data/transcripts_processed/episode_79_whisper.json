  "text": "I was talking to a guy at a party, no demand. He's guys painting names and very charming. And we're talking about politics, and the guy that's on the desiccami is an actual member of the actual communist party. So how's it going? I asked him, it's possible it's communist. And he talks about the media and not getting communist in a fair shape, ? Of course, I didn't pamphlet that he gives me for some talk that I saw a trap where it's given. I asked him about the collapse of the Soviet Union in the East and the Rock. and then went to hell on the hole. worldwide movement. And each said, but communist has been saying for decades, though. So the union is not legal crimes. No one's tried local crimes, the way that it was supposed to be. And suddenly I felt  I was talking to a time trap. Somebody from the last few decades had not occurred. Or somebody didn't know. Of course I also spent years making movies about Nazis, sorry, the justice. His family was Jewish, he stayed Germany for the war. What's it  spending so much time in doing Nazis and systems? Oh, I get along with Nazis and said, you share something in common. I need you to stand up and ask. I share more of them than I do with most people than. You don't care about the next. Nearly a decade ago, I had a chance to interview the members and called camper van Beethoven. At that time, they were one of my favorite bands, but I sort of blew my interview with them because I misunderstood them and their music so grossly. I was... I was... I was... I will just say that right now they were playing a kind of country folk mixed with surf from music mixed with sort of fake Egyptian Russian music whatever else can keep my in-star. They openly sang about drug use and this is before our culture for we as a people at point towards slacker the chanx and I spent a lot that interview in donating the guys in this band by asking where they could be with a modern day hippies that was only crazy I had in my head to refer to what I was saying. that they were stuck in the wrong direction. But in fact, they were just carrying a few props from another get-tip in the present. Which is in fact, what do I think we all do? What time Michigan Avenue or State Street or Wallbashions, Chicago and New Seat? Older guys, wide-brimmed hats and 50s, coming out of the off track bedding. We were the Art Institute students, just in that fake 70s thing we could suffering through the nation for the last three years. We all carried this in the past. So this might another. which brings us to today's radio program. Let me be easy Chicago and public radio international is this American live, Marlon Gloss. Today on our program, people stuck in another decade, at one, the wedding game, to people who love 1970's television and how it affects their engagement and their wedding. Back to, the studies of teenager, to people who get suspended in time has had a lesson through different reasons. Act 3, curve walk. Two smart, funny, 90s men who have no problem working women or seen women as they're equals why? Spend 10 minutes a day walking around, scoping women, talking about them, they were jack women in some 1950s movie. At four, working in another decade, in which our trepid correspondent takes a job at Mount Vernon for Washington's plantation home, doing a job they'd gladly call, field at five. The Stounder, the Final Frontier. Someone who's stuck in a decade that is as far back as you could possibly go. Back in the day before back in the day. Today, when all matter in the universe is just in the single point in space. You remember? Stimmers. The End of the Day. The End of the Day. The End of the Day. Back one. The End of the Day. The End of the Day. The End of the Day. The End of the Day. Most Commenters. the people get stuck in other decades so they get stuck in the TV shows by the decades. Considerably this extreme case example. Carl began his life with normal excessive relationship that most of the sudden emotions see child who watched 6 or 7 hours a day. Wendy, when he can further, she actually watched TV to see herself. She could growing up in Chicago so she would hear a commercial search. Donald, her series, was allowed to see even in a Maristica capital. Wendy knows Maristica. They actually showed my face because it first time for top half. Do you have a speaking part? Yeah, I had a line. It was already Carl. So if  the commercial line. You remember that? I love that spot. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're watching the Dickman Darkshow, McRill, old game shows. It went to these paddy suits. Carl says that one. learned on an episode very time  more show, five seconds. Turned off TV and next one to identify the episode. Tidesquad every time. And this turns out to be a remarkable job spot. It was for a station and Chicago that was launching and they were going to run old shows and I got the job by writing scripts for promos based on episode and lines I remember. So I didn't even have to see the shows and I could write scripts for that. So... I grew up in the, I grew up inside the television. I just kind of wanted to stay there,  Mike TV, I really wanted to go. That's me. And I was wanted to be there and watch Zoom and all the shows and kids just want to be here so bad. That's why I wanted to. So many people   70's or a TV, but the two of you have taken it further throughout the entire portrait process. So can I substitute a spankery briefly how you charge to pose? Sure. Well, , one of the reasons that Wendy said that she liked was that I could recite the lines from songs on Jets and songs on... So when it came time to actually get engaged, but maybe I could use something, at least to tell a bit of things. I was watching, so it's down. It was the episode where Marny by his great many. He was a friend. Please hide this. Holy well fine ring. So Wendy and I Well I'll hide it in your bowl. Go bowl. I knew exactly what he was doing when I found the ring in the bag. I knew what he was referring to because the whole day He had bought the splints don't see the music from the show He was playing throughout the day and after he grew strange and obviously didn't know what was going on But it all came together when I pulled the ring out of the horn You saw the ring in the bag and just now Oak is doing the things I'm hoping to see. Yeah! Absolutely! We're so over here. But all of this was just a play with just the order, just the 30-second format leads it to the very special episode of whatever. It all came to an end. The invitation was great big to E-Sense. This is not a test post when the conference you're actually in very dint or dancing and must see Madgerone. and weird This is a sound life. It's probably one of these wedding videos. They states the ceremonies to the nation. We're gonna ask ten questions. And they're gonna have to reach a hundred points in order to get married. And a caring where are you from? There I am, sir. Who is our first and best? Well done, we have one more. Well, it was very simple. night before everybody can't believe it did this thing. When we asked each other a series of questions, we had to answer on cards, much  they do on newlyweds. And we didn't tell each other what we were answering for the day. And we gave the judge, it's going to be very interesting. We gave him questions, he was to ask us these questions. And we were going to answer truthfully and see if we could get enough points to get married. Anyway, which one are you wanting? I'm a Wendy Wendy. And tell me something about yourself. I'm a housewife. And... , we both knew that it was going to be funny. So we didn't even need to rig it, set it up because I just knew that whatever he put down or what I put down was going to make an entertaining. And I thought the element of suspense was also really good. So we didn't cheat at all. I didn't know what he was saying and he didn't know what I was saying. So it was totally played legitimate. And then we did plan to do poorly. I think we did more really good. Yeah, there are a couple things I thought for sure we would have gotten right. We didn't. We're looking along here. We're going to question number six. Carol, to pick this up. My fiance is great. But her bright. She's something that we desire. Carol, answer me. Why , I, there's so many things that are great about. And I love her. Where do you go? But... Pretemper? Or maybe something to be desired sometimes. Everyone wants it a lot. Wait, we use... What? Just so it's common. Alright, well, I thought I'd not take my shooting. This is what I thought I need to improve on. And I'll surprise. I'll surprise. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. I'll surprise you. That's also one of the things that's so hot is that it most weddings you never see people have any kind of discord. Yeah. My dream, my dream would have been that we were just failing miserably, which I'll be enough happen. And that everybody thought we weren't going to be able to get married. And the last question was just truly impossible question that we both had to get right in order to get married. And there were some people who didn't think we were going to pull it off. There were some people who thought we weren't going to make it. I kind of made up only some of the videos with this. It's kind of hard to believe it. that he would believe that. Well, , I thought it was going to be hard to believe too, but I looked at people's faces. And they were really, what are we going to do? What are you going to do now? Oh, they totally believed that their people who came up to me and they said, I didn't think you guys were going to make it, and I thought it was just going to be a big party and nothing else. Where are we at? Where are you still at? What are you doing? What are you doing? Another unusual moment in your ceremony that is certainly not very traditional in the wedding is that you? Talk about the bathroom. What do we, I don't remember this. What do you talk about? Oh, spends more time in the bathroom. Come. Wendy, Wendy, I'd say that too. Wendy, what are you saying? Absolutely, Carl. Hey. Oh, women. If you saw this bathroom and you saw how much cleaner this in mind, he's been more time in there at least cleaning. Yes, but you saw all the cost with problems in the bathroom. We're in our bathroom and no. , it's definitely , , an image that doesn't pop in through the links. I don't know. So what are you saying? It's  this toilet tabo, which is the mention. I'm just pointing out your bags. Okay, I'm just being factual about what happened in what we should be shooting on. That's all. I'm interested in saying. There was only one question about our sex life, , sort. Name the movie title that best describes your gun life. No, I said best friends. What? What? What? What? What do you mean? Gone with the wind. Well, that's the one with the 10 points too. I'm curious what you're doing. We've got to get it right here as I mean . Right. My main third was that spotting. It's all I cared about. We got labs. I'm happy. So I had to question some of the people in labs and luckily they did, but I didn't care about I wasn't nervous I didn't care about marrying  the wrong guy. I knew us with the right guy and I knew us in the right place So all I really cared about was the entertainment value of the game portion of the evening really. That's all I thought about In a producer at me was worried about slowly entertainment...Camer and Meryl's iodine The plasticger had great time from them. the show for people. You buy the hair stuff and the cleaning stuff and the moisturizer you buy. I have to move this along. You have to go to the library. Okay, well maybe not. Maybe not. That's true. When I heard you do I am in those previous. Wow, amazing. And this is  being nuts. What would be an easy spot? Well, because, because of wedding, it's something I mean, I think it has to be a lot of drama, but it's a bit of a piece of music. And the context of it, , you're to go game sure doesn't see the space back. I mean, , I mean, come on, there have been some totally lame ass weddings that are banquet hall, , come on, , , you have the right to read throw in the flowers, you throw in the dress, you throw in someone playing a song from piggler around the room for what I reached. And you said so on anybody can write your own. Well yeah, it's , you throw in all the usual crap and that's supposed to be romantic. Let's, , that's not true. And nobody, I don't think anybody really said people actually said me, this is exactly the way I thought you were here. And that's me, said them. I'm there. What's it romantic at all? I think the most romantic part is maybe it was. I don't think you could say that there's a traditional romance. I mean, this is to make a romantic kind of to do what you want to do. It means the most to you. I think we achieved that. So it was very wrong. It was what the one it did. Yeah, I was right. The most romantic moment is a standard moment. It was a good moment. It was a good moment. , I actually wanted to tell the judge the stop. I just wanted to stop. And I just wanted to stand. Just just a bad point at home because it was all going by too. And I knew we were going to run out of video tapes, I didn't do that. I'm in this moment. For this moment, there have been many things to watch from. The questions, friends and the love of the tapes is probably even featured. So as , I'm much more wanted to have time to watch. I'm going to say a new word that takes you across the question, why? Do you feel  doing a wedding  this? Purgis, 70's TV, out of you. Oh, no, I think you're in the green forest. These things  an exercise system we need to get it out of our body. What's so different? Once you've been on the newy web game, you never need to think about it again. So if you're there, you hold true that people who have a romantic wedding never need to be romantic. You proud take one you to be here. Come on, jerk. I'm not talking to you. Sand is... I'm actually developing a show right now that similar to what we did in our wedding. So it was kind of a... trial run the wedding for the show I'm developing. In fact the judge who married us who's a real judge and I have been putting together the show because he would be the perfect post for show  this and I've kind of created a format for it and I would love to be able to produce it would just I think it would go really well. Basically it would be instead of the big ball part of what you guys actually do the people actually end up married. Yeah people would end up married again. And as a positive people might not get married. Wow! So there's another idea of something we can really acknowledge of. We did it first. Well, I, the bottom line is I've got the guy perfect for it. Without him, this is a real life judge who also happens to be a comedy writer. So he's perfect. I'm just a... Hmm. Coffee right and Wendy Miller was a television message. See Carlin about a month or a year. Ever since. I'm Dr. Norse, director of St. Joseph's Yon. And that is the most cheerful music I think we have ever put on this radio show. Act 2, stuck as a teenager. This is our program about being stuck in the wrong decade, and it is a truism among Alan Johnson and all the Ctrls Julien releases the 저glike P start using it. Is the year that you stay stuck at? So, you start using products at 50. It's very good everywhere. Connect 4, let's say. Continue until you're 40 and you stop, you'll find yourself a good year zone. Still stuck at the ocean level. Which means students. Had an embarrassing moment, I'm not so long ago. I was at a theatrical benefit and it was a friend of mine. We had to... done the adult thing of trying to get together, need, and we hadn't really got right. She was teaching in busy and we just couldn't get together. Now, I'm 43 years old, and I know the proper way to behave is to just shrug it off. But I am see, however, at this event, and I suddenly and inexplicably see this rage. It's feeling... I have a seizure. I can hear my behavior. Hosts seizure. I see her. I'm so good rich. She's hurt my feelings. I'm going to show her. Now here's how I do this. Tactic number one. Whenever we're both in the same room together, I let her see me. And then I'm walking. and it turns to a pet conversation. I grip my club so I hold it tight. Same thing. Cast my eyes down with, first my lips, walk over and start the conversation with someone that I know she had my eyes. I started drinking when I was 13. I started smoking hot and using speed somewhere around age 15. I started using heroin at age 24 by age 25 to age 6. I was in the fitness. And remained so delayed 40 when I stopped. So back to this event from just a moment. I would step outside occasionally, as far as I can. Now I have to keep throughout all, last 1 hour interval, Setting up voltage and still Overall level of the tough and ALVA after built-up. I don't do these kinds of things. I don't do not do personal relationships or something simple as that. I mean 15 year olds do. Especially really poorly adjusted drug addict in 15 years. So I'm standing outside, it's not in six. It's still under 65 eyes. Just a minute and 2 AM. I don't see what I see. Anyway, 1 or 3 AM on the reach of my third about abortion. But this unbelievably unique description. If you're having a eureka next month, you can see that there is ablethat, Do it. Pellaine once you've been sitting. She says it was  me first. She was away at dealing with other adults. As a child. Shortly after she was released, she'd have to get a state idea. And it was him. There are moving people along, and you should have out the proper pieces of paper for this. Pellaine, pay for this. particular person and then swiftly moved to the next place or whatever. And I really didn't know where to go. So anyway, I had to come back and the guy was on. You go around there and go around, go down the hall to the left and they left a lot of blocks. And so then I got in this other line. The guy was saying to me, that my birth certificate was not the award. And someone else just probably would've, I don't know, been more assertive, been more confident, more sure, in this other-man-off situation. And I was , just, I didn't know what. to do. And I could have saying, no, it is. Well, anyway, I've got out of that mine and my mom was waiting for me on the side. And I think by the time I got to be yours, I just remember I was at tears. She was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, she was just, , and you just want to kind of run and hide and cringe because again, it's more of those situations where, by all appearances, you look  an adult, you should be able to, , move her your way through this, handle this situation, . So anyway, it took me about, I think, three days used to work with me. encouraged to come back. Let's look at my original version. Show it. In fact, let's look at it once. Let's look at it once in the same thing. Here I start with the music. And again, in 1919. Okay, here's a partial reconstruction of a list. Last night I sat down and did it in the table. I knew it. is many records as I can remember of a record collection in 1970. Beggers, banquet, new homestones, candles in the ring, known name. Wallpower, again, the stooches. The first two modern lovers' records, who are moons first record, something else by the kids, the village green preservation society by the kids, blond on blond Bob Dylan, highway 61 revisited Bob Dylan, of course the velvet's third record stars they made for their husband, and his name was Indoog Strom applauding blank generation by the way, it's in Leonard Cohen, Song of some modern name. I brought my record collection today. So the studio, so we can look at it here. It's hard. That way it plays very well. More than 90 why, but I have to set it. See, Dave. And then we go between the buttons. The first legائres logged in thousands- another version of the 1995 grounds, a three-key broken subway devices, that are 33 km from thechaeological traffic troop, which has already fighters, plexiglass computers, ... Spersy. sense it all and being embarrassed. But I don't. So I want. I'm just sorry. I  how I do. Another thing that happened was I remember I was going to die down in the company that was in the department. The woman had the first person. The thing of you was her and that went pretty well. But then she wanted me to come back or something. definitely with the other people who said that the problem I wouldn't really make a side to it. The lunch interview. And so we went to one of these places where you kind of, you pay and you get a buffet thing. You could, well, that was new to me. I didn't know these places existed. So there of course being courteous and putting me first to go through the line. And I'm , no, I really can't go first here. Because I don't know, , the lady, the cashier had to give me the tray because I was just totally all lost. If she picked up that item. I'm just saying how to conduct myself in that environment. I don't know, because I don't think it's kind of things really, , average of people think about that, , where will the accepted me know how to use it, , how to come to O Country Buffet and, , carry on. I don't, I don't think so. It's just not something you really think about. I'm calling. Did I mention that? I have a car and I know how to drive. Two months ago, I did not have a car and I did not know how to drive. I loved my car. I'm 43 years old. I'm driving through the first time in my life. And I love my car. I'm 16 again. Or to say it another way, I'm 16. I never was. When I was 16 and refused to drive for whatever pigheaded stubborn childish reason that had stuck in my head, you see driving is metaphor for me. It's the marker I used to check the progress I make. I can't see it yourself. Planet that I inhabit now. It's another place to parallel world where I can move freely, knees and braze and it's that one adult behavior I perform these days with summer 14. When I'm driving, I do something I never ever did as a junkie. I engage and engage with the world around me in very real and zoned, practical way and call me Screwy. But I  it. I  it. I'm calm. In fact, when I'm done here, I'm going to drive home and I'm going to listen to a hopelessly ideas and take notice. in…ab That's it. Bye now. Welcome back to the video. I'm coming up. Stop in pre-temies decades. Stop in pre-emands and Haitian decades. Set in the decades for time and space and decades even existed. That's a new, upgraded international, man art book. GIPO GIPO GIPO Disamerican life in our class, each we can approve of course which is a theme for writers. It's a good one. Today's program. Okay. Let's go. Let's get this. Let's go. We've arrived at a three of our program. Straight to move with most of the bars. In the white power America, we're meaning. We're. Correct. See. That's nice. We retreat to a different America. , a quick warning to listeners for our. Through the story, there are no nasty words or it's the city. It's. It's. Great. It is a story that acknowledges and sticks to sex. That's what I'm talking about. It's a story that's important to me. This is a story about two people. One is my friend, and one is my acquaintance. Both are relatively highly placed editors, glossy, and murk magazines. The sort of magazines you might have in your pocket to hold a red waiting to get your hair cut. My friend, let's call him, Roger, is so charming that the first time I met him in his office, started talking, and I literally couldn't bring myself. He was funny and stylish and that's slightly homosexual and look-away. As to his opinion about something, he's as likely to reply, it's very ultimate, sub-deese, is to really tell you where to think. The last time I had lunch with him, he said, don't you wish people could only communicate using proper nouns in the names of medieval diseases? I heard that his wife was lovely, but I have to admit that I'm a little sad and married. What afternoon I called Project Work? We got sipped. He told me a funny story about basically hanging up in an Ruby subject. James Popstar report him. Then he said he had to go that a friend of his acquaintance of mine also magazine editor was meeting downstairs. We're just going on a purve walk and said, purve walk, I said. What the hell is that? Neat's later I sat him down at a cafe on green street and made him explain or tape. It turns out that a purve walk is exactly what the sounds . Catch him, Sprint Bill. Neat. A couple times a week. and walk around so how I'm commenting on the women that they see. Who came up with the name, Pertwa? My colleague. Your colleague? The term and I felt it's quality of brightness, instantly, clearly as a Pertwa. And you can use it as a Pertwa, boss. You can go on to say, place  the banana republic and Pertwa's. As they think I got a banana republic. So what can you do on a Pertwa for what can you go Pertwa for what can you go Pertwa? And what can simply prove? Check that right in the Pertwa's to be eaten. Not at all. Several days I began to set way taking shower, eating dinner, and I would just start laughing. If I were with people I made a spleen. I'm sorry, just that I knew these two guys will actually only one well, but as far as I can tell, there are these perfectly nice, very sweet, interesting guys, and they do this thing when they walk around so how we talk about women and they call it a perma. Some people look to me blank. Some use the word disgusting. Is there something wrong? I thought it was one of the funniest things I ever heard. I want you to do a demonstration. Think about the two top three top. The top saw underrated, ? I want you to see  no refreshing two top simply. I guess I should explain the words. Raj grew up in Queen, Bill and Archbishopado, two working class members of the two two parts of the country. Both still pointed out, near airports. Both home to a marketplace similar path to the dead. They've came better friends and learn more about each other. Raj and Bill start to get... the idea of the universe, the first part, we're actually the seed neighbor. Now they both work quite a lot of jobs, but when they curve they'll tell me they didn't come guys. It's  you've heard all our lives, , and that we've worked. One can't really talk seriously about the two types of things I've been talking about taking on, sir, or something. I know that some of you, many. Maybe even all of you find this disturbing. You don't find the idea of two men walking around saying live things about women. Funny. You find it juvenile. We actually are. A throwback to a time when it was permissible. For a man to say almost anything to almost anyone at any time, just because of the good. But I don't agree. First, let me tell you what, this is not horrible. None of the women they're looking at has any idea that he's got to talk to you about them. They never approach or touch anyone. It's not about pat calling or looking. reaction they're just doing it for each other they weren't even reluctant to do it me there but I did manage to talk them into letting me report 15 minutes see that hemorrhageic you  that hemorrhage stuff  I'm not so well I've got this open mind are you thinking experiment or check that this  check with the guitar and the beret Heart seat type, right? It definitely what that means. Abuse. . It was so different when I had imagined. Maybe it was a function of my being there, but they barely talked about actual body parts. In fact, they barely booked it the women they were talking about. They only looked long enough to find some distinguishing characteristics that they could riff. You just saw a bride with last. Want to give it the wretched gentleman face? which lady showed her the girl? Not. Not. what I'm saying? I admit that a computer doesn't say? Let's watch gentlemen, this is the new appell. Let me describe you as a person who's talking about his North Pole. He's wearing one of those bright blue shirts that the Gap has turned into this year's urban uniform. The shy looking book is wearing little round glasses. Raj describes both of them as the limp-wrested pencil jugglers. We keep walking and passing woman going through post-apples. Up until the post-pitch is a fancy... If you're better, what did you come in back and lick the postage and we can apply it? I'll lay your package. Maybe you'd  to see a mailing tube. Both of these guys work with women. They report to and have women co-workers. And there's no problem here. I asked Rod to figure out I'm per vlog because they're not permitted to save these pervy things about women work. You said that was a part of it. They're using fake news. They don't want anyone if their magazines to know that they do this. And there are enough blue shirt wearing gay looking straight men creating the halls from your publishing wall that I'm confident that we're teen or anything. They don't wish work is different. They don't wish they were back in the time where every day it work can be a per-law. But they don't want to stop per-vehre. So they do it as Roger says. It's silence and silence. Attention. Attention. Attention at John into a little world where they can attend the last 30 years, haven't happened. I was going to edit this stuff anyway. My friend Nancy. He lived. I guess what fascinates me most about the Pearl Blok, said it's a perfect distillation of something I see in that old time. Here, Roger and Bill, character of course, are speculating from a physical attributes a woman they've never even seen. A woman who's just the idea of a woman. And then they start flirting with her into the two people. And Nancy. and some names, anyway. What is that , a Latin? She's a little bit, yeah? Yes. Do you  a burning bush? I wouldn't enjoy such a thing. This reminded me the times in my life where I got in rock number in a man's answer. Oh, wrong number, I'd say. And go to hang up and suddenly the guy says, hey, are you hot? And it's not just strangers. Let me help. She even danced to the sweet all the time, I'll be telling the story about a friend that she just moved to a new neighborhood that she's writing a dissertation on French and teach Dutch genre in 19th century. And suddenly, they'll need to know right now, to have a nice body. The last 30 years have done their damnedest, we have men's mouths, and in some cases, in some context, in seceded. But even these guys, these type or eggs, holy modern, slightly nerdy guys, need their 10-minute per. And that to me seems honest. Sarah Miller, in the Lord. Pretty detail, Prettyreck, Goodbye We Vibe Tsecrack of versão fit but still fit sailing So don't move likeücks all the way I'll help me more I'll help you more Sorry The staff judge final frontier And this particular about people stabting around decades We can be done with story about somebody's death as far back as anybody can possibly Our story P doctoral Prow vy Praw vy With the calculations begun by it. the problem, the galaxy's velocity, the session, the universe is in header. It's constituted single point, or began to exist. Naturally, we were all there. We're all as good we are. Nobody knew that there'd be space, or time, even what used to be, for time, packed in their late-sarties. I say packed  sardines, is literary. In reality, the... There wasn't even space to pack a empty. Every point of each of us coincided with every point of each of the others in a single point, which was where we all were. In fact, we didn't even bother with another set for personality differences, because what space doesn't exist having somebody unpleasant or  Mr. Burr under foot all the time is just irritating. How many of us were there? I was never figured that out, not even the process. To make a count, we would have had to move apart at least a little. And instead we all occupy the same horn. Contrary to what you might think was in the sort of situation that encouraged social ability. I know, for example, that at other periods neighbors called But there, because of the fact that we were all neighbors, they would even say good morning or good evening. In the end, each of us associated only with a limited number of acquaintances. But once I remember most, I was just faint, I was just a friend as well. Family of immigrants by the name of Susu. Mr. Paburp Burr just mentioned. It was also a cleaning, maintenance staff she was called. Only one for the whole universe. She said it was so little. To tell the truth, you had nothing to do all day long, I'd even dust. Side one point, I'd even a grain of dust. So she spent all her time gossiping, cleaning. Just with the people I've already named, would have been over crowd. You have to add all the stuff we had to keep piled up in there. All the material. it was the serve afterwards to form the universe. Now it is modeled of the concentrate, such a great, you were able to tell what was later to be part of astronomy, and that would be love in drama. From what was assigned to geography, the voice, for example, or to chemistry, certain brilliant hostels. And I top of that, we're always bumping against the zoo family's house, the woods, camp beds, mattresses, baskets, these the zoo, if you weren't careful with the excuse that they were a large family, and begin, act as if they were the only ones in the world. They even wanted to hang lines across our point to try their wash. The other said also wrong, this is just to begin by calling them immigrants. In the pretext that, since the others have been here first, this is used at top of late. This was mere unfounded pressure. The staff seems obvious, because neither before nor after exist, there are any place to immigrate from. If they were those who insisted that the cast of the immigrant could be under. stood in the abstract outside of space and time. There was what you might call a narrow-minded attitude, but I'll look at that time. Very petty. The fault of the environment which we have been reared. An attitude that basically is remaining all of us, Mariji, keeps cropping up even today. It's two of us happened to meet at the bus stop in a movie house at an international tennis convention. Remember this thing about the old days. Say hello. time somebody recognize me, but at times I recognize somebody. We probably started asking about this one and that one. We're going to teach them not to be on a few of those who remember the others. And so we started again, I think, with the students to slander with integrations. Till somebody who mentions this is fake. Every conversation finally gets around it. And all of a sudden the pettiness put aside. We feel uplifted with a bliss generous emotion. This is pink. The only one that none of us has forgotten, we all are friends. We're shianded up. I have long since stopped looking for her. This is pink. Her bosom, her thighs, her orange dressing gown. We'll never meet her again, this system of galaxies, any other. Let me make one thing clear. This theory that the universe, after having reached the ends of thisему to zero section. This, as his text Bana will never meet against again as never to this. And yet many of us are counting on me on that. Continually making plans for the time all me back there. Last month I went far here on the corner. I didn't do that. Mr. Paburp, Burr. What's new with you? How do you happen to be in this name? I learned that he's the agent for a plastics firm. Pop. He's the same as ever. This silver tooth is loud suspenders. Let me go back. I said, this man, he has to make sure this is his time. Sir, he may have to love me. Those are the suits. Would have liked to answer it by saying, I've read a number of people make the same mark, and really,  who I am. Mr. Poo, Poo. To avoid the subject, I hate some to say, what about this fake? You think we'll find her back there again? I, yes, she could not believe he said. Here. For all of us, the hope of returning to that point means above all, the hope of being once more with Mrs. Faint. It's a blaze of me, though I don't need. And in that bar, it always happens that Felder talking about her, and we're moved. Even Mr. Burr burrs unpleasant this fate, face of the eye. Mrs. Faint's great secret is that she never aroused any jealousy or any gossip you've asked of you. In fact, as she went to bed with her friend, Mr. Deswaw, as well, no. But at a point, if there's a bed, it takes a whole point. So it isn't a question of going to bed, but of being, is anybody in the point is also in the bed. Toss quietly was an habit of only she should be at bed, also with each of us. She had been another person there, telling all the things in the center of the other. It was a cleaning, all the started the slander. The others didn't have any coax to imitar. Subjective. the zoo family for a change. Horrible things we have to hear. Father, daughter, his brother, sister, his mother, and his nobody showed any hesitation even before the sinister assassination. With her it was difficult. Happen this side arrived from her and was the joy of being conceived. Pocked before. In her. And if protecting her, pocked before, you need. It was at the same time vicious contemplation thanks to the promiscuity of the Pocked before and also chastity given her a popular form of negativity. The short, what more can I ask? And all of this, which was true of me, was also true for each of the others. And for her, she contained and was contained with equal happiness, and she welcomed us and loved us, and inhabited all equal. You've got along so well, Altagre. So well, it's something extraordinary, it's bound to happen. He was a doctor to say, a certain moment. Oh, I only had some room, I went to my sleeping place, and in that moment, we all thought of the space that around us were out to the ground. We were in the back where it had forwarded the road, and we were able to do it. There was a mean with a great amount of flour, and it's cluttered the right forward, of her arms, and needed a needed,  shining with oil up to the elbows. We started. the space of the flower would have to come in. In the wheat of the flower, and the fields to raise them, in the mountains from which the water was flowed to irrigate the fields, and the grazing lasts for the purves of calves that would give their meat for the sails. The space it would take for the sun to arrive with its rays to ripe the wheat. The space for the sun to commence from the clouds of stellar gases of hern, of the quantities of stars and galaxies in the lactic masses and flight through space, which would be needed to also spend every galaxy. every nabula, every sun, every plant. The same time we caught him. This space was inevitable before. The same time that Mrs. Fig was uttering those words, I'm who with noodles boys, I point the container. All of us was expanding in a halo of distance in lighteners and light centuries and billions of light millennia. And we were being furled in four corners of the universe to the verb burr all the way to pop. all of them to, I don't know, what kind of energy life he'd...she...this is thing. She's been the midst of our closed, petty world, capable of terrorist impulse.
