  "text": "the B.B. Zishpado, it's a American life of my records. It's very, very bringing you today. It's kind of a past mystery story. It's got a question mystery at the very particular time. It's a real life party voice story. Maybe an episode of Scooby Doo. There's an old abandoned house, some kid stumbled upon it, they decide to break in. And then at that point, they kind of hit the jackpot, kid-wise. The place is filled, and I mean filled, fascinating stuff. It's also creepy and mysterious. And all kinds of people. and to realize and clues about what happened there. We sit aside to uncover, and we'll take care of the decades. We are devoting our entire show today to this one story, the house near a green light. First broadcasts show in 2001. We'll collaborate now as you hear this, and we'll be able to drive ahead of you, so you can stay tuned, figure it out, and tonight, make it to turn down lights. Add a backman, Nelson. He was my brothers, I did, and good-out, and the late. But... an M8 firecracker and we wanted to detonate in the shallow water where we used to swim. We were 11 and it was late fall of 1977. We were visiting a place called Freedom New Hampshire, a small town of a few hundred people just across the border from Maine . My dad had volunteered to do some maintenance work in the summer camp I'd once gone to. My brother Kenny, best friend of Ian and I went along. We'd been inseparable from growing up, but now I came in and started hanging out with an older crowd and I've been seeing less and less. of Ian since I just transferred to New School. I was in a funk about losing touch with Kenny Aliam, and so for me the stakes for the weekend were a little higher than usual. In normal times, you'd  to go shoplifting or set things on fire. That Halloween you take the cans of W40 and gone from door to door, spraying at the mouth of jack-o-end and still flanes burst out their eyes and they blew up and balls of fire. This is my brother, Kenny. He's now 37 who is a scientist. I think Ian's mom. , he's still worried a little bit about his spending to fetch the time with us or being brother and to our bad influence because I think we taught him about, , , throwing wood chips at cars and then taught him about unfolding paper clips and shooting and people and so on. So we were wandering around looking for something to do in the south house. It was great, weathered, and we were precariously up on end. So when this report is up, meh. side. Two old cars probably from the 30s sat in the yard. One of them had a tree growing up through a hole where the ones had been in. At the back of the house, we found the window that was broken and I remember appearing in into my darkness. I almost kind of a dare-car. That's my friend Ian. There was one of these things where we just would say, , I'm going to our house. Wouldn't you? The new saying, I have no call for that house and can you would say, yeah, that house looks fine. None of us really wanted to go back. Ha ha, there's a lot of scared. But we did. He was the skiniest, so it was decided that he should go in first. He slid sideways through the broken poles so he wouldn't get cut and disappeared. After made him ten seconds, he scrambled back out, clutching in newspaper. It was brown and I remembered crumbled in our hands. The headlines had something about Nazis invading. That was all mean. One by one we climbed into the house. It was dark inside. The only bite came into a little cracks between the boards that covered the windows. The floor felt soft underfoot, and as my eyes adjusted, I could see that it was covered with a layer of filthy clothes. Tunk was everywhere. Actually, we couldn't walk around on the floor because we could see the floor in these places. It was just shand, more stuff than you could live with. So remember there were a couple of rooms you couldn't go into for how much stuff was chand-in. I was careful to remember how we got in. and this way to find our way out and hurt. We were all very quiet. We've seen in our form and you see those that joking around to get us into trouble. Here's the end. We did not spread out. The stuck problem was you almost hit the hit. Our bash, we were the other. And Ken was making it look even the other way. His back was cut each other. So critters are  a star of people walking in the house. And Kenny is , one of the most worst people to be able to do a situation that was Two hours later. He's very good at it. Because he's very jittered. And he always will kind of mumble about maybe with the worst thing. But that might be an extra happen. , , , , I've got somebody's coming to come out of that closet. See you now, thanks. Some rooms were in total of the terrain. Things turned about. They've been rubbished too. But then they were in the slither areas where things were untouched. Things were untouched. In the kitchen, dishes were stacked on open shelves, awesome pans, cluttered the sink, and the pantry was stocked with canned food. I picked up a container of her she's syrup, and it felt heavy. A salt and pepper shaker sat on kitchen panel. The name since I had was of disaster. This is my brother Ken. As if people had been kind of tuteling along in their everyday lives, and something terrible happens, something kind of stuff. in the house. So catastrophic that no care have been put in arranging or sorting or editing any of the contents of the lives. And there was a feeling as we sat there that this timecast will happen that opened in the 60 years. And in catching the front of the calendars that give out a cast space. It was dated December 1938. In the bedroom was a pile of shoes, maybe thirty-high, that it's used into one mass. On an eight-stand, I found a pair of eyeglasses folded on top of men's wallet, and I slipped them both into my jacket pocket. In another room was a bureau, and tucked in the earframe was an invitation to a dance that could tell him all. Pintuette was a rose that was comfortable with it. Many opened the closet door next to the dresser, and hang there was a rotting white. dress. We began to have a bit of a scene that he managed to order returned slate from the dance with a rose, she pins it to the mirror and hangs her dress in the closet. And then something horrible happens when that's when time stopped. Outside, the spinning in the bright daylight, we race back to the town, came in with jets and fights... But I had this sense of doing about the whole thing. I heard about the key in Tutton's evidence during the country. I wondered if we could curse  the guys who found key in Tut's team. Also, I had someone's wallet in my pocket. I took it out and showed him the me in. Inside it was a great green $1 bill, made it $195, and a driver's license for a man named Virgil Mason. Second rate for perfumes. That night For my dad drove his home, I put on the eyeglasses I found to make Kenny in the end last, but then I felt bad about the joke. I didn't know anyone he died before. Now I was pretty sure I was carrying Wall in the dead man. The next day my brother would be going back to his high school buddies, where my best friend would be going back to a school, I'd have to face the kids in my new school, where I hadn't made new friends and it seemed  everyone was named Doug and played for the cross. I'd always been a mean kid, but it was an unfocused sort of meanness. Now that all this was happening in my life, my gloominess to economy focused, I brewed about the Mason House. My home room teacher had been an instructor for outward bound, throughout the year he made us go solo and woods around the school. I spent hours sitting out there, alone with my journal on a flashlight, brewed him. and the only exercise effort was grade 7. That spring, my parents went back to their volunteer state at the camp. This time I brought a new friend, named David. I knew it would impress him. We got up early and packed flashlights in our book bags, and I think we even brought a canteen of water. It was raining as we climbed through the window of the house. Nothing looked  it had changed in the winter, and just  the first time, I had to keep feeling the food washed and we moved from where to live. I think there is open outdoors. I mean I think. I remember walking through some of these dark rooms. Look at me around. , being afraid of perhaps not uncovering something. Some evil scene was discovering that they were there, just going to die there. I'm not sure if they were there. I'm not sure if they were there. I'm not sure. thinking that we were kind of finding, embodying closet in the moment. I mean, I remember there are some some cloths covered, we just flat out, didn't want open. We're even open up, I'll just just afraid it might find something just didn't want to see. Do you remember, Facebook? I don't remember that, no, I don't remember the basement. Did we ever go down? down. We did go down into the base for the last eight days. I still don't know the base. Did you go down the eating go to the base? We never went into the base. And here's why. The door to it had been blocked shut by a couch that is popped on its end. As if someone wanted to keep something down there from getting out. I remember uncovering funny small doll. His face had been burned off. And I remember being terrifying that. Thinking this must have been some scene of some horrible ritual. David has a really strong memory of a doll that's faced her and doll. No, no, no, no. Oh yeah, absolutely. That was scary. The limiting mention of it got to the image of it. There's something so creepy about a doll that's kind of... The mangled. I remember discovering that there was East Sea's area, , or near, there was, I know, animal and humaner, we couldn't figure that out. The coop on the bed, that was scary too. It would make me wonder, what the hell is going on? I think at the time with others, you needed to go across the country or so. That's in the whole story, but... know. Some, some, some fugitive on the lands from justice who's hiding out in a band of houses. The town out the hall of these to crash out there after a binge of mud dust. The strange part is the people pick up and walk out of front door one day and leave with letters that are. These were important artifacts, their family. If they did it for some of the gene trees, I can move. You pack up and move. You don't leave things  a wall of the marina or your address book that has the birth asri of your family members. Why do you leave them? How could you? We had a mission. The mission was to find out as much as we could about the family could live there. And all over the country with letters. He's a paper. And each one was a potential close. So, , he sat down in his dinghy and a musky house and he started to read. November 29, 1933. Deer Mr. Nason. I've checked up your case quite thoroughly and find you have already had as much as not more. the most people. I find also that you are working a car in the truck and that your son has a car in a truck. Also that your team is working in a hot-and-cut member. So long as a man has anything at all, he has to use it as we have to get work to the people who have nothing at all. Under these circumstances, you do not qualify for work at this time. Sign the office of the County Supervisor of Overseas. Dear mama, I'm staying overnight and go to the dance. Artina and have a fine. Keep things going up. I'm over to the dance and bring my shoes, the Blacks by points. After moving on to the moment and don't be mad, don't even tell P.T. Then mom, please don't be mad at me. Mr. Jackson is up to me today. Be sure you get that under the dance. There's all games tonight. Over the next two years, I returned to the missing house four times in all. Each time I came back with more clues about what happened. I read these letters over and over, trying to decode them, convinced that the answer about the families downfall was hidden in some seeming intrivial comment or odd-hand reference. This note is written on school paper by a young girl who's probably my age at the time. Dear Clyde, I wanted a boyfriend, so I thought it would break to you, darling. There's no other boy around here that it just smears you do by dumb. calling up my darling when I saw you last night over at things that I would go crazy because I love you so from your girlfriend you do. We have to take things that could help us unravel the puzzle. I mean I don't think we even saw it being private property at the start and because. It was just abandoned and no one cared about it. We read notes from doctors and found bills from predators. We stand library past denotes and studied postmunks. We came up with lots of ideas about why the place it left. We started thinking, maybe these people had their house for clothes and their thrown out behind bankers. Because it doesn't mean that if somebody might have been shut out of the house, with all of the objects inside. One might favor the race. was that, , father died at the same time, sons would be good at war. The fruit would be the papers and talking about war starting and things about how a couple of events with an old father and a couple of sons could very quickly finish the sand. I remember finding information about bedding. I think we saw, I think they were tickets and we were a schedule with a dog track room. or race track. The story we made up was, oh these people had lost all their money gambit. You need to find someone to get a silencer. A person who needs a family or a distant relative. You need to find someone to get a silencer. A person who needs a family or a distant relative. You need to find someone to get a silencer. Someone must have known what had happened. But when we go last, down at the general store or the post office, people gave us the cold shoulder. This confirmed to us that they were part of the conspiracy to bring this family. down, or at least part of the cover up. In retrospect, I realized that you'd also may have brushed a sock because we were 12 years old. It was David with how the break-up proved, a matchbook, matches intact, soiled, but magical. It said, stop and chop at me some grocery, feed him side near after him false bridge. We wrote over in ditched our bikes under the bridge. There were two or three houses on either side. all big old Victorian buildings, but it was obvious to us which one was the nasum grocery. There were a couple of ancient gas pumps outside and arresting moxie sodasign. A rope helped to do a close, but we were able to squeeze through. The first thing I saw when we went through the door, for the boxes of corn flakes, survived the walls. The nasum grocery was a completely intact, perfectly preserved store from the 1960s. We products still are the shelves. By the cash register, the Romaggi Z rack. the Rose of Candle. There were glass countertops displaying fishing gear, the stacks of cambeds, chickens, and green dunes. Some of the cans had exploded from years of human cuisine, which we thought was cool. Upstairs there were a few rooms that must have been in the apartment. Being in a store all of the sudden reminded us, , we're breaking an entering in a place that's got to be candid. There was a small safe under the counter. And when I turned the handle, the horse won't open. The handle was one open. Inside it, I found four silver dollars in two-candy half dollars. I also found five dollar gold for me, two-nine-two. I took the coins. I spent the eighth grade kind of detached from school. I stare after window at the falling stone, and think about the dress that must have been blowing through cracks in the house. I'm going to buy a wake at night, and imagine I was still in cold at the doing there. Instead of being homework, I spent a lot of time reading through my box of nasum letters, drawing up a family tree from the Blue Zoo town. Every reference to a hand-chry became relevant to the mystery. I'd sit at breakfast and stare at a tin of maple syrup and think about the nasums. I was pretty sure that through some way I could support a family researching abandoned houses that it would be my vocation advice. I was 13 years old when I had a crush on a house. I hadn't told my parents much about it, I was afraid they'd shut us down over fears we'd get hurt or arrested. But I remember feeling that I wanted grown up to see it, to confirm that we hadn't imagined the whole thing. So I started to tell my mother about it, but I could see I wasn't getting across Hellmaysia once. So that's spring, I lived my mother across the field of weeds, and watched as she climbs through the window. house. I was the one part, one on the side it was much more and much greater disaster than I imagined, also much greater mysteries than I had imagined. And in many ways much more interesting. My mom proved him quite a thief. She drove me to the town cemetery where we found upon a plot of nascent graves. There was either nascent, died 1943. died 1968, virtual, who's dollar bill and driver's license I had died 1974, and Jesse, died 1969. There was another Jesse William who had a birth date, but there was no date of death. So our theories of a car carrying the whole family of the war, a sudden plague, of the whole town rising up against the nations in massacre him. These no longer made sense. Whatever a driven the family from its home hadn't been sudden. The circumstances. senses were more complicated than anything I'd imagined. That winter I had my first nightmare. I was in the house, rummaging two things, and the naces were there in the walls, watching and they worked finally. The next year I didn't go to your hamster. I'd started high school and was finally making friends. There was less booding. my life and what breeding was left had to do with girls. My mother went up on a semi-annual work weekend with the summer camp and she brought my sister along. When they returned they told me the story that they'd buy blood on cold. Tell me about the time that you went up with Claire one hour. That was a big mistake. I think we were both very embarrassed. We were embarrassed. We were both very embarrassed. Yeah. I felt I was angry. You were angry? I was. Now we blew it, we blew it, so that's it. What happened was this? My mother had brought my sister into the house and they'd seen a child's crib brought him away in the attic and they decided to take it. So they drove my family's bright orange, Volvo station wagon up in front and went into the crib. There was no way one could bring that crib down the stairs. And while your apartment's ropes and where, time to go, we lowered it down. When? Outside the window. Yeah. Outside the house. Hmm. Right. I'm not sleepy. Hmm. If boy walked by and stopped, we saw him seat. We saw him seat. And we saw his seat. And we saw his. The boy returned with two women who told my mother and sister they had no right being in the house. My mom argued asking them why if someone somewhere had an interest in the property. They were letting it rock. The woman said it was none of her business and that she'd better leave. I felt betrayed. To see my mother and described the orange car, the dangling crib, the confrontation in the middle of the road. People in freedom had a word for greedy city folk from Massachusetts and smells for who came to town, flundering grandteas. They called them massholes. That's what we become and I felt sick about it. I collected all the objects and letters I found and put them in a small wooden fish-tacken box. I found it. in the nays and grocery store. I tucked the box up in our attic and I never went to the nays and house again. Threat years later, I took a trip through New England with William, and we decided to take a detour to freedom. I stopped the car where I thought the house stood, and remembered it being further along, so we parked and walked up and down the road. But the house was gone. All the remain was outlined at the foundation in the dirt. We drove through the bridge to see if the store was there, but no problem. it wasn't. You couldn't tell if the buildings had been torn down or if they burned. They were gone as well as I thought any answer I'd ever get as to why they'd been left in the first place. I was having the nightmare regular of me now. Each time it was the same. I was in the nascent house of some version of it. But now undead nases were leaving their hiding places and walls in attack area. It was a terrifying dream and I had it many times of them twice years. So there's plenty in here. This summer I went to visit my mother and looked to the box of things I saved from the nascent house. All the years I'd spent away from home she kept the box carefully labeled and stored through form rooms. -huh, yeah, I remember it. Yes, they wouldn't wash, see that's the wooden box that I remember and I think it has things in it. Shit. The box was as I'd left it, a little makeup case with powder still inside the eye glasses, some children's records and recordings, photographs of the family, the letters, and their newspapers. Right on top is the one e-in-found that very first day. This newspaper is very old. Boston's son-making. After-m... watching, watching into the rest of Chippus La Valle and March, Little Inchamel and the next change is just not to stay there. Inchamel and said he mustn't do it again. April 16, 1939. And my grandparents were already in the minutes of because of this taking marriage. When my great grandparent fled their home in Czechoslovakia, they'd let furniture, paintings, letters, all very sudden, never returned. My mother tells me that all those things probably still exist somewhere. Without in mind, she couldn't bear to see the nascent things running away  they had. When years soon... It's all very now, calling those little, small eyes and mouth. Yes, fand? You're banning it is not a problem. Your way is worse is for a more electrical class. I can understand one sound that you need to watch this video on a ban that nobody else that it was so overwhelming and I have it that nobody had to choose all of something to resolve something that was very sensitive. That was  him. anything a corpse can do this corpses that's a little bit defeated in the eye. But here was a carcass, a carcass of a house of a life that I'd  to know but care to beat it up and did it with all the blame. I thought that it was important to some magicians. Let's somehow. Somebody was leaning over this world, , really unfolding these lives. That somebody was wrong to God. And it really didn't matter that it was an 11-number one, you care. Objects have lives, they are witnessed the things. And these objects were  that. So always in a way glad that you were listening. There was one letter in particular that my mother and I couldn't get out of our heads. It was different from the others, and I kept it separate. In a plastic-sip lock bag, it was milled and barely legible. 8.8.9.9. Letconia pass. My down, excuse writing, it's the best pattern. Natch. They brought me to the hospital here Tuesday night. at 830. The baby was born prematurely at 3. yesterday afternoon. I am writing to you, writing for you before I need. What are we going to do? I'm the old crazy. Did you get my $2.00 a while today? Then with no padding myself, I have all the green them up, you decide Let me get�er early and that's what I'm going to do. 50 cents. I am weak, you can't write more. Very, I need that. But I love you more than ever. I registered here as your wife. I knew it would be them. With all my heart and heart from quick I am the line of one, two, three, four, four, six. I can't write. I can understand that her thought of her soul also. I've read the world for her. I've worried about the kid. I've never forgotten this. I remember finding that. I didn't you explain to me what it was about. I don't think I understood. That coming New York, I started doing research on the internet, working off of this tip-nacen names I found in the cemetery. Eventually I found this posting in a genealogy website. Nacens and feeding new handsherb, looking for relatives of Jesse Nacen and his wife birth up. Any info from their kids or grandkids and pictures would be awesome. They are my great, great grandkids. The person who read Nacens. named Samantha Thurston. I sent her an email confessing everything and this is what she wrote back. Hello Adam, I'm very interested in what you found and almost wish you take and all that you found. Jesse and birth are my great great grandparents. I don't know a lot about them but they did have a store in three to the mansion and move well-known. These changed a few more emails and made plans to me. Samantha said the immediate family either didn't have many answers or didn't want to talk. Her last email to me included this cryptic. They might not be what you'd expect. They were a rough crowd. The line is followed with three exclamation quotes. Coming up, one of the rough crowds meets one of the net-een kids. In a minute, we'll talk about the video. One of the problems we've seen. It's a smack knife, man. Class, we're dividing our entire show today to just one story. The entire show later just wants to wait. real life in the story, a house near Moonlight, and for his broadcast today's show in 2001, Adam Beckham, his name is his town. In August, I drive north to New Hampshire to meet the SNF first in the form of the internet, and see if I can find someone to talk to me about the nascent. I brought the box of nascent stuff with me, it's small, about a foot square, inside her family letters and coins that took from the grocery store, the kind of Hershey syrup on nascent's kitchen. someone who cares about the stuff. If not, I've planned to bury it on the spot by the house. As the turnoff from the 25, the Tegu short bypass called Nacing Road. On the way into town, I stopped to get directions from a woman working with her front yard. She's wearing a sweatshirt that says Nacing Lane's statement. Samantha had told me that for Nacing's and couldn't know what it happened at the house, or didn't want to talk. She also said that everyone knew I was in town. It's hard not to give an error on me. Here I am, an outsider from New York City, come to town with details about the past, being around some more details. I'm happy to answer you about what kind of reception it gets. How can I be? How can I be? How can I be? How can I be? How can I be? How can I be? How can I be? I ride in Freedom August 2nd and I pray to this march in through the center of town. It's old homeweek, the annual homecoming festival, an event created by Governor and the map problems of abandoned homes and farms in New Hampshire. all the way back in 1898. After the Civil War, young people have left the state and drove for better land and opportunities they've done as elsewhere. I'd last visited in the 1970s, and a few things have changed since. The town's only store has been replaced with a shop for tourists, the sound tidorialies, and it cans and being days. Farming is pretty much dead. In city people have moved in because they love how charmulums. The place is so self-consciously played that you feel you're on movies. about a small town. Tidy, with just enough dilapidation around the edges to be rustling. The parade moves past the old town hall, for one shop, across the town's only intersection to the cemetery, then turns around for another pass. The theme for the parade this year is, we are freedom. When I marched in the parade's kid, the theme was freedom of the press. I dressed as rage. important and pretend to introduce spectators. And I really so bizarre I don't remember what else to say about it. That afternoon I checked with the only place to stay in town. A bed and breakfast called the Freedom House. I've been concerned that some distant relative of the nation's might own it. Part of the rough crowd. the owner's new yorker, this princess die member of the Illuminant Library, to my room's supposed to break. In fact, it's called the Uvalon, as to keep the Paris Sea of Cayman, it's a new law law, but any of the patrikbili is part of the new breed in freedom. In the five years he's lived here, he's had to be in the meticulous name of St. George. Anti-coilitories and bottles and talcum powder lined to shelves of the water and on a hallway table, silk gloves rest on top of a purse, next to a pair of opera glasses. His things are just  this stuff in my box of nasum lignets and in better quality. Standing there with the dirty little wooden box under my arms, I feel sort of pathetic. And what Patrick starts talking about how people can create instant ancestors out of old jugs. It doesn't make me feel any better. I've pieced together histories with photos. We've come up with photographs I have. The number of instant ancestors in this house that I'm kind of to create nyambiots. , on a few instances I try to trace whatever I put about. Patrick's learned a lot about the history of the town, so I asked him about the nasi house. He doesn't know anything about it, but he does say that an nasi cousin named Rachel Mowldo once owned this very building, and that she lived here and died here. I think Rachel's so, I've had a few guests from the nasi house in the second floor, so I don't know the chill here, but I've heard people down at the end of the station. So I've ended up, she was a little old lady, so, I'm not sure. little,  a slippery seat, and have a few things with lights, my balls, seven, and great. I have a couple of days to kill before my meeting with Samantha, and it breakfast, Patrick suggests I talk to a few locals who might have known the nascent family. The first one on his list was right across the street. Where my name isscale. I'm gonna next red. I came here at the age of six months. There's, and have spent most of my summers here. What else would you  to know? Do you remember, do you remember the name of this? Oh, crap. Scruffing little kids. They were always kind of disheveled and half-gress, needing to be washed. They were, how real. You didn't call on the University but the one you're on... Cross in the covered wagons, and that's the school. Well, I guess maybe they did go to school. They were fair. They were sort of scary to go in my there. We walked to the beach. We were pretty fast to get find that house. What? No. Not mine. I think to sign your number. down for practice session. What was there status in the town where they moved out? I don't know anything about that. And I moved no whole family set up, but they're one of them using the race horses. And they quite a lot of money and thinking race horses. I asked him if he's financial hardship or anything. But he can't confirm anything. About 1940 something, they built a bypass so that the name 25 to 0.5 to 0.5. And then the town began to die out. So he's come to town and then the stores lost business. And they began to close up on the one. I have no idea. I knew it, that's what he hit that finger. But there may be somebody around. No. Nice. So, well, that's good. Carol Chase was the fire chief in Sweden about the time the house was burned. And if I'm sitting on his porch on a road outside of town, he's 92 years old and hard at hearing, but he does remember fire. He just let it go. Let's go. No, it's paper, no matter. Who's house empty or who's full stuff? Now my little day. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why, why wanted that? You want it, man? You want it, man? Leave it long. That's it, that's it, that's all I know, I'm hungry. They put one there on the... He looks away from me as he says this and I take him home. Later that day, I learned he's related to the nations by marriage. In fact, he's cement his grandpa. I spent some time worrying over why he never mentioned this. That afternoon, I got a good joke shop on the outskirts of town. This guy... the appliances, clothing, and these surprising number-world families' photos. The owner John Woodard salvages most of this stuff from traumatic molos and deepest lives and divorce or death, or an enumer from a house to a retirement home . As it turns out, back in the mid-Settling woods, you've got to call it out to nascent house. So get ready and knock down at house. You gotta call me up, so get to the other smaller stuff, just boxes of old, wiss and bottles with paper labels and all the stuff in there. I got 10 or 12 boxes, , I sold them over the years. Do you remember if there's anything in here that you got from the house, then is there? Yes. I still got some. You have labels. Yes. One more squad. This is a big one. It's done, lots of me out past Isles and discarded family possessions to a barn filled with hundreds of bottles. Yes, see,  something  this. Pick with your bottle. öl- Further. I take my pick, I get a bottle of water from the nasi house and use it all from college. It was the one round I had kept for myself when I packed up the nasi and stuff. These are upstairs. There are upstairs and some boxes. Of course, the roof is falling apart. It's the other. The upstairs was one of those you said. It really worked. It really worked. It took me a few minutes to get my boxes down from upstairs. But we did. John holds it to me. He's got the same hair of rust on it that everything he made from house had. This is $5. He gives it to me for free for my project, his name is. I'm supposed to meet Samantha in my internet-mason contact at the B&B at Waclaw, and she shows up 15 minutes early. A red pickup chart here. There's into the lot in the cloud of dust and a top-looking woman in a flower print dress gets out of these slams to the door. Samantha's young in her 20s. She's made up, her tie-backing and bow, but her demeanor's all convoying. Well, I talked to the family yesterday to actually have an Aileen. He's the one that implodes us to have a little fear. We talk and it's  we've been living in parallel worlds. Samantha's been looking for clues about the family's history for 10 years. She tells me she's been sparing baby arts and reading to public cracks. She began her search when she heard rumors that she had native American ancestry. She decided to find out if she did to get financial aid from college. Before the longest and figured out her grandfather was, in fact, the illegitimate child of Ernest Nason, one of birthing ingestus kids. Although her grandfather was not the person that mattered by mom who remembered all of his years. And, now a lot of high films he had planned as it is. And, in his family, hearing what she was uncovering, wasn't too keen. on her research project and didn't cooperate. No, and it was , go to hell away. I don't want to talk to you about this. It's not a business. Well, it is. It's my heritage, it's my history. Yeah. I left my box of stuff from Mason House upstairs in the U.M. Olin. I wanted to give to someone in families, but I wanted to be sure to go to some of the camp. As we talk, it becomes clear to me how much of a game to see happen. So I bring it down and put it on the floor and fire . How do I get this home? It opens up. Oh my goodness, she even got papers. Oh wow. Yeah, that was probably one of the first things you found in that. Oh my goodness. Ain't that neat? I can't believe this is unbelievable. You have no idea what was she doing? She opens the netbook with her great, great friend when I was home, held it none. She handles incredible jumps. watch the shit that's the content is falling to her hands. It's a bunch of tiny recipes put out for a newspaper. what? I never even know what. So much loss. I hope they appreciate it as much. They really do. It's actually a blessing that you had gone into the house during that time because once it fell and everything was screwed up so I jumped back into the house. And all the memories, everything fell. I'm sure to have been dived up so I could have passed out. It's all lost. So it actually was a good thing that she would know as you would have bought. It actually was a good thing that she would know as you would have bought. Samantha didn't know much about why the reason house was abandoned. But she told me the man in David Buswell who was across the street from where it once stood, might have some answers. On the way up to his house. notice the sign. Stress pastors will be shot. Survivors will be shot twice. David sitting on his front porch with his friend, Mabel Davis. How does it happen to you and to know about the nation? Well, I was a little boy when I was about 11 years old. I was in the summer camp. Once we get talkers, I realized the trespass in sign is David's idea in joke. It's Sunday afternoon, and they're drinking mudslides. Do you remember that? Of course I do want to. The name that many times. When the naces were living there? Yep, naces were in the situation, they lived in there. And I can see naces in the wall, taking out a dam of biscuits, almost a grub of that dam. Bables arms are spread wide as she says this. The image is pure Norman Rockwell, and frankly, it's really... And what were the naces ? But they were one of the people... How would you say about Jess? All of his kids worked on work. Both maybe when dated Lou the Mason and had been in their house. But dated,  me, had only been inside after it was him. Ah, it's full of traces. Both Halisats, Morris Chairs, advertising channels, , patients just packed with stuff  that. Leave a pack bag and where they collected him. Yeah. Why would they just don't ask me just the way they were? I think the grandkids want us done. No. No. You're not young people out there don't care about all things today. David made a tone that birthed in 1968 in Jesse's scene after in 69. And then things fell apart in the nascent family. When... when just die. One of the church was in charge. He was named the... He was your... He was your... Yes, obviously. And there was some that were very, very proud of me. So he cried that they had to sign up and give him the authority to dispose of them. Some of them were not there. No, no. Not that is correct. It's a terrible thing to say. But there's a guide of one by one by one. And it... It's made it easier, but it wasn't even settled when this person who was in charge of the state, he had died and still, of his left. And then the widow was paying the tax in the office years. And she said, but I'm not going to continue paying the tax in the office. I mean, there's I think you were one or two of the families left and they didn't want to pay them. So she said, the heck, I'm not going to sell the town, but the tax is. I finally went to town and I said, , and so far it has it. I built it in half the year. People were really pouring around. I said they could step on a nail or glass or wire and soon you stopped post it. So I said it ought to be burned. I was at my daughters and I was in her kitchen. The day they were burning. We could see the flames and everything. Oh yeah. I remember the fire's fire coming in very near. I communicated with Mr. Trump. He said to me at the time, you were arranged with the fire bomb. To burn it out of practice such a session, and I would give him a thousand dollar donation. To get it. And I said, thank God, because it was a nice, so, and people were in and out of it all the time, was it still full of self-awareness? There was a lot of junk in there. Yeah. Now in the nations, I'll have a story in F.E.E. and F.E.E. There was a old... Oh yes, in the third minute. Yes. And there is a store right in the room. No, it was still free there. What do you remember about the store? Well, I know it did quite a business. So there was a lot of beer. And they had candy. And they were saying that. Okay, so if you're going to be able to do this, you can have to get a lot of count as well. Yeah. That would just be  that just they just had a lot of stuff. No, he was a keeper. I've never seen him. Do you remember when he closed? They both did that. And now the taste won't do run in. I would have family leave all their things. These precious things. Not not not a value for a brain. No, no. I don't send a mental value. Yeah. , I've never really thought of that. It seems rather tragic and new. I mean, that was a lie for me. I mean, how well do  people? How many of them were written? interested in... no. And so the house in the store of Rappandon, because the kids didn't care. In some ways, this was bleak or than anything I imagined back when I was 11. I assumed a murder or an accident caused the reasons to leave up his face behind. Something out of the family's control. But in fact it's the opposite. The family made it happen. They didn't care about the stuff Well, they just didn't care remember It should be as they weren't feet To tell them they were carrot, scramble Nice people but they were Reads had fun No They lived the old school Yeah, that's right They were They made everything do But didn't everybody there? Also good to all candidate when everything got money. Yes, I guess. I asked when you put them in the savings. From a car, you wouldn't have placed for a pony by that. Members of the nascent family who declined to be interviewed on tape and burned the story made in the day of Tolerary. Jesse and Berth and Nathan lived in the house until 1946. That's when we open the story you're at in the falls. Move to the... heart and above the store. They took with their needed and left the rest of the old house, using a storage and keep your open possibility that they moved back Sunday. When Jesse and birthday died, the fighter would be a state again. We needed their kids and nine of them, locked up the store until it was new-solve. The house stayed pretty much as it was. After eleven years, the fight was settled, the property was auctioned, the money was still, and the buildings were raised to the ground. I asked an older nation why they did. and if they were out, the precious things in the house, and she said, what precious things it was full of crap, and I need crap. As for the woman in the letter that my mother was never able to forget, knowing you anything about her or her baby. Dave and Abel told me, this just figures and you wouldn't tell my freedom. Are you kidding, honey? It's a fake place. There's plain words. Oh, just  every other town! Stop throwing it on what's Villa. Hey, equivett. Oh, spit it on the water! Well, that's been bedroom materials. No. Things so do have on Mike and Annie to have a call home. Right? It's all by gossip and... That's all. Yeah. In retrospect, I know it was a little much. My obsession with nasums is a kid. I found this stuff in their house, precious. So I soon be able to. But of course the relics in their house weren't about my life. They carried no memories, good or bad. It's possible that for the naces they were reminders of an inheritance dispute or other disputes that they just assumed forget. When I was talking to Mephan David about the naces in house, he told me this story. His wife's father had recently been suddenly died, left behind a house that no one in family wants. So David and his wife's shoes are now finding themselves involved in figuring out what to do with it. I feel  I've done the custom being abandoned, known as living there, , it's bright, fluving, vandalized, and what do you do with a house  that? And now it's strange, I mean, it's tied up in this weird world of people, probate. Where you can't really do anything with properly, you just kind of have to maintain it until some future court date. , you can probably become a ball in chain. And this is an interesting thing, is here up your house. I wish that house just burnt down. You see, gosh, well, why would you wish that house to be burned down? It's partly, , it's a lot of memories tied up in the house. The emotions tied up in her or the dad. And I'm blessed by the house. But something about the seed growl of it. wanted to show us the man from the spot where the house had been stirred, so when we were early evening we walked to town and onto a little lake road. We crashed through the bushes for a while hoping that we can find the old foundations for something that there wasn't a trace. In fact, the very land where I remember the house was gone. The soil had been hauled away, we squeezed the water by bulldozers, constructing part of the food林 elementary school. Yeah. I was also crazy. You didn't have a stone wall. Later, when I was packing to the town, I found a small scrap paper on the floor that had fallen out of the box of nascent stuff. There wasn't any writing on, but I actually hesitated to trash him. It's not that I missed my box of clues. I'd felt with these hand in the moment of Samantha. In fact, I actually felt later. But I was glad to have a remnant, however small of the maces. So I talked to scrapin' my bag. At a beckon, the news is we were squad cast in the story. At a mark, the cinematographer, co-directed for a television show, streaming many places on-on. Three of the people that had a new view to this story have died since the first day. El Hogan-Betford, one of the green locals, how chase from the car. of Chief and Mabel Davis who never talked to one friend's friend for you. I've progressed to this day by when he joined my self-adult school and worked John and Goldstein and Starry Kine, senior British and today's show is to his night of additional production help on rerun from the Coin Felgert Freud, Captain Ray Mondeau, Stone Nelson, Matthew.
