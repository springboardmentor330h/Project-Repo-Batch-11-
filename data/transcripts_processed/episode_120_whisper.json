In some point, her boss notices that Vielba does seem to have a crush on someone, and asked her about it. Here's what happens, this is actually the Shakespeare of 2012 night, said Mac. Vielba's boss, the Duke or Sino, asked if her eye, his phone, and Simmons, she loves. Vielba replies, but little by your favor, do you guess what kind of woman is it? There was always a position because it's a image of us. We're kind of a omniscient, she replies, of your complexion. She's not worth the time and says, for years and days. You're yours, my Lord. The nigga I want to talk about the woman that the Duke is in my room. His name is Olivia. It doesn't  you could offer. And the old attentively brings up the notion, what if there were some lady? And perhaps there is. Have for your love, greater paying apart as you have for Olivia. He repised that no woman could feel him as deeply as he feels for a video. And the woman has no one in his sad little moments when she feels this compulsion to came at her feelings for the dude. Without him understanding at all what she has given him. Because she's mad. She's the woman who can love his deeply as a man does. My father had a daughter left, as it might be perhaps where I a woman I should your go to share. So, did you cast that stuff? daughter of a father. What's her history? I blank my heart. She never told her about, but that concealment  the worm in the bud, feed on her to mask she, she climbed in thought in the green and yellow melon cover, she sat  patience to mine. Smiling. This is when things come to, she loves, but she's pretending to be someone she's not, so revives  this membrane, separating her from him, even though he's standing right there, she cannot tell him how she feels. The problem with... pretending is that you can just be too successful and someone will be and then you're stopped. And of course there's a second and a deeper danger that Shakespeare doesn't talk about 129. The real trouble that you can get into if you pretend that you're someone else is not that other people are going to believe. It's that you will start to believe that you're so. And then you're just looking at a dream,  you see so many public figures, senators who are so enamored with the idea that they. are in fact senators of the United States of America. Now they turn into these cartoon people. You look at them, you just get the feeling that they never have saved themselves. I am the senator. , they go man. And this happens all sorts of ways, large and small. People pretending all sorts of things. They feel things that don't really feel that they are things. They impact our not. Crazy people where they want to come to believe their own lives, their families, their jobs. W.B. EZ Chicago, Public Radio International, It's a American life, America. Each week on our group, choose a theme, and you were a variety of different kinds of stories on that in today's program. The capital here you pretend to be, we have three cautionary tales for you. Tech one, doing good by doing bad. What happens when a nice guy gets a job, where all day long, he's supposed to pretend that he's a son of a bitch, how does it affect him? Back to, psycho-babeled has to say. Jack hit Toss a true story of those innocent days back in the 70s and going to a church retreat meant Backrobes and encounter group sessions and role playing games And how he personally witnessed the role playing game to end all role playing games That's me What's the funny about peace of an understanding? Report a release speaker heads out with a group of mostly white suburbanites who were on a mission to understand the African-American slave experience I pretend to be African-American slaves Stay with us That's one, doing good by doing bad. What happens when you're pretending to be somebody horrible, every day, haven't changed you. Ron Copeland worked for a union for 27 years, left that work, and then he saw an ad in the paper calling for people who  children,  to teach history in an innovative way. And this led it to a job as a historical interpreter, Conopheri. living in the stream museum. That's how Indianapolis. Several months a year in this job, he pretends to be a slave owner in the old South. People come looking to experience the slave experience. He screams to them, the orders are around, treats them terribly. He talked about his job with the American Life Museum. It was very hard. First, we couldn't really scream at him and we didn't, it was not in our makeup to actually talk to the people in rough tones. voices. You had to develop over a period of time, so because sometimes it's time to yelling, but sometimes it actually means, especially when it's starting to be  people. So the very first time it's not very loud at all. I mean I said, , get down here. You have to get out here, you're down here right now. get on your hands and knees, get down here, front up, then the second time around it was, you slaves get down here, get down on your hands and knees. Start getting down here, put your eyes down. Two, two, be looking up at a man, white man. you're not supposed to be looking up at me? Get your eyes down on the ground, get down here. The harshest is, get down here today, get down here right now. Don't you be looking up at me, get down here right now. You really get in here. Let me see you! Tell love love and me! Are you looking up? Me! And what you want to do is you want to get their attention very quickly. Then you start working upon their emotions. You look for that little weakness in a person. If you find a weakness, then you start playing on their weakness. If you see a lady start batting her eyes and start flinching a little bit, you work on her. Tell me you go. keep for yourself. She's gonna be away from the rest of the group. They're gonna go on without her. She belongs to you. You put fear in her. Now, it may sound funny too, but it's  the military. The first thing they do in the military is the break you down. Let's back to you. That's what's the conclusion. No, I would watch for , you big ol' of fun. So that you got that onion breath and get rid of your trees. Because you want them to really feel you to send you. It's in the dark. But you get rid of your face and you get that black smell. And you breath and haul this, got it, breath. , there was a back away from you. More they back closer you get. I  to walk around behind them. Talk to you. They don't know which one they talked about. And you say, well that right there I think she'd be good for Braiden because she's a good guy. You stand behind three women. They're all standing there thinking, see Tom, is he making that remark about me? You're not making that in, you're saying it. But they don't know that. Or you get behind them, they can feel your behind them. They know you're back there, you've been sent to prison fact. Go. It puts me in the pinch. Anything you can do to scare the edge of the team, I slay them. You push. There was many nights when we first started the program that I was in the home and we were , wake all night. Because it's mostly in your head. This is wrong. You're doing something very wrong. Even though. You're trying to showcase me and make a real list of this job very much because it's not our nature act  that. You see somebody tear up, well I'm kind of a softening way. And it hurts me, , I'm a tough person. It was no the first year thing. It might go make that person a hard day. I'm learning, I don't have a problem here, . had a young girl, and I told her she's going to do this, and I screamed at her, and later get over the corner, and she's starting to cry. And I started going. I'm very hard at it. And I had to come out of it to a point of where I said, well, I used to scanning. , I don't think you can cook. You wouldn't be very good at all. I had to, , children's all this, and then to get out of there. But you thought we'll have that. So you'll walk out by. demonstrations, things  work. you want to go find that shoes all right, , because I know she's here. So get hers, get hers. Do you treat the blacks within treating whites? We try not. We try not. To what we try to do is we'll pick our blackers and pick on white. And we try it to give them equal to the same type. So we are lucky. But do you find yourself penetrating differently anyway? , I would say yes. You do. You do. You can't help from it. You can't help from food business, , but that's a little bit better than we were the white groups, because , with the problems we've had in the past, , for the relations. And where the people have been treated, , you don't know how you're going to push that person's fit. So you have a  really just  what do you? Oh yes all a black person might be  who's I've let loose and really call them stupid, ignorant  you're nothing but an animal you're just  a child I can't  I've got to teach you everything you're just  a little lamb you don't know what damn thing what are you stupid  and just keep in their face Cause You're talking about it in your mind. And what are you thinking about yourself? What on your mind? Inside. Inside. Your stomach is hurting. It's causing you to feel it's not. That's how little feeling you've got in your head. This is your not  this. Now have you ever had a problem in doing this? Where you are? You're not  this. You're not  this. I imagine myself, , or I can see how you disperse. Also, I've had a lot of my friends, I do that, I've had them who I see that I could have been that eight person disperse and he or its stupid in that room and that I could just that point at the incident both of us on the right and all of them had either the right path.. so that we could each other guess love. I have a black lady, and she was very defiant. The look on her face, the look at her eyes was a burning look. I mean, I'm up in the dark, and I can see that my expression. And I tried to make or do some of the things, and it was , she was going to probably be no matter what I've done. No matter how close I got to her, I mean, I got within the edge of her nose, my nose. And I'm squealing her, and I told her to look down. she would not back her eye. She would not even talk. I'll come to the point. Sam, tell you what's going to happen to you. I'm just going to kill you right here. Now do you care? She looked at me with those eyes named very person. She said, I guess she was going to kill me with this underdoin. And she just goes outside. were burning it. I was a slave by her. I would probably pull the gun up, try to write and bring it back. Because she had pushed my credit and then , I'm going to think that's right. That's not right. But that moment I would probably pull the gun. We've had some kind of things saying that they feel  we're going beyond that. That we actually get a kick of being sadistic. Which we don't. We don't. , I'm telling you that even when they interpret up their, it was his first time. He got into it so much. That's the problem, so we're good. actually doesn't say because it affects you then but it is physically set minute you go up people have their parents when you take off your costume you put on your sweet post to that side of the home you feel  fit in terms of the mother and children.

I'm so good at everything, I'm so much more effective than you have done. I'll get that. I'll go and set you everywhere, I'll get me cold. I still don't tell me, , I saw that this is so much. I replay the entire night, go over it, then do this right, and I do that now. and two meaningless person should hang and done this. So I sort of read a whole thing and then I tried to just find the evidence. It wasn't. I think you better soon to ban. I was, I was, no back office. But I would name it as a magazine. So I had not heard any of that. , so you serve this information. It's a myth. Do you ever feel now in the dream about the daily business of your life that you get set off? I scream at, I do little things. My wife says, I tend to talk a lot of that or it's more of a friend to help people to ask people and she said, I changed, I realized not right to use for the arms. back, I talk to people in the soft tone, , no, so something good, meaning, forceful. It may carry some more time. Try to be honest. What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? Do you ever think that you could be this much of a sin? No, never. Never, ever could. My wife said there was no way. Is that a ten, man. But are you not paring a teahouse? I'm just with aietion. Don't ever call the 하는데 a40. I don't have aальную alredy pain. Some other time then we may be cheaply hahaha. Just kidding, those things, he had to deal so anyhow. Don't ask what I do. Ya do ye. the clown, run it, lay up to cut up, , good night and I didn't do a deep play thing for deep. I was taking a very time to go back and start to be March with no grip, man. I'm just not going to be in the end. The spinning part I could do, the actual getting me, getting in place, getting the stair, getting in the room. So, does that tell you something about yourself? What actual情況 is he gunned. you to be concerned, it's just going to be good. Certainly you question yourself, what you are and what you thought you were. So you question yourself, I mean did I always say this week was I actually this way and snever came in before did I continue to be me? You think about it? A lot, even. It's good work. I don't know if I'm going to do this problem, I think for a month, I'll give this time, get away from the debt, and not go to the bank. Now we have to do this on the regular basis constantly. In my chains and moments, we can just look and... What we're making in the right now. Do you think that's a real danger that you're doing now? Oh, it's okay.

There's the pretending we do, individual with each of us at our jobs, with our families. And then there's also a kind of industry of pretending, includes a course production of stage plays and movies, and many different kinds of sales jobs we're pretending to  your customer and your products and the key to the job. And in the code's various kinds of group therapies, the role playing games that are used in certain clinical settings. When it comes to this last category, Jacket has been to get them out and talk, he has seen what they're used to see. And that's what this whole thing. If role playing had a hate thing, it was in the 70s and I was never had a precise peak a moment when it was the kind of transcendence after which all of the role plays and but pale wanted to role courses. I'd argue it was the performance of Mary Francis Leigh-Abo, the camps in Christach from the Sever End, the beginning of the 20th century. Is it happened? I'm scared to it. I come to you today. The backdrop, Vietnam War, Ladies and Christ and Pros, the growing clamor for Nixon's resignation, I was 17. Almost everyone I knew would need spell from school, but the terms. Extreme times called for extreme measures in the nation's image. An enthralled and wr ago up that meant on the new thing. Father Ralph Burr, Youth Needster. Right there in Charleston, there was a... even a group that was on the second story of sequence music that read it ruins. Love those kids that were left over there. I remember that voice. That was the ice cream farm. Yeah. Yeah it was a brothel. Yes. There's some of the depints that I'm there with. I found that later that the girls would be present the way it's later. Well some of children so much. I mean, that was just terribly frustrating. It was, I think something else. You mean having your daughter become a prostitute? Well, very frustrating. They didn't even know that. Most of the time, because they just saw that child having that home. Right. Later they would discover what was really going on to the course. But, as we discovered that parents were sufficiently frustrating and felt utterly unempowered. And they said, have I? Yeah, , they, I don't mean they have a question that I see even worse. Despite the wicked tongue, rough men will have understood my fears that they are married. There's something that's called nostalgia. How do you do it? Who else? In another game of convention, youth probably for the first time, which can mean it's 2000. Is it almost never mentioned that? Instead, you cannot submit the strategies in which you can. Using whatever encounters we do, visualizations, backgrounds, propositions, storytelling, lying on the floor and going fancy trips, blindfolded face exploration being set up. At the time we hit it up, it's so long to be in motion intimate one, and Ralph and given this line of action. I love going straight, it's not fun. Still to this day. We naturally meet each other. role playing. , would you think it's , boy cheats on the exam, it's called Adam, this is the scholarship that I have to ask. That's what I thought. Another one was, I stole stuff in Rollers and I got a blade. But now that we've got a big enough standing boy scout, something. So I know it's true. I don't know why you did that. Sure, sounds as, but then came the summer of 74. There was a two-week retreat in King Christopher, but almost immediately immediately in the evening. Someone still avoids Eballic in King Christopher's quail, and another voice knob. And then there was a racialist, acquired by the... The involved black, but overread upon the expression of Christian history. And a bunch of tough, upstate white, and that. We've other elite workin' and beast-loving looped literature threatened to beat the snott of the crisis. Camped swam, boom. Round-blood of big guns. In this case, a camp running married Francis Leopold, teenager who, in the creek he vocabulary in the 70s, described his feisty, spirited, strident, that is, comfort, capable smart. First assignment? Ralph had decided it. nothing galvanized to get a good role. If you remember the way the technique were, we put a name tag on it. We said, how do I know what we call something ? Laura Smith. He concepting something other than her name. And he would introduce her beginning to that. Correct. And we would create a story about this girl. And tell us something about tell people about, , she's 16 years old, she comes Charleston. She goes to MCD Portag difícil集tofag. school, , we would create this story and they could reveal first and then she would sit there and then she would be that first. Ord quickly spread breakfast that no one had seen. All noticed the clergy came here. They've been working over since dawn. It's going to be big. After breakfast, we all congregate. We all can't help but notice. Let's... That is so stupid. Is it a news? It's a mission. Graph got up on stages. It's a fine, very princess. It's character. Laura Smith. It was a girl who had really opened up her small group. Little character. She's a big character. That's why she's a huge, interesting person. It's character Laura. It's an impotted. She hadn't played with her. And then two other people on her small group, it broke in. It broke in. It broke in. It's a gossip. Okay, couple of people know this one. Here's how to go. Each of the real small groups were to send up two cameras, played the blabber whose job you talked about, she said she didn't want to be. So he knows me and she decided. She had a gorgeous head at sign right. In voice of the stage, throughout so much of the world sits in the chair. We're all looking for her. She's not. Right? And now everybody is experiencing her. And do you remember, my group is first here to send them to me. And I am  two folks and I think the girl, the first is all of them. really ideal. Her answers read, exercises for her. Just... F*** you! You got them bastards! And then just the... The... The... The... ... You never said this kind of thing to me too To anybody I mean in front of the bishop and front of all the sunday and in front of everybody who is unbelievable I mean, I think those people actually back up On the I do know that in the On the audience the room went the lecture Yes, and everyone really loves going up on the stage was  marching It was breathtaking, nerve-wracking, stunning. Mary Francis kept switching her tactics, slaughtering every person who was well. 10-1-up and 10-game meal, better with shake. One time she just stared at the company and said, nothing. The next pair she argued with, but the next she collapsed and inconged, called and she was in a speech variation. Whatever route was trying to do with this game, we used to gather, make a sense of the truth, teach Christian and the thing. The role-playing means succeeded in their work. I track down their brains, which is now a chemistry certificate about 25 years later, but she remembers it the afternoon of the criminal. None of us had quite come back to seeing her just mere friends. So we all stayed away. I think most of the people at camp were that colder. And the people who normally would have smiled and then pleasant quite as smile and pleasant. And the people who were my friends, , talked a little bit about it that it had been really bright. As we talked about it, she corrected me one key aspect that I could want to ask the way she found herself so much of a singer, a Ralph scenario. She straighted me out. It wasn't Ralph scenario at all. She made it up. I checked it from me. other people's experience at K&M. And it turned out that someone else there had experienced that. Had had an abortion? In abortion, this part of abortion said that the Edof 86. Well, this particular person had an abortion. And had talked about that key of the Nithed bin Galsk's about. And that session? Yes, that particular session. Can you hear my surprise? I do press doors. Try. of the power of easy to meet this quote, great performance. But of course what made it so powerful is a contrary to what Ralph Warner, nice and exercise to get an installation we can experience synthetically in the first save way. It becomes something far more devastating once given over experiences genius. The guilt she coached from us was real because we all had guns about that girl. We all really were those two people in the whole play. It was the most transcendent of all room plays. because there was almost no more playing at all. That kid is contributing at a different spot. Let's arrive on the lunch and get back to you. To... To... To... Coming up, white suburbanites taught that barge, lift that bail, sing some old Negro spirituals, and otherwise pretend to be slaves in the old South. Why they do it what they get out of it and what this aim of pretend is all about. It's a myth, some public radio international, way not spoken continues. This is American Life America's E2G, and of course we choose Dean, bring a variety of our strength. cautionary tales that games pretend backfire. We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, Act 3, what's the funny about peace love and understanding? The idea is simple. We made western suburbanites from that simple learning history. We will live history. We will become 19th century runaway slaves and for cost two hours we will face the enemies, we will hear your thoughts and we drive back to us with rooms to carry a small part of them back with us. and maybe this would teach us to take more time to get better neighbors. One more carefully about ourselves, about this is the idea. It says in the promotional material. This is the program that Ron Copeland got back in the first act, works for. Scott followed the North Star, the Connor Prairie Living History Museum outside of Indianapolis, 1400 acres, small towns, farest, farest, farest, farest, and narrowest buildings. And dozens of performers in-post will call historical interpreters, for them to take place. night, simulation of the underground railroad. This American life producer at least legal when it's found out what it is the people actually get out of this game. We are here to be abused, humiliated, degraded, verbally-indiscounted punishment. But before we get down to the business of being brutalized and reduced to nothing, we're briefed by a small woman in colonial dress who wants very much to repress upon us the serious nature of this program. She tells us it will be difficult, there will be language, it will be... physically demanding, we will be pushed and shoved and made to kneel down our lion our stomachs. Then she asks if there are any questions. Yes, I will be. Do you suggest that we just get our dance room? Yes, yes, we're on the dance room. For group of people facing 90 continuous heads of abuse, we are in our remarkably upbeat mood. On the guided walk out to the first step, program that we wanted to chattering, laughing, I will be going. I think you're going to be scared. I think you're going to be scared. I think you're going to be scared. I mean, they can yell at us. I don't care about that. I want to be scared. So we know what we're going to do. Although I've been told by the people running Oliver in my star that in equal number of black and white patrons the people in my group are mostly white and mostly women. The tone of the group is dominated by five 13 year old girls, Sadie, Amanda, Rachel, Trish, and Brittany, all friends from the same junior high school who read about the program in the paper and came because it sounded mean. Then there's Linda, a blonde-haired mother, too, who has brought her husband in two teenage children to put around because she feels it's important for them to have a learning experience. And Henry, who is a long-french code in a dental-ficed social-fistly, has a lover of history. There is Louise, a 34-year-old Baker woman who's ancestors were probably the endership. 3. 16 year old who are studying this for war, a handful of other adults, and finally, there's Pete and Alexander. The only African Americans in the group, both in baseball caps and white glare jeans, were here, they said, to observe that. I'm the only way I can see the size of the house. I'm the only way I can see the size of the house. Our guide needs us to the top of the hill, a small hunk of land over with the dark bell. At the base of the hill we can see the cliff. a girl with bomb fire, but beyond that nothing, just the random black rodents. We stand in pondered for a minute while our god gives us parting instructions. Please refrain from attacking the interpreters. Then it's time to meet our master. Well, that's all for here on the right side. I want the raiders over on the left side. Help me! At the bottom of the hill, four men and costumes around us and start screaming. Everything is chaos. Before I know what's happening, the lover of him. this real long based down in the grass. This arms spread wide  Jesus. And the mother of two who felt her children who didn't in educational experiences on her knees had down, waging out of the ground. While her son stands temporary with the rest of her feet, , educated. Don't let her meet! You don't even look at me! What's your train, boy? You think that's your train? What's your train, hands with me? What's your train, dude? Get on your knee! Go Yo how are you all? to see what's the card or what? Oh! their heads are down, their eyes are lowered, staring at it, some of his book points just beyond the lower nerves. One of the master's snakes is waiting to go to girl working the motor. He leans in close with his lander so they can feel the heat of the blow him on that face. Then starts to breathe. Two of the girls get to shave their lips from the boat. Another girl ties on her white headband, a signal to the slave master and step up. How do you be? 13. 13, where are you being good? greater than we probably get nine canaps. that? Sell them all there we can make this a lot of are you looking up? Are you looking up? They're rot! You say? Then you say, sir. Every time a white man talks to you, you answer them, sir. You understand me? It's surprising the effective, a kind of collectible new nation, so brutal and bizarre it needs to be. every detail kind here. You notice the blatant risk let's press the bluish tint rubber on your shoe. The shadows of life. The acid smell of lantern food. The bullet and texture of the scarf took into the hood. Finally the masters get tired of yelling and paralysis and to single-fire line. One of the masters leaves the other behind the archipelago. These waving is done with black and barking had orders. Stay in line, keep your eyes down. March fast, march slower. And pass, lift, right in the ball. Sing. Say it! I want all you fun! Come on! Say it! I'll get you up there, you moron! Quite as fast! You even love him! Singin' shit! And then he's in the air. Yeah. Damn it! In this context, the absurdity of white-spirited mission teachers in the nightly senior school is sexually touch. They march up the hill, singing shyening, and at the top of the hill there's a waist-pound pile of work, and then 20 feet away, there's a trick, and our master instructs the women to carry the wood from the pile to create one piece of chalk, and then instructs the men to move to a bathroom tree to pile, two pieces at a time. Let's get started! Come on, quick, quick! One of the 16-year-olds stumbled in the master's course at App Group and tells it to come here. I know you can come here. Let me hear you. Let me hear you. What do you want me to yell? Sister. Yeah. Tell me the rules. No, no way! Now move the wood! Keep the element. Move the wood! Now move the box back to the shoe. So keep the element. Keep moving. Move the wood! Move the wood! Move the wood! Move the wood! I don't know what! I don't know what! I don't know what! I don't know what! Now I've been in Fire Slade Master's alone on the top of the hill. I know it's been night with a tenth meter at... We continue to move the wood in the pile to the tree back again. No one makes brick for it. No revolve. Not even the hint of the assistance. We're broke. It's taking 15 minutes. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Finally our work is interrupted by a white woman in a full life Finally our work is interrupted by a white woman in a full life Prairies. her to her parents and her parents. She leads us into her barn and burrates us at one of the main thrust of her thyroid being that you are stupid and flottingly and should probably be set back to Africa. But in between in-celled she manages to drop a series of useful survival tips for the one-way slate. Seek out pickers, they will help look for handkerchiefs tied to door knobs for burning canvas windows. Those are signs that a quicker thing. Always send one person head to ask their friend, friend. That's the password, friend of friend. Then she leads us through a small wood to a dirt road which winds its way along the corner. Point down the road and tells us to look for a small cat with a rope. We tell her thank you. She tells us get off the land and group with down the land. How are you going to do it? Is she going to do it? I mean, it's  natural scary. I mean, it's not , you don't want some of us to do it. I don't know. It's , you don't look at me. I mean, this is how it went. and see real light. This is how it was in the act of social service. People, I'm a tad bit scared of people. I actually helped them all. I know. Then I catch up to Pete Nell and say, I'm gonna be a black guy somewhere. How are you guys doing? I just can't say that. Really? Do you want to be white and tense? Yeah. We jogged on the road. In the distance to the left, or maybe 500 feet ahead is campfire. We can see the outline of the small girl. shadow of the fire. She's calling out to emotionally my arms for us to come to the room. But the group hangs back that she had in the song. Then out of the bushes, and then we've begun to trap. Oh, that's it! We, but 19 new western suburbanites come normally set loose in the Uvena world in this Nill a print chap run and run their lives as if. Well, is it... something actually depended on it. In the night era with my tip, put a bounce and bruising to my hips, trying  that. Probably her team knows. And when on my microphone screen, you have all of the pieces of action values, I feel excited firstly, more free than I have. It's not clear what we should do or where we should go, who we should trust, and this perhaps the best part. I find myself do think and control it and realize that the idea of the simulation that we would improve but it has put it out of my mask. and into a more authentic experience of slavery has completely evaporated. Now it is not about understanding the slavery. It is about survival and then unsurped moral to people who bathe in the old and taller and easier. It is a more fashion-free country that was waiting for my children. If you have children or children鬆, let's get them back out of my market. You must symposium on later that there are no slaves that failed to find or don't need Sarah. I ran them breakfast, blight, the processing succeeded. I'm just a mystery map on it. 50 feet we've gathered with the candle. We've got a wrecked image. The cabin is up to the seat belt, so we can't get a plot. Then send it to the represent, break, just the wuddles. One first shot. Let's pass board. Free the frame of a friend. Ready, free the free. Free the frame of a friend. You're not great. Thank you. You're all the coffee beans. Inside the cabin, a talk and he looks  a slim down version of that guy on the figure of its box. Of course, that's cold water. The picture passes out flat surface point where it's small, low hot pots. And gives us short history of the figure's playlists element, school playlists. We all sit. cross-light the dirt court with great folks who are really fond of it. Then is what is it? And this is the their senders who's been wanted to subbed by us, who will screw this these taxes. Here's another family in these parts. Their name is War. They are from North Carolina, and they are colored folks  the. I would suggest that these seek out folks such as them should slave hunters come through these parts. They will not know these in the locals. God be with you, Seetra. Travel with Moses for the town. They together as proof, or I will sign. You've got to be with me forever. I'll be with you forever. Describe what's going on now. Describe what this looks . There's really big white house with a white line. And Kevin, he's brown, there's no black. I'm walking through  this, we've got the trees running us. And there's... Hold on out! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! My... my... my... Look at what we got here. The laughing man needs his... And now we're... the top of its house, and he said a big leather ride. He walks over one of the girls and starts to slow himself away from the top of her head, down the other head, and then under her head. He's got a big lot of back of his stuff, which he and keeps steady in the middle. He's got a big leather ride, and he's got a big leather ride, and he's got a big leather ride. the man with the sense of the things that he has done so us. Then Moses, Quaker Boyz was the helping us. He said that he's going to get the authority and sick of him with. Then the man with the way to the sense of the peace and his best rose to space. This seems to impress me. Any office to give them the number of the whip ten dollars in the gold coin, let us go free. The men with a whip decide to do  this. I'm a big one. He pulls that one if he goes for the draws. She's not more this is to hit the next chin. Do you want one to do? You find me hit this thing a little bit. my myself. She's just, please grab this. Say what I mean. Take your $10. You get this whole bunch out of here and I keep this in here. Come on, this is all. No, that's where it's gonna be. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. You don't want to stay. It's $20,000. It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... Get him out of here right now. Get him! You're right now. The girl stands for the rest of the group's first act or... At first the group takes off her and... ... but we come up short of that two hundred-to-beaters. I... He's supposed to be a... Thank you. I think that's going to be a good one. I'm going to say that. Come on. We're going back to get the girl is not supposed to be part of this simulation. We're supposed to debate whether or not that way the moral choices and realize that our survival means a big sub-ahom. There's a museum plan. A man posing as a member of the painting public whose job is to keep us on track. He keeps telling good to go to forget about her. He gets... We're going to have to hear some song. Let's go. Happy assault back as you're rushing ahead of everyone all the time. We have to get out of here together. We have to get out of here together. This is the closest any bus get to a real test of what's supposed to be. And peed and Alexander decided to hear us. They head back into the woods to save the girl, even the rest of the group behind the car by the station. But about 50 feet in for the interaction, a man in costume with the large gun appears at the court. Here's that court. a new scene worker invisibly tracking the food's progress, in tone unsquash from the baby with blue she needs to breathe. I can't do that, sure! I can't do that, sure! Less than five minutes later the girl would join us. She's looked quiet and with that staff smile, she officially said she escaped. In another ten minutes we'll blast up for an in front of an old man in a long glass or flat up . Blackwoods, who stands up wouldn't have above us for a shoo. He looks down on us, right there. Then picks up his keen and walks forward. He's catching a soft shoo. He's a fox. You? You? And you back there. You listen to that. You blend in. Folks there, listen to that. And live a long and successful walk. You? You can talk about the slaves. Just take it down the jarge and sold and work in the rice fields. You can't pass me that. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. and taking a Georgia and working in the right fields for their specials. We walk out onto a broader path into the better, actually, , we're directed into a debris from where there are two long papers of ginger cookies and juice in large dicks and crops, food with several layers. They're about 20 other people, other layers from other groups, who feel they need to sit and talk about their experience. I circulate asking everyone I see, do they think they would have been? They had actually been born during this period. And the answer, maybe not surprised me, is always the same. Whether the person I'm talking to is black or white. I would be of Europe. This means different things, different reasons. The African Americans would admit that they would plot things. I definitely find I probably end up getting killed. I would be free to be about this. I'll be the man. Try it on the way. There's no waste of equipment or metal theory. I got Keats. I'd be the first to teach you. Here, tell me, I'd be chased out. I would be with you. You would be  really rebellious. What I'd be? I just know that I wouldn't last very long. I'd probably be shot or hot. Because I would try to save my family. This much is good. I'd be  really rebellious. It's hard for any of us to imagine ourselves in the wrong set of history. In the past, or in all the way to the program except one, so that they would have fought slavery if they had lived during this time. I'm definitely helpful in the black scheme. I mean, I just can't stand to see people mistreated. God stood upon the search for a reek. He was no question in your own head. You guys would be on the right side. Oh man. God would be here. We're a conductor. I'm around here. We're actually helping go out here. I can see how some people would be a little bit more timid and just  the family was just in their house. People keep to them and they held them in their house well and then let them go. And I'll go with people. We hold firm preferences better cells even when they are contacted by actual experience. Ricky Murphy is an African American man who went out with one of the early criss. And  the 16-year-old in my group was made to act over seer. In the debriefing room I catch him laughing about how hard he was on his far slings. That's me. Who asked me why was I as a chosen one to give on the orange? It's a play I got pretty pissed off. I was , come on, what a lovely thing! And I went, look, shut up, I was just , shoot it off! Those rules...Son of a bitch!!! later I sit on a bench and talk to her to his wife, share. And when I ask him who he thinks he would have been in here lived during his period, his answer is the same as the other actor. I would have been with Alex, I would live there. So I remind him of his behavior this very night. But after 20 minutes of abuse, he could hardly bring him sit with up, turned on his own people, and turned himself on their pleasing his master. And this surprises me. I didn't even realize it had happened in two hours. I'm looking back. But what I think about it is that I'm looking at the things. Okay, I came to them all over it. And it was me. We are careless in who we pretend to be. We are unmarried. We're dreamers. We pretend things about ourselves in the mean of state and for reality. And this is their... more and more simulated experiences. We can pretend that we are a frontier mountain and 1740s or a world where one doble fighters or someone from the middle ages. White's attack can seem even go to a simulated zoo village to make their travel. So we'll dress in the court that was a piece of art. We'll lie down in civil war trenches with a tendency valley to town. We'll fast and slave chains to art risk and run screen for the woods. Maybe one death that we might have in public. We will play it live. with B-know, non-a-tip or level with it, but will never be or even resemble it, and then never do it. To be speak. You wired me a week and hit me with the hands of broken life. You tied my leading pull my chain to watch my blood begin more. But I'm going to break. I'm going to break my... You're going to break my rusty page and run. I'm going to break. I'm going to break my... Don't break my rusty. Well, the program was produced today by the Whisky Boom myself and the Updack in G.E.
