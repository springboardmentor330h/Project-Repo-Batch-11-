Well, back in 1945, what Stromer was wounded in battle with Barch, there's permanently blinded, sent home. The next year or so when I was back home, going to college, I was dreamed that I was driving car and then in the dream I would think, you shouldn't be doing this here, you're blind. The fact he realized in his dream, who's always in this. Little... to the day, at 50 years later. Still has these beautiful times. Sometimes I will dream of myself as I was a teenager and those dreams are almost completely as I would have been here. See, or occasionally I will still in dreams see a page of hope and read it. And absolutely I may even remember a sense of what I was up to. This just trauma says to 10 or 15 years of blindness for you showed up in his own dreams, it's a blind person. And at some point, he started to wonder, why did he let it go? He wrote a letter to a publication called, Harrap Beach News asking anybody else had this experience. He got a handful of letters. People who lost. Some of them started seeing themselves as your chairs, their bodies, whatever. And then if you mind Once others, it was years before it was incorporated and I think almost all of them say it's just sometimes they will see themselves as in a wheelchair. We have to stop now. I think what we want to do is create a set of things. We go along in this wheelchair and it gets to curb the chair. We'll get out of it. We get out of the chair. We'll just lift it up on curtain and it gets back in. What? Ha ha ha. For one woman wrote about she will dream that she's walking with her husband and he's pushing her wheelchair and then he sees somebody come. It's quick to get back in the wheelchair, people come. mood Cheers let's go. in order to manage. I've been in the wheelchair since I've been in the 1966 during the dream state. I've never visualized myself in the wheelchair. I've been in Patents in 1962. But in dreams, I see myself as a stud in glad with any of the cute things. Yes. That comes through in the couple of the letters. And it's not always called one of the people wrote, I guess I had raised question, what doesn't it be dream? brain cat shop and show you the reality and she said, well, I should be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life. , maybe part of the function of dreams is to give us a few minutes of respite and happiness so we come out of it and say hey, that's all pretty good. One man, we'll show you stress. This is better than just a harmless means I can re-experience walking running. temporarily, a wake up mentally refreshed at ease. Mr. Stramo was a college professor and he spent some time researching why our subconscious mind takes so long to absorb the new facts that are vised, why his brain took a decade to admit himself in dreams that he was blind. He says nobody really knows why. It might be chemical. It might simply be that it's common for us all to see ourselves one way. When we're out of reality, we're not that way at all. Welcome to the Beesie Chicago and Public Radio International. It is this American life for my request. Today on our program, Defying Sickness, Act 1, Road Trip, Father & Son, Go on a long car ride.

Before he retired, high was a salesman for four years, did a few years of comic in a bottle of a hat. Who is a boxer? One is white class in the very first Golden Gloves competition. Another day at Alzheimer's, Dr. said that he should stay inside or without a stimulation. The central vibe. What if we try? Just for a brief time. Something to be great. I was visiting the farm. We were driving something and saying, he was babbling on and saying, does he? These greats mention, these are three major movies. I feel is that he can talk. And in the middle of one of these riffs he turned to me, a book of panic, and he said, the trouble with me is I never get to the point where I get to the point. And that was so urgent and observation about his predicament that it entered my consciousness in way that we need to say. Now that's it, I'm gonna make a film about it and he's at a place in this. disease where before he's completely gone, while he has some consciousness and not his situation, I'm going to take him out into the world again and see what happens to him and how he handles him. He's at a camera and went on a three-week trip, driving full-bodied out back to New York City. Joe Mayawitz's son Sasha did most of the filming. He hears voice only a few times for the documentary.

He had me work out on a light bag  this. He always felt that if he got into a scrape, maybe that you shouldn't run away. His motto was, step in the little bit of the first blow. He said, take the biggest guy down. And that was his act. He wouldn't stop on runaway for many. On Mars and having blocking you, he was considered the mayor of block.

You have known as the largest serious artists in the art field. Okay, what about Stevie? What Stevie's business. Stevie. Stevie. Does it bother you that you can't remember your kid's name? sometimes they can't remember what they do well. Yeah, yeah, I see them. Hello. Goodbye. That's it. Not complaining. Is it hard to see you? Sorry. Hello. It's sad. I have a feeling of sadness. I also have feeling of acceptance. We've been apart for 20 years. In the mutual prime of our lives, I was raised in my children. He was a great group of work together. It's so unfunz. I guess I'm just accepting of where he is. If we had been together for 20 years and had seen the decline that I had been relating to him, emotionally, lovingly all that time, I might be the deeper sadness. But even though he's my father, the distance that we've been apart all these years has for some kind of a buffer in here. So this is the guy I know now. We have... much closer, much easier when we see each other. Talk to each other. And have a good day, Newy. So I want my year to sit up. You're sure you're here, though. I'm just a sweet person. I'm just being hearty. You're here for me. What do you want me to do? You're here. My child, I don't know you. But that's so far away. I can't relate sets of that. I mean, I love even that unequivocal way. Child loves a parent. And I feel a lot of care for you, a kind of reaper. I guess I'm renal or rebirth of sheave in this period. Take a master shower and I grow up in town. Actually, see. He always had in my hands, my field of suppression, my hands. It's been many years since I had that kind of contact with my father. And it was a little strange, he first, I thought. It's  to rub this other person's body, touch this other person's body. It's  death threats. And then it releases my father. He's in need. He can't take care of himself all the time. Okay, here's the problem. Hold on. Okay, here comes that. Joe, my Joe, do  who I am? Who? Let me know how come my mom's son. Don't let me get married with me. Very nice. important because I didn't travel. But it my father had a classic marriage with his generation. He loved my mother, she was beautiful and hot tempered and exciting person to be with. But he wanted something so hard that he didn't know how to get her. She couldn't get and that was a kind mother love. A hee. himself hadn't experienced. No? Yes, I'm okay. No, not having a good time. Are you having a good time? Why, really? Okay, why should be healthy? And sure. And smile, sorry. His mother had been bed with him after his birth, and then she died soon after. So he never really knew. That's the deepest rule in his memory, which is. I think I'm required as long. Okay, down the judges, because right now I'm getting the first one of your assists. And I will give back maybe to come across here now. Oh, sound. Would you go with me to the next ship? Would you go with me to the next ship? Okay. All right, mate, take care of yourself. Be careful with her. Be careful. Boop it out. And I think that from my point of view now that if he had really just loved my mother without demanding something from her or needing something from her which was their child in the evening, that she probably wouldn't have just loved him back for crying, warm, funny man that he was. But because there was something that he was demanding, she couldn't even do. kind of prefers logic of leadership. She made about something  that, but maybe I didn't do nothing. Why she made it? She made it. She sounds very, very bad. She sounds  she didn't care. She probably was caring a lot. She was just why she didn't want me to be called. I'm waving also when I think of her being by herself. That's a B-d-d-d-d. That'd be you. Which has to come. Yeah, I'm... It's my love that I'm having when I . I'd love to do love to be involved with. The idea is that I always have to include. Mother. Throughout the trip, he asked for sound. Everything. Where's the music? thinking that she should have built in the car next day. Sorry! You need your salary upshave there? Yeah, 5, 2, 3, 4. Look here, my sister, I know this right here, that's nothing no salary. I do it as your salary won't do up my seats, that's perfect. It's still up. That was happy to sell it here. Yeah, yeah, it's still up. Uhh... You guys are not the poem, she's not me now. I know, I know. She may she here. She's nice. Although she's not in a trance, you wouldn't do that to her. I'm not even a term to this job, , I'm at the smartest, the cutest in this world. I even, if my mommy, if my mommy don't shut up and then don't come down to five minutes, I want no way she is. This is my wife. That's right. Get all the better's in the trunk. How do we start? Is this his wife? It was a time we were driving with her and sliding in the forward made film. And she was sitting right next to me and he leaned over to me and he said, where's mom? And I said, mom, who's sitting next to you? He looked over his presidency next to me and said, well, that's not sound. He's been... Good morning. Good morning to you. Good morning, bro. Yes. I hit, that he's not hearing. I don't really know. His real intelligence is to live his moment. He knew where he was and he was just enjoying his experience. But he couldn't really look back and watch me enjoy. even now before I've never been able to. And I tested him in time because I wanted to see his stimulation connection and live in the instrument to help him and bring him back. So that was his hope and hope that it didn't stop him having anything. This is why I reviewed his questions. But I'm not going to my training. So, I'm not going to. Remember? And you have the things on the trips. We do, but you have just going to say, don't ask me about anything I did. Why? Why? Because that's a go home man. It's gone. That's not that business. It wasn't so many things going on, but I just don't remember the jumbled. But it's a car I went to the old building, train. I was going in the middle of the direction. And I was losing sight. I was always in sight for no reason whatsoever. Everybody was going around. Tamar. Tamar. Tamar. Tamar? Tamar? Tamar? Tamar is not tamar, but Tamar is to have, to kiss and to love.

And it's amazing though. with merciless of all samus, clodding everything that something is implying. This thing needs to grow up in charge. Stayed with him.

So he's trying to do exactly what doctors say they cannot. We've arrived at Act 2 of our show. My world record. This is from a book by Tom Andrews, but he gets most. On November 15th, 1972, one week after Nick's free elected, I clap my heads for 14 hours, 31 minutes. I was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. Up. was 11 years old. My record was published on paid 449 of the 1974 edition of the Guinness Book, landlocked between the listings for large circus and club swing. In the chapter entitled Human Achievements, the listing read, the duration record for continuous clapping is 14 hours, 31 minutes. by Thomas C. and Charleston West Virginia, or November 15, 1972. He sustained an average of 120 flaps per minute at an all-ability range but at least 100 yards. I'm writing this for my bed at University of Michigan Hospital. It is 3 a.m. is the half-dark hospital set 9. I've had an accident. I have been in an accident. That is grapple. That was the nightmare's past. When I muttered that technically, it's my mother's brother to the hospital, she revealed, Ellen Blanc said the employer headline says, you did that. Clap your hands. or did you have a major lead or what? Here time, it was certainly nice to read that you had broken the world record clapping.

Good luck. Wait, you said, I said, you have root here. Yeah, they have root here. John said, I said, I was asking her a thing very much. I don't think I could go the whole day.

My argument was that just being there in teach the hunt while I was crucial early hours, great rural record was fishing participation. And that's the end. a little root beer under the circumstances, put me silently in the off day spirit of things. She didn't see that way. What surprised me was how easy it was to be precise and system. Two hours into the record I felt as if my hands,  the legs of runners who had broke the wall with hammer and leg- at themselves effortlessly at that point I knew I would not start. I had no doubt. Yet my hands kept hammering. Next is problem. He's not eating right my mother said. It's playing his day. Anywhat you can see it just look . It was 5-30.

Meanwhile I start a lead and with deep prior to September 8 to get my blood to clot. More experts, I stopped leading into the spinal muscles. Soon enough my humanity said my body will loosen and break down and absorb the hardened blood surrounding the spine as it happens to my neck.
