And to start today's program, just act for you, according to the installation and it's a front camera. And that's so popular in Canada that people chant this ad in bars. It's made the front page of every major people in Canada, all the nightly newscasts, the Canadian Heritage Minister that broke the book of Americans in Boston this week, to explain Canadian cultural identity. Niyad, a young man walks on to a stage for a huge... each maple leaf flag goes to a microphone, pass it neatly to begins. Hey, I'm not a lumberjack, sir, trainer. I don't live in an igloo or even a lover or own a dog sled, and I don't know Jimmy Sally or Susie from Canada, although I'm certain her, really, really nice. I have a prime minister, not a president. I speak English and French, not American, and I pronounce it about not a book. I come Biologyändice- My country's flag and my backpack. I believe in peacekeeping, not police. Diversity, not simulation. And at the Beaver is a truly proud and no one in. A poop is a hat. It's just a field in the home. And it needs more now to send. Not sending. Set. He's the second one. His land has a diverse picture. He's a superhero. A superhero. A superhero. My name is Joe. My name is Joe. My name is Joe. Here they end with the ad, the product brush on stain, Molesan's beer, which in Canada is not called Molesans. It's called Canadian. But my shand is Vice President for Marketing for Molesan's media and even Geese surprised at the reaction to the ad. People are doing things  studying, sharing in theaters when it's been shown, , we played it. Rocky, it has in 2020, thousands of people have shared  they just want to stay at cop. And you just can't help it, , few. been in one of those arenas or you've been in a theater and seen how people generally reacted. You can't help but think and see something's going on. And there is now Spoof all over the place. In fact there was a double-page Brent and one of the National newspaper yesterday that had a picture of a rack or a middle of it and there's no Spoof all around. I think I think somebody who wanted to be, it's I am Pakistani. Oh I'm in front of that one. Hello my mom doesn't have a dot on her forehead and my dad doesn't wear a turban. I don't live in a grass-harder eat curry every day or owner-fine carpet and I don't know Robin D'Arpree are actually, they're all sure they're very, very nice. I have a military dictator and I have a primary and square on and on and on down to Pakistan's the second largest seapay for the politically displaced, the first nation of cricket and the most corrupt part of South Asia. My name is Khan and I am Pakistani. What of course, every ethnic group in Canada is weighing in with its own version of the ad. People come to understand it. People fill over up. And to have a card of arms that, on the one hand, gives you the thrill of being in a cheering mob, yet when we are number one. While on the other hand, it simply, just kind of a joke. That is a very appealing package. You get the pleasure of being a mob without the threat of mob violence. Lysings territory inism. rampaging and rioting. There is a deep part of most of us. It takes pleasure in being in a crowd. A real crowd. A massive people that is thinking and doing the same thing at the same time, jumping to its feet as one unit yelling from the cause or team or band or whatever. Stay in our program. The pleasure of being in a mob, the terror of being a mob, all together. The program today in three acts at one among the thugs. They'll be up for a joint mob as it riot. and he writes, I thought, wait this, but nothing would happen to me. I've got anything to happen to me. Two, one-toned soldier writes away. What happens when a teacher in a small town in Connecticut turns a class of seven graders into an angry mob on the rampage. That's three, the hissing of winter bonds, which at least legal explains how a 21st century mob may be different than its predecessors, stay with us. At one, in 1984, Bill Beeperard said that to try to understand the soccer organs who were rioting in ways large and small, and the regular basis after soccer matters in England. He drank with them, went to matches with them, got to know them, and as a count of his time with him, caught among the thugs, is this remarkable doctor. As Beeperard points out, to change your time, many people have written that they hate that they were almost always outside. fighting the observers standing outside the action. Few people have written from the perspective of someone caught up in violence. And by the time he is done, you understand that the thrill of being in a rampaging mob is as hard-wired into this, as basic to as as a species, as he built it around. Though we have been agreed to come on to our program and read an excerpt from this book, a scene in which he goes with 257 fans, soccer team, manchester united, and set to Edward to see their team fight. Very. is a phenomenal amount of drinking. Some supporters are arrested. On the buses to the stadium, they urinate up windows, they moon the Italians, they scream of Senators at the Italians. They throw bottles at the Italian. Finally, they're Italian boys. This one's the way they think many people after this kind of song. The answers in the comment. Rose, the stone back. One stone. The effect of those times of class was me. To be Submine, the target. Team's trap shot. The ink could do it was a move. Thone. Pastors were as far as the story. After all, in stones at the windows. And the look on his face conveyed such urgent dismay that you could only agree that a stone throwing a time was a very bad person indeed. The presumption. After all, a window could get broken and someone might get hurt. It was deep on the answer. Never when we came, very bad. angry. Looking around me, I realized that I was no longer surrounded by raiding, and starkly nationalistic, social-beadness. I was surrounded by raiding, and starkly nationalistic, social beadions, in a frenzy. And anything that came to hand, all, Charles de Names, fruit, art and juice, anything was summarily hold through the window. Master, sometimes attention. Lobbing an open beer can at a cluster of elderly men and dark jackets. The Bastions. When the buses the United Supporters pulled into the crew, the beachado cast spent studio, Kumunami. A large crowd was already there, waiting for English. Some of the match started, was fine. And while it could be said that there was no singles. series. It could also be said that there was no moment for the power of the world. The things were coming out of the media, which spirals and the security, but also long sticks to the staff that just flags, firecrackers and smoke bombs. Several people were hurt, and once the border was taken away at the hospital. And then when the match ended, everything started moving, it graced speed. Everything were continued to move, it graced speed from many hours. I remember that riot police started kicking on its borders with fallen down. Hungry? Remember hearing that Sammy had arrived and then coming up on. Sweet. Well, grassman had the hornmen glasses that made him look  a physics student standing underneath bleachers, attached and mashed, expensive leather bag and a camera hanging over shoulder. Having just come from France, I guess. I remember screaming that had been in stabbing, right? And with the screaming, everyone, both animals in the state-speed, push past the police and rush the egg. The game that the town was on and that's what... It's not a lot of sand. It was impossible to out. Throughout this last period of the month, I have been hearing a new phrase. It's going to go off. It's going to go off. As I said, we're glad to see you, so we've brought it. If this keeps up, then it's going to go off. And the phrase we're correct. It's going to go off. It's going to go off. It's on the stop. I'm going to repeat it. Everyone is pressed against the lock gate and the police arrived from Momentslater. Police pulled and pushed in one direction and the order is pushed in another one. It was shot on the half-shoe. It was crashing. The control. The order was removed. It's going to be gone. It was being heard. Watch out for the noise. I heard. I heard. It's gone. Go on. I was going nervous that my notebook into my shirt up against my chest, but in my jacket, the chance started. I did not do it. I did not do it. The chat was clicked, sure. I did not do it. The word was repeated in I did. Through the repetition, it is meaning started to change. We're hitting master sporting a better of football club. I am standing in stead  a champ, you. something lit, it become a chant for law. The night did, the night did, night did, night did. That's not the gate had been open and the English order of the search, but we were. And when they emerged, they came out very fast when they were in the high, , they came and came along with everyone, pressed together, hands and shoulders and the person in front. moving quickly, moved to the spread, racing down the line of movies, how much shield, and cunningly, and original who are. The line of police led to the buses, but just before the bus door, someone brought ear sharply in the long on. The police said I've disputed this and we're waiting. The group turned again, varying in another direction, rushed out of the space between the two buses. It came to the set of the stop, and I slammed into the person in front of me, the people slammed it to me from behind. There are about 200 people crushed together but they seem able to move in unison some giant strangely coordinated in search. The third direction was common. Police were not there. They were no police. What was the duration of our life? About 20 minutes. It was windy and dark. I'm a tree. Blowing back and forth in front of the street. three times. As long moving, shabby. I was never able to sit in it. The new problem is having the room at the group broke three. It ended as back in every single one. It's only a different back later. It broke down. It's having the shabby time and time and time and time and time . That works. It's here to be measuring the group. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. The energy is found. It's the birth. Luke Constantine looking how old were actions. He was holding up some animals in the house. And there were six or seven young supporters dropping beside him. And it would be some kind of boy who realized that there were always six or seven young supporters dropping. What he turned in one direction, they turned with him. What he went backwards, they had an accident. No doubt of Sammy had suddenly become airborne. There would have been six or seven younger supporters desperately piping their arms trying to do the same. Yeah. The Henry supported room pack, very first after 8, around 16, but they might have been 4. They might have been 9. I take pleasure even now, then there's nothing more to overgrow on your rooms. They were nested with a little 9-year-old. But in some kind of pre-pubescent confusion, regardless of Sam. At one moment, a cluster of police came rushing towards us and Sammy, having spotted him, whispered a new command, seeing how we... We work spurs. Members of the groups stood out. Some are lost in this room. Some cheering on down the set of it. Some falling behind and they got past the prison. We're at on Sammy turned round. And back to the room. We group. And the little ones were entering dogs. Where did the members of the group? I climbed along. Everyone was moving at such speed that They'd sure I didn't miss anything. I concentrated on Sam. I'd see that this is a certain period. What are you doing? That's it. After you turn around, running backwards, you're in quick hit sound. It's nicely messed up. You had made a point of asking this question loudly, and I hope that the others have been here as well. Just the thing that I'm on. Fuck! One is one of some. That's it. I've got back of it. Just outside of strike point. I looked about. I didn't recognize him. I was surrounded by him, but I had him. Where's I was surrounded by people? I hadn't met him, and I'm telling you, oh, nobody's saying, where? There's a mute, it's running. It's sound of their feet on the paper. And every now and then Sammy would whisper one of his friends. I remember thinking, there's also a girl. Don't want to know. And then Sam, that he dressed the moment to be right. Sam, stop. It's been a bit of an hour. because the visibility shouted stop. Everyone's on me. Turn. Who won? They knew it was true, Pat. I did. He was only then that I saw the Italians with the cannons. You had light, street light darkness. I couldn't tell how many they were, but there were nothing to realize. Shit. That I was now unexpectedly in the middle of a very big fight. Having dropped back and did I have a reason to stand in this darkness. I was in the rear with the groups turned. Suddenly, it becomes a trap. The adrenaline is one of the bodies more powerful. Seeing the English on one side of me, I remember seeing me quickly, I'm probably a small person, right in the circle of the evening here, and moving out of every bit of the body. There was a war. Everybody lying. And the English support is a char. In the next second I went down, the dark blur then smashed. I got to have said it in the bread there before. Going to the house when I found the open. Because I got up two places. Going to the house. And one of them clubbed me on the back of the head. Back there with me. Directly patting. So close. I'm going to reach out. Just stay. I'm going to hang. Toilew. I've been knocked down. As you. getting up and he was supported by the boy down. He had ramming his body and he had his horse face. He fell back and his head hit the pavement. Back and then fell in the sun. Two of the matches came out of his body. One, the boy in the ribs. It was a soft sound, surprising. You could do the impact of the shoe in the fabric of the boy's clothing. He was came again this time very hard and sound was still soft. He was a boy which gently connected and sound the guard's ability. ribs and the other English supporter that came in the face. This was a soft sound. Well, it was different. You can tell that it was this face that had been gained from our body and not something  that. It's not a good. Another medicine I was ordered here. Another, and then third, they were now six and they all started to keep in the morning, around the boy group in the face. I was transphate. It was a time. dramaticly slow down, each second had a state beginning and and my sequence of images on a roll of film. Two more maps you have to move. There's no speak. Only that soft beauty is out, although sometimes it was a grappling one. Flowed, what have we ever? Part of it. Eight, and eight in the bullet once. At what point is the job? I've been in the basement of here, I don't remember. I've been in the basement for too many before. The basement came running hard, knocked over to the supporters and the others fled and then time accelerated no longer slow motion time but time moving very fast. I mean what happened to the boy? I then noticed that all around me there were others  him, others who had been tripped up and had their faces kicked. I had the sides that got out of the ground, the boy running in the hallway. And if an accident of the supporters, it had now gone off. With that first violin exchange, some kind of threshold had been cross some no-sional boundary. On one side of that boundary, it had been a set of limits, an ordinary understanding the amount of this line, what you didn't do. We were now someplace where there would be few limits, where the sense that there were things you didn't do, and see what's there. It came very hard. I caught up with Sam. Sam he was. transport, snapping, finger, jockey in place, as legs pumping up and down, and he was repeating the phrase, it's gone wrong, it's gone wrong, it's gone wrong. It could be what I'm saying.

Somebody near me said that he was happy. He said that he was clear, very happy. could not remember ever. for a beast happy and I looked at my heart again wanting to memorize the space that I'm a 500-later at Ascam. What it was that day first happens. What it was . It was a strange thought. Here was someone who believed that this precise moment, following the streets come on. He had succeeded in capturing what it lies most delusive holidays. But then he, days, babbling away about his happiness, disappeared from the ground. A group across the street made her into such a pit of the traffic was a bus and what of support is step up to the front of it and from about 60 girls something with great force. It wasn't stone, it was big and made of metal  a manhole of a car and straight into the driver's windshield. Sound of that shadowing windshield I realized now was a powerful stimulant physical of the cars and trains. Sound crossing the intersection. Traffic coming from board directions. Supporters, trotting at top of cars. The sound of the sting going through the windshield. The crash following this impact At the effect, it's increasing the heat of feeling. I can't describe it any other way. It was almost literally a matter of tension. We moved on. The bin was thrown through a car show room window. There was another loud crash in sound. A shot. It's all was smashed. Close. in shock, it's Windows or Smash, and one or two English supporters language will live in the display. City is ours, and it repeated the possessive each time greater than this. What happens when a crowd goes over the edge, or the clip, the metaphors will have been a revealing. This is the way they talk about the fact that they talk about having to have, of being unable to forget it when they do, of not wanting to forget it.

They talk about it with the pride of the privilege those who have seen help, then through something that other people are not. I'm it's is one of the most intensely clear. experiences. And for those capable of giving themselves over to it, it's one of the most surprises. I found the group passed over its metaphorical clip that I literally become waiter. I had a fan there, grabbed, was waited. I felt myself to be hovering above myself, able for receiving everything in slow motion, and in overwhelming detail. And for the first time, I'm able to understand the words they used to speak. The Crown Finance was there, Drunk. It was  for me an experience of absolute peace.

You can see when people's eyes are, and then I really listen, they're not all there. They can't say the National Anthem, they can't say to keep an Anthem. There's some people I quite dare with us that when they're saying that, but they're not saying to the mumbling. It's a matter of fact, a couple of days ago, we had two of them and I kept telling them they were laughing and they were telling us that they were turned. the medical one of them tells me that he just came a couple of days from Havana and his other friends came from Cleveland, Ohio and he came to pick them up and they were going to do the self-peach scene and then they heard about it and he had him over and then listen by.

She tells me that people who left, you can not hear a part of your realization. She can't tell me very much about it, and I didn't think it's me. Only that 7,000 people are involved, and if they're all people, you don't want to pass me trouble. It's a happy experience to try to sort of bear people out. We don't want anybody, especially. and he said, and he said, I can't shoot. So you look at how you might be saying, I can't shoot. But still, in the situation, that yes or many people come in better or so. Yes. As Rita whispered, how grandmother did we press conference? He's laughing and congratulating himself on his throat. As Rita put to see her first turn into conversation. She tells him that she goes to college, I am dead. That's been times  you made me shoot. Can you see her? I'm very good at it. I look at this.

The boy should be with the power. , of course, but they're not seeing the whole story. They don't want to be too busy about wondering when the portfolio is grown up and down. The whole story doesn't mean that. 3-Dest Grandfather was killed by the death, which he was saying before. This isn't clear. The man who sleeps in the last year next year says he watched the friends and neighbors in the Shingun with ditch lines out. The blind woman who stayed across the street says she was thrown into a mental institution for disinitly day. And it says it by saving this one boy, all this mystery will be between you and these people will find me just relax. have called me to this, ,  not to do this, but what in the past and future,  how to do it? That's just how some research here, right? Can I see the young man? And it's , I cannot believe him. Remember, I was raised in America. I didn't even see his old.

Instantly the mob was definitely not feeling the impression. Manning women are screaming playing rhymes and literally within seconds the peaceful first jer Overweight cameras, we met in the last area shorter and hit a flood block in the two of us. There's a lot of jostling in noise, circle people closest to man, people rest from the bottom of the island. Through the chaos, the mobs and huts you spread, they move the man working almost beautifully, down the streets of police presence and block where they deliver him, minus the sign plus drop macho through the in the car and speed away. Before the times they blocked the mob in the hospital. They wander backward to rest and cluster on TV as a parking site in the street. To watch the video itself now being practical or visual in the web blockings. As they watch the footage from the census of the hospital, the census which is little to do with what actually happened. And everything is due now they want what happened. This is the concern. The mob decides it's not a mob. We're having our peaceful demonstration, and we're having our prayers, and all of a sudden there's a man with a sign that said, Elian needs to go home. We're trying to take him to no feet without him. We're just in nobody heard him or anything. Walk them out. Walk with all the rest of the people. Walk them out here. We've stayed. They repeat this line and you get person laugh. This is after all, and for something odd, a media savvy party. A mob, certain issues, that even in the middle of an authentic expression of rage, their half-conscious and have at-rate work play, are both encouraged and constrained by that cosmic. In other words, a mob unable to entirely leave themselves in the afternoon and long. In the fading light, I stand and watch the men watch themselves very consistently wrong.
