Every morning when I wake up, at some point in time, through the morning, those numbers of the first things that pop in my hand. And it has been over two and a half years, but I still think of those numbers every day. They're not any significant numbers for the fact that if I didn't even pick the numbers, I'll have to compute or pick them. But they just... They're itched in my mind. 3,937,38040. Nothing long ago, Todd Power won $27 million from Florida State Library. I'll be till that pointy made us live in working long hours and next since now, on the last pipeline. Sad on the bed morning one. Watching these other members on television is bad, Pat. Ted North through Alaska. I tried to wait my wife up to tell her that I did the library and when I woke her up she fell and I was sitting too. grab the computer and threw it over head and just didn't want to hear it. And I told Russ said, well, if you were looking at my heart, you can tell that I'm not fiddling to you and you could actually see it in my neck, mean. I felt  it was just fixing about it's playing out on my chest. Money changes things. And a lot of money changes a lot of things. People thought it was hard to know this whole life when nervous talking with them. strangers wrote asking for money. Sometimes real automates. There were family troubles. Right after the lottery, the woman that I was married to just started seeing changes, dramatic changes. In fact, she kind of looked at it a little different than I. We had only been married and she just looked at it as well. There was this big power money there that I can just do whatever I want to. Good and sleep at night, could need lost 26 pounds, only weighed 154 at when he won the lottery. There were fights of money with his wife, they got divorced. He lent friends money, who not only had never paid a bat, they avoided him. They got indignant when he asked for the money and saying, he couldn't possibly miss a few thousand bucks. He changed his raw bat. I've made him got a little harder, I don't know because a lot of times now when people start,  with him. played hard stuff,  where it's fixed the file and it kind of just makes you where your brick wall goes up, , in your own mind, , this brick wall stores for. Well, today in our program, WinFalls and Power of Money, the good and bad over our own lives. Heck one, reservations, the story of an entire community that is turning its back on a And why that might not last? Back to. But baby, it's cold outside. Right or down, savage and how a windfall check you got in the mail. Starting his family life. That degree. Money is good. I won't want him run to stop worrying and start spending spending spending. Back for. Out of gold. Scott Carrier tells the story of someone's life that improved with a huge insurance settlement. Even though the money never arrived. Stayless. That one, reservations. Nine years ago, a Native American tribe in Minnesota, Milax Band, which I've played, built a casino. The reservation had been poor for a century, soon they were the second biggest tourist attraction in the state, the economic and the mall of America, so they had hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's unclear what to do without that cash. Now we speak off. Thank you. It's 8 o'clock on a Monday morning, and there are 1000 people on the floor of the Grand Pesini. A thousand people who shower, brush their heronities, put on clothing and travel of some of the insignificant distances to the greenery. Whether now pouring money into slot machines within enthusiasm, I usually associate with it in the evening or more. I've been told a number of times that people run in the green, that I'm not supposed to interview the senior people since we've met here for a year. So I change aside and walk around with the birth of four of Nichols trying to work. I sit down next to a gray hair's man in the quarters lie and get as far as the low before it tells me to go away and gambling. Which I'll do. I walk a couple miles of me when he goes in next door woman with two small pictures of her grandchildren trapped up in the different slot machine. Her name is Donald. She's 67 in travels every Monday from her home in our way to Ginn, home to Green. She plays from eight me long in the utility afternoon and then returns home to work at her job as partying in the delusion club. A couple times in lunch a community casino with him husband, a farmhouse, and even though she's 67 and he's 74, they'll stay up on her earphone. Unspecial occasions,  her birthday, though went to room with a hotel and storage. She tells me that the casino will laugh as soon. She says she's saw into you that they come special afterage into the air-ducks in the ceiling and she thinks it's not easy to do with it. I'm here to do a story of a happy grand-passining. About having social tools, I'd have dinner normally today. people  Donald have changed life on the YouTube web as a patient. So I try to interest them in a conversation about the people she's been feeding her picture to for the last two years. Donna is an interesting. She doesn't even remember the name of the tribe which owns the case. She,  the other thousand people sitting in the scene of world, is just here looking for reason. Of course, the odds are stacked in the house's favor, so they're pursued at this been called, seem to produce a win-puff or similar knel, the Ojibwe tribe. I will talk about this in town. and she works the buttons if we are approaching the song. But she just lies, keeps her eyes closed, the spinning clear screen and fanfare. And not from top. Okay, listen, this is brand new again, this road's left and here. So this brand new here, two lane road. Far, nice and far. and we were somewhere to see our homes, and we were looking to see the profits. No profit from this name. No, this is Ben Runevo, and that's me. Kenny Williams takes me on a tour of Georgia with a reservation to show me what's new. A lot of the students. We drive past the YouTube plus norms and a new road with new curvy and ministry lighting. We turn at the new water tower and circle the new spirit to the center. Kenny is a member of the LGBTQ trial and we turn while the native American is in. Our interview is set up by a PR guy who told me that Kenyna is his matured little boy as a new troll. His 57-in is little boy from his reservation only twice. Once after high school when he moved south of training the army, and again after his marriage when the reservation come to him so poor he had to move to Minneapolis to find work . All of this new dozens can end. It means among other things that he won't have to go away from the reservation thing. And as we pass each new building, he resets the date with Zopin. The museum made. in 1996. Can you help Connie to send it to our 19 1910? We idle in the parking lot, can you load scroll in my new platform? Then right down the street, to get another new CD won't go. And right up here to our left is our high school. Yeah, so no one to read that team of the same time, the same time that low school. And if you go inside and you go inside and they got a new new record. your church windows, dig at that, if you color, you need to go to the window and find the panorooker. Skylight. So it's beautiful inside and look up to that dome. As we circle to exit the school parking lot, I noticed a first-eaning double-eyed trailer touches the home of the school selling room. It has colored paper pieces between two things. It's such a pretty sound. That's the old cool, yeah. You can try to build some. It looks  that. It's a little home, right there. Yeah. Bye. You're more than sense of sense of case in a team and now everybody won't be seen. Even when play is a... Yeah, minimum wage is 7-9. We're going to see them team and we need to achieve the overalls now. Then we drive people into this equation. We pass. the lack of territory in some kind of something. What's that? I have some people who are all people, so, , there's still, you still got familiar. People that live in, well, big-time figure house, big-time homes, no one, not everybody, not everybody that might have known. Kenny doesn't seem much about working down problems in public housing. We're just a classroom, we can give you very class moments at the ceiling. There are beta trails, trashed in the arms, little kids walking there between broken grass and dry soil, and the general feeling that things aren't flowing in. The Niagara of Money pouring into slot machines across the street, it isn't reaching everyone. And this in anywhere is the choice of traveling down the street, which takes a new trip to the school. Of the 545 new people that can drive some interest, about two million tonnes of cash. But most of these are Christians. to the American Transantry Competition in Geneva. Only a few around 5% generates new deep problems. The Ojibwe are one of these jobs, so are the national team of people I am in, and new to business, the Shafi-Trak, who haven't seen you just south from the Apsi-Pri-Mbe. But the few quite in the Shafi-artines are very different, they are distributed in the province, to the members on the per-topic basis, which means that each one, every tribal member is checking with their pair. share of any busy problems. We tried to don't publicize how loud these checks are. Publish the accounts which the Shack can work in some, say that each Shack can be exploding to 50,000 dollars a month, which is a lot of money. And I should say here, the Ojibwe tribe could never offer any of these things about science. Although it still be a lot of needs, it's conservative estimates are about 10,000 per year that mean travel and try. I asked him if he could first. He's missing. and destiny , moving some search for answers to your journey. And he doesn't pass by. He doesn't want to know. I don't think we'll run here. We can, we go  that. We can run back to him. I think you're always hurting, where you did not need anything. That's how we engage in that easy. He goes back into input settings, set of our. the mother check every month for the month. Over the next couple days I got from them from the country. Nice meaning in the middle class people set up some of that here in the satin just in the east. And whatever I asked them whether they didn't want money, saying they're from the capital teams. Their faces tightened and they just get chalone. And they all say no, they don't want anything to do with anything. any day a luge and go. and I can understand that all things are usefulness, so joblessness, alcoholism, and drug things. It's a difficult and embarrassing thing to talk about, because it plays into a mystery of types of that need and more of a small problem. Because they're basically saying they think they could handle money, but they worry that their family and neighbors can. When I press one woman directly to the way she thinks about the things she does to me, she does need to turn off the tape and put her in. Then the means for it were from the teleconcitor for us in the next. she tells me is dangerous and this is why I can do everything. Early in the evening I could drive along the reservation. In front of a row of pet homes I find two teenagers, Marcus and Leslie. As I drive up there running circles around in order land was clearly in the evening. The laughing, waving their hands in this phase. Tanteman is a dress to make his way down the street. I rolled down my window and asked to the small one, Marcus. made their terrorizing drugs. So I get out of my rental and we stand together on the street, watching the cars, pals, talking about the cinema. Basically, marking time into another victim's business style. Marcus and Wesley earned him press with the testimonies accomplished for their community. They hold forth on the thesis that everyone on the reservation is still poor and still tired and then having anything and that everyone except the government wants per capita payments. As we talk in other old man's style, we stand the street towards us. He is two young girls with the other one. This upper arm tightly, you try to steer him away from the current. The younger ones get behind and you fall in pain. Almost entering his feet. Instance, we're going to leave for task. If you got captive, then just give us your hands. Asking what do you think? I'll be what you think about the rest. Okay. Thank you. So said. You made my ass off, you made my ass off! Shit! We wait some more. Every time I try baseball, Marcus wakes up from some new song. I ask who it is, he doesn't exist. That doesn't look  a girl. Two peasants pass, three peasants do house, four peasants pass. Who's that guy? Little mama. Is there a need of God? Pretty soon another secret strike is 10-word in that range. It's where this does not go to last. I think I'm gonna be the same one. But let's do my favorite lesson. , answer some questions. But what? I think the rest should give per caps. No, it was. But mine is both. When I knew my wallet, I should be giving you something bad. Yeah, I think you're getting it. No, we're not. Let's check this one, man. There's  three families living in one house all over the place. living kids. Bill used to work at the scene of the gut laid off. Now in this week of family he says can't spawn. He gets by and will protect. Everyone agrees that about half the track wants to come up. And it's people  Bill, people who are worse dog. We tend to want to meet. If you think you got a mate down here, we do not got a mate. It's hard live here. We've seen that seeing you've gone here is harder for us to live Because we're expecting to live over now After a while we have to start thinking about we're all this money going there we go So that one that This is a thank this job. It's... My name is the chief leader of the great tribe. She's a small woman who sits in a large office, and both perhaps a decent man. A small girl, green, big and have a new death, a mug with the appropriate observation that would bust up and picture. My chief built me and my chief's stern scene, my chief's smile and a giant couch. My chief's been tribal chiefs since 1991 and seen an open. She's the person who's decided to be trapped in the prison and the world and through sheer force of belonging to the reservation much better place than the world's teams. She's also the main opponent of distributing property for capital teams, though it's such a sensitive issue right now that when I ask her about it, she tells me to move to people. Finally, I get her to send this in the team. I see, I see for what's happening. These other communities where you have alcohol problems, you have drug problems, you have just dependency problems where . It's just I think it's self-defeating. Marge knows that many people in the tribe want drug drugs. She even knows this may cost her her child. In the last election, the tribe voted in the new Secretary for Human and the Capital Plot Fund, and I'm going to seem to give more to seeing more and more drugs in the tribe's moments. and Marja's worried that he might disrupt the work she's thinking. And she's getting tired. She's sad and tells me that the job takes too much time. She's frequently away on the things. She says she's a flakedo-granching and won't know me. In addition to the problem of trying to convince a group of people who are poor, that they should not work themselves more money. She's now fending off her white neighbors, who are threatening to take her to the casino and to see her profits entirely. Yeah, if he's for a pizza itself, and one of these days, the casino's gonna be gone, I mean. Some way, somehow, some is going to find a way to take it away from us again. I really believe that because I mean the way things are going right now, I mean, now we have a compact with the statement of soda that allows us to do this. In that compact is perpetual, there is no ending data on it. And we now you have those at one to renegotiate. Let's open up that compact. And  what? What they want to open up the contrast so they can break it again. And... One of the things that these negotiators said was, , had we known these transfer going to be that successful? We would never had, , signed a compact with them. So what does that say? They wanted us to fail again? , I mean, it's... I know it. It is frustrating and it just, , I sit here at some times, I just say what the... It is a use, . In part, it is this past week. It is a week. in a deep and way to give such urgency to Marcus opposition to complete payments. She feels the treadmill's use every scrappy money that they have to do first by their economy, creating the economy that is not dependent on the city. So she's buying pizza franchises and investing in bottled water, and generally pouring the tribes money into industries which aren't simply to do the real estate budgets. She feels there is a window here, just to briefs the bedtime.

When look at us and they charged twice, I'll get into watching my sheen. What would you have to keep creaking? Actu, maybe it's called outside. Now the story of how I said it. Inflot's money affected one otherwise happy home, that if I'd ever danced to average and see I'd owe wanting to some listeners, the and matches the fact that is a homosexual. The check came in the mail, I didn't even do to see it. We were not to hold with my hand and marvel at the string of zeroes that came before the decimal point. My boyfriend Terry deposited the check in zip but we're any object that came in the mail to Howard House. Howard Money goes straight into Howard joint checking account so we never got to see Howard check. This wasn't  any of Howard. other chats. This was the single largest chat I've ever made out of money and it didn't arrive and the yellow one on the love book and the announcement. I write a sex advice column and a book publisher got this crazy idea that they might make money from themselves by publishing collection My Old Colons. On the expectation that they would make money, the publisher gave me some of our real-world columns and short before the book came out and sent me a chat. I don't have it in me to tell you how much this check is for. I couldn't stand to hear from people that I got paid too much or too little. And it's hard for me to talk about money anyway. Money was scarce when I was a kid. My parents had four kids in Catholic schools and races and paying for long Chicago Cops Seller and wasn't agitated. Conversations about money were in the pleasant. My family avoided talking about money just when they were talking about a trip. grandma home seems to me. So I can't bring myself to tell you from which this one called came to, but I will say this. It was in the load of high mid by fingers. Okay? It was 10 times as much money as I would be here I can be 30. Enough money to make me feel some money, mention the bills from the doctor. Terry told me to check you. You had to lie down in the dark room for us for the afternoon. Before the money had a chance to settle into our check in the account, get acquainted with one thing money was on there, my boyfriend Terry was making plans to spend it and spend all of it. Terry likes spending that, especially our money. Which I  to think of as my money since I run it. But I have to push these thoughts out of my head to let Terry regard my money as his. That's the deal we made and we decided to adopt Terry quit working to stay at home for the baby for a couple of years. We're having a family deal fashion rate. I really should ship with the exception between two pieces staying very traditional. Terry stays home too. care of the baby,  while the world can make the mother. In other words, a stay at home bag, a good work bag, and one will be a baby sexual orientation can determine that on your day. As Terry sees it, it's my job to make money and his job to spend. I, however, can ask me. What I was growing up, spending money, is just as painful as talking about. More. My mom would drive off for us out to the sears at Irving and Westernish, Karthan from the beginning of the school year. While my brothers and sister ran around, Olivia's two-ups actually went on, sensitive little family would see the tortured look on my mom's face, as she realized she couldn't afford that to school clothes for all of us. Then I'd watch a pullout or serious credit card, praying it wasn't maxed out and handed in the sales card. On two occasions when it was just mom and me, her sears card was maxed out. Seeing my mom turned... and read and say no when the clerk asked us to she could be a cashless partner. To this day, I hate to shop. You don't do malls, apartment stores, and teaks, or even catalogs . High-tech options are better. I could have the same sick feeling surfing in the virtual gap, but I could get walking into an actual gap. The Terry loves to shop. Traditional enough to begin with our relationship is never quite so comically traditional as it is when we fight a problem. Or I should say when we fight about how to respond to them. My money. After the baby came to every stop working, I thought I'd managed to power some sense in this. You couldn't live paycheck to paycheck now that we had a baby. We needed money in the bank, kissed the baby, got the key in our simple thing. I did. Terry saw the logic and we agreed we would both buy less and save more. That's not how it worked out. Buying less is enough for me as I never bought much to begin with. Spending money, including money, do not have. Was always Terry's hobby. The Eastern Terri was taking the baby for walks through old and maybe, and Nordstrom's in Barnes and Noble. The baby was asleep at home, Terri was getting her line and buying CDs. Now this is where it gets common. Sit, comment. Think Lucy and Ricky. Since he knows it makes me angry when he spends money on stuff we really don't need, clothes, shoes, music. Money we might need at the baby around getting a chemial or something. My boyfriend always hides. and I find a shopping bag hidden behind our old clothes full of brand new clothes where box new CDs. All I Ricky Ricardo I stormed the living room and asked and I apologize I didn't even ask him to buy a seat in the box. Honey what is this? They're being up back. All I'll lose he required no Terry to nice ever having seen the bag. Well, how did these get in your closet then, I asked? I don't know, Pouts Terry. Oh, Lucy, I exclaimed, Waaaaaaaaak, cries Terry. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. These were the dynamics of play when the big check-mine, one with all known zeros. Our windfall took a bad situation and made it much much worse. In my mind, they had been a little gotten in Terry's hand, or checking account. Who came to me  bisa? It hit a bit up to me we wouldn't have deposited that share. After all we did cash it, compared us, we'll change it. So a few days after Terry deposited our check I hit something paid to be our goal, Harry Fawman was fast, something I'd  anything I'd ever done before. Out of our joke. checking account, I wrote myself a check in the full amount of my advance and deposited that check in the account only I had access to my old savings. I was afraid that if I left my money in our joy checking account, I went from disappear when I flew in while I was at work . Oh yeah, my new Terry spent the entire amount of whole loads of high mid-five figures at one wheel. I moved the money out of my work checking account that Terry made me stick to me what he wanted buy WebBuy…… I think that's a bad idea, several businesses. First, it appears the planet is about to follow during worldwide economic recession from depression. People tend to need less sex advice and more social. I'm concerned that the sex advice and business hyposuction and website design might dry up if everyone is standing and bread margins is jumping out windows. I'd rather have the money than pay. Secondly, I don't want to calm. I'm 34, I've never owned a calm. I don't know how to dry. I suggest to deter you that we buy a beat up. old car, something priced in O4 figures in high 3, but he insisted we needed a new car. Not for us, but for the baby. We need a safe car, a Volvo or something. The problem is no more shopping once we got it. And if me or the baby does come down with a keen military point about, we'll need a new car to get us back and close to our keen therapy appointments. And he swears that if we buy a car, we need nothing but decorating and cheese and we're holding racks and rest on our lives. war with my air voices. I can't drop. Terry has started shopping with the vengeance. He's reading books on smart car buying, visiting the internet sites and the advice from people experiencing buying cars. About Terry Shops, I'm worried. Early in our relationship when we first moved in with each other, one of my first official access to her boyfriend was to pay off his load to mid-low for a figure credit card debt. He was supposed to pay me back to certain not every month, but after three months I told him to stop. We'd already merged our checking account so to check he was writing me every month, came out of our checking account, and I would put the money back into our checking account and Terry would spend it. He was all a little silly so I told him to stop and I'd go to my room and bought myself a boy. It was time with us. I started thinking enough money that probably cannot work. I stopped joking about mine. Sometimes I worry that's exactly what I've got. Is Terry just a little windfall? I love Terry, but does Terry love me? Or does he love that having to worry? When you turn being at least about supporting me, so. Or if that's why he loves me? Is that okay? There are lots of reasons people love your partners. The notion that the only valid one is such a passion is pretty vivid. Maybe part of the reason. her loves ways because the checks come in the mail. And maybe that is a bit. More than any other force or relationship or even sex, I say this to you as a sex power. Money always seems to push people to the streets of their characters. Money turns ordinary people into characters. Money was a large part of what to serve in their character in. Stranger Now I find myself worrying that money concerns who makes it out spent, pressure by money, or there's your carries under the spend class will be long term harms my relationship and territory. Does the problem with money is that money problems are never just about money. They're about who you are. Right now in our house, they're only two options. You're either busy or busy. Dan Savage has been doing some way over the years with you hate and sex-by-searched column if you want some reason to destroy his personal life. You can do it. The bind is new book.

Then you can put them in the case. This is American light from our glass. Drinking a puzzle of course to steam You were a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. This can then win fall, but happens to you when you make the big score. That is, of course. And up until the point in this program, I have to say the model of every story has been very, I'm gonna say this. It's been very public-rated. That is the lesson of every story has been, money is scary. Money is bad. Money can lead to dangerous feelings and things and make people unhappy. So as an antidote to that, in this half of our program, we bring you stories, money actually doing people. with some good, we wrapped it at three of our show and three money. It's good. Picture is discovered. When Elizabeth was seven, her father, safer, and continued out system done, teaching table, and charging charts, and bar graph, showing what college tuition you passed by and time to them get your team. How much of that Elizabeth and her sister would be expected to pay themselves? She started learning. Take red work. And we took this in very, very seriously. And , I just sort of started with this. I just remember going to school the next day and sitting next to my friend San Diego and telling me about it seeding our seven years old and I said, yeah, I'm hungry. Ladies, that kind of cash. I'm only seven. What can I possibly do? I'm a petal petal. I'm a petal petal. I'm a petal petal. I'm a petal petal. I'm a female, poor state's way, same year, 1970. When my son, Sma'amaka Fiam, his brothers and his sister, he met a little bit of a night, dragged him down to their dining room, where their dad was seeing some people lunch balls. He drew a big breath and looked at his surfaces, and resurfaced paper bags, dumped about $20,000, and $20 bills out on table. Started into race, one perfect, but he did not put the weight. It's college, or invested. Hey, I'm going to get you a save-in bet. We recarpeted the house. We bought DCRs. We bought waterbeds for everybody. Waterbeds for everybody's phrase. I'm a snever here. Waterbeds. Not enough. Waterbeds grow all my friends. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Two decades later, this man meets this woman. situation, you just lost his job, you need to dream. Per situation, catajot, and bot. And the money came up pretty fast. Our very first conversation about money in fact was the first night that I met Liz and bot. And my friends and I got into drinking, drank all night and drank, so five, six, seven, morning. And when we were out of money and stuff and nothing left, but Lynch are potting. I said, well, listen, why not close down the bar and I'll take it all out to breakfast and she did. With all the money they can give me. Yeah. And so I remember at the end of the night I insulted my best friend Reggie and I won't go into detail there. But I insulted him and he got up any left and so I was left there. He was a little bit village without a way to get home. And I remember asking him, is it  a bar of $10 again? Oh. She obliged. But no, that's my kind of deal. It was actually, I gave it to him because I was sure that I would be able to see you get the other money. Did you get it? No, is there anything in that first interaction which indicates the overall direction and the way the children remember much? Just everything. I never really met somebody before my husband spent money quite the way that he did. And he's... I was raised with this incredible further back and who I was had this amazing anxiety about me. And I was always so amazed when I was hanging out with him. , really go to restaurants every day. , or you send your laundry out and you teach boxes everywhere. , there's just sort of no, they didn't seem to be any. I just had that, I've had it excited about my life, something that's given to me at very young age. It hasn't really taken that. And so, never quite sure that you're not going to starve, that you're not going to be turned out on the street. I've always stood just my leaders, but someone blows give you money. Money can comment, and you're  an unexpected waste, and some ways are something to dig to. You do have a car. It's about a much situation, though. Well, I got a car. I think if you're an example, I mean, I think probably the biggest money decision discussion that had was when we got married. And now, and there was some money that we could put aside from my dad, he could say, I'm ready, my whole life for college education. And for whatever reasons, some scholarships, and they said, there was a small amount of leftover from her. She told me, I could have when I got married or whatever. There were 30, 30, and I just knew I just knew in my heart that my parents' lives, I didn't think. And I knew, knew, knew, knew, knew, knew, knew. So deep in that, didn't want to see that much of it. And it was kind of the only money we had. We weren't dead, but we didn't see it. It was a nice little nest. It would have started off. And I mean, , for married couples to start a small question. And they also, it was just an opportunity to see it. It was a nice, little nest. What have started off? And I mean, , for married couples to start a small question. It was just an opportunity. have a nice little wedding and which I wanted but couldn't get over this idea of it that this money was lots of respect and we and Michael was fine had no problem about that spending every last cent of it on what he felt  he was important to do to have everybody who wanted would be on the day I just could get over it  and it was causing so much fun about it cried about it we  suffered over it and at one point I had decided forget it we're not spending this money for a big wedding we'll get my current spec American We'll have pulled park sandwiches, play music, record, play, and then we had this big revolution. So, it's a team I put, but that means we won't have a band, that means we won't dance. And what if for the rest of our lives, whenever we go to a wedding, we see other couple of dancing. And every time I see it, it tells me that we did something. He got down on his knees and he took my hands and said, I won't tolerate it. I won't tolerate it. We have to spend the money. And we did. And I think that in many ways, Michael is always just what I needed as far as showing what's more important than how we can possibly get to the next stage. No, if your parents would have told us story today, would the theme of the story be a match where she fell into the hands before Sir. Evil? That was the turning point. No, because everything, I mean, the thing that Michael said at the time was you don't know what's going to happen. Maybe that will be the last 10,000 balls you'll ever ever have. Or maybe, , six months from now you'll send a book or I'll get a great job and we'll have the times of money to look back and say we could have a wedding. You should just do what you want to do because you don't know. So your pants would fly and breathe soon. Possibly because of the fact that it's a good one. Just such a good one as well. Of course I would do all the way and do it for 100. That's just this beautiful, cool thing. And money was in there, he's never been the same thing as the last. But I mean to fight, to get back to be able to kind of getpai served some kind of His Gilbert is ready to bunker ourselves.

I said, sure, moved in, or rather I opened the door, set my backpack down on the floor. First night I was there on a neighbor from across the allele, home for a visit. This was about 45 years old, six foot two, three seas sold over the air, comb straight back, glasses, thick lenses and in size and huge, six-day stubble, black, so obscure, 16-ounce buff. and welcome to the name. Found on the corner of the city, got two old lesbians, nosies, and pierce, they just put up to security lights and shine straight in my bed. In the next door there's Crazy Hag from Tennessee, drink thunderbird all day and scream to their speed, drink some grop, get a job. I've been here longer than anybody. It's my mom's house, but she was in San Francisco, and I'm in Hotech. I'm running that film, the conversation. Yeah, I said it's one of my favorites. Here he caught, sleeps in his raincoat. That was an awesome mood, he said. Flesh bitch down to him. No, I said it turned out that it was all set up and actually two lovers killed the rich husband. Whatever, he said it.

And tell him, it's a goodest done. You just asked Bob. Yeah, I said, okay. But things are going pretty good right now. Thanks anyway. I got it to house, throughout any walls. are home of the moon, stripped 12 layers of paper on the others, ripped up the carpet, broke the windows rear of me, opened for the first time decades. I kept only the refrigerator and stove slept on a pad of floor with a straight kidnastic neck or a face pad let it. Bob would come over every day, drink beer, smoke town mouths and watch me work, offering advice. In the beginning, had a friend scheme. Clarence. About 60 years old, quite hair. who was just holing up a policeman prison for John's wife that bruised it because she was a witch. They come over with folding lawn chips, sit drink beer, listen to jazz on my cake plate, there were box tubes, he had John cold train, mouth Davis, and that cloth. No other guys  that's well. They drink two or three beers, Bob will get up, move around, not dance, but move it to music stage. Do that, shoot that man. Ahs. this. There are three beers, four beers, somewhere around two six packs that they'd be yelling at each other, making no sense what's with why carried out laugh and clasped through a pile in the yard. Clients did sure we'd go to prison. The state kind of country and even wrote me letters saying I'm a good man. And I should try not to make the same mistakes he had. , kill my wife, boomstick. But that all in all, prison wasn't so bad. Thank God every day he wasn't. for my sheep or sheep. These men have nothing to look for. Get beat up and be some man's girlfriend. So clearance was gone and the old woman can't see just as long or around one day. And I just let Bob and me to them down in the corner. We would sometimes stop by and yeah Bob and ask me all kinds of fun questions Who is my mom anyway by the house from? Why do  I have a job? Why did I let that bob come over and bob? I said it's true, I don't  it's a blonde but it gets covered up pretty quick by the cigarettes, beer birbs and then I do, I actually  it's music besides, as long as I'm with that he's worthless, absolutely garbage Bob and Hadjogs, plastic junks, concrete instruction, last beat, installing fiber glass insulation, but he heard his back falling on the ladder. This kept idle around, this filled. The only way he got by and all is that, despite due of jobs, with me. He wanted me to get used to hitting. I found it hard to breathe, but I actually kissed him. Did have a Sara shot, kept standing. next is for a doer. Just a stare at it, want to pick it up. That was a problem. your troops, where do you need some guys, lovers? But then they'd come over when I had an 11-clop, not even drunk. Have a royal look to sleep, black shirt, white hat, shake, shake. You said he just wanted to say goodbye. It's not around for one. Sounds huh, Black and it'sюkey. That time came back. He was there the next day sitting in my living room while I was being. He never said it thinking that what we had. But a few months later he's gone. 10 days. I got baby Zon Ron. Turned out he'd been in a hospital with broken legs. He got over top stop and then he got a beard. I'll sit by a drunk drive. That's the hospital piece. Get a cat. Scratch. I said, sorry, you said, no, well, it's the best thing we're gonna have. Sure it hurt,  bass, again, then they shot at us one. Now, let's see the sun, which everything has. My lawyer said, $800,000. Maybe, I'm rich. The accident changed, Bob's life, for better and for good. He decided to go to trade tech, study draft, head to the ground. He had to take some man loose right. Come over with this one. Test the show, how well he's. Use proud of himself. He even had a girlfriend, both one. Women is age, and it's school who's studying bigger town. And she took out the trove. This wasn't bad for him. It wasn't the worst part. She was. He was. He was. He was. He was. As soon as Bob's lawyer told him, he started to think about what he was doing while running. How he's been spared. He had a list on paper. Two Harley Davidson's, an electric ride and a sports pickup truck hauled around. New four-way stereo's, a 500 watt, gentle amplifier, six-foot high-jb-o-loud speakers. The elaborate handcarp bar, drink, and then the Canadian strength. And a new hop. A rather key to rebuild this press for small brick box. By first raising 15 feet off the ground, steel IBs, and installing electronic trap door for new instruments. The new is going to take off as roof and add another three floors of top, but go to style. Headed drawn out and all the mentioned angles, 60 foot tall, but go to the dragons and flames and flare out from sloping cables. Everything can be found, frame, and cable inscriptions. He had these drawings laid out on the sketching table, and carried the list of things to write in the shirt pocket, so he can add some track to you day by day, aren't by none, aren't on. He came in open, then several notebooks. And to me, it was  he had the scenes, the mental illness where these things, all these things, and gone in this mind, and being objects of desire, to actual material things, already in this possession. He kept his hair cut, which he used his clothes, he stopped with. clones, he stopped from an open spend day, he was a new man, because he had a long stop. Didn't actually have any.

As you can see, but  that, Luke had been down his search and draw... darba singing. After the accident, the green had to go dry, it was actually better to go. So I think it's difficult to justify a large compensation. Then I don't know what happened, as far as to sad, rest and talk about it. Then one day he was gone. He left me in the same system. But it's not difficult to do that. It's not difficult to do that. school out of the state. There was seen a group in the center. I hope it's still not carrying that mess.
