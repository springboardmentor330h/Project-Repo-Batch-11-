We know that in many of the countries where our messages are sent that are off in your distorted, their one dimensional, are they're simply not her. This is Charlotte Bears, formerly of Madison Avenue, taking what is certainly a colossal pay cut under Secretary of State and Charity Disabled. There's not many of these things. She's announced that far are eminently sensible, better communication with far and journalists, stay in programs and more people from the Muslim world, if you need and know real Americans. She talks weird. I mean, I know I'm not talking, but she speaks, you need to be particular, kind of , she is, in a press conference, talking about Muslims in America. Their conversion rate is astonishing, 30% conversion, and each year is about... the fastest growing religion in the East Africa. And a good number for any sales team. Here's a sales curve, any corporation would end in a reason that for the sake of mass economy in the US on the last few years. It's obviously a growing vital religion with some very wonderful people who have a great remarkable life here at the world. You consider all the difficulties the United States faces in the separate to win the hearts amongst around the Muslim world. It's an improvement what it takes to do a regular advertising campaign. Do something as simple as so long-dried and sturdy. Muslim Afghanistan and Pakistan. Up until very recently, it's an income round of it. It's based in Karachi, with global ad agency such in Sachi, and Sachi. Charge with selling Thai. For Ryzen't Thai, please, have aardsco on Aaron. Ouriel, me this for Hand Washing. since only 1% population is actually a question machine. She's working in that part of the world with unlike any advertising sheet ever done. For me, everything that you knew as a principles advertising is something that and you that the head of the media should get them out. But I get a dissent review with our show and find National Public Radio program on the media. Because we are facing with different types of consumers. I mean the average salary path. the real one is $5 per month. The literacy rate, the real one, for women is 4,5 per cent per man is higher cost than 7 per cent. There was a fact that although it was women who watched poems, it was man who made the purchasing decisions. Women didn't read magazines, it didn't seem much TV. So, think I had a product book that you couldn't advertise. So the adagency did a focus with and was sort of taken a back when six women, legally covered in black, hemidotopathy church and about the ads, the agency of St. Leronic. , we expose them to certain commercial, which is just one of the gates and from the police. And after, , showered in the constants, asking them to tell us what do they really think and which one would they choose? What they said is, that they wouldn't use any. me, me, yes, right, they said because, , you just can't visit me, don't believe in this father because it's too expensive. They know and they have perception that your brand is expensive because for in each, this is  it's not good. And , I remember me, I just got home, I was back in the office, and I didn't know what to do then, called to people working with fishing planned in Dubai, not on Continuep... to do it because they are not listening to the sound of the sound. So here's how they turned the area in the new camera into the number one S selling detergent in these Muslim countries. First, they decided that the brand's power in this was a problem. If the power in this made the area untrustworthy, then they needed to use as a local spokesman people that everyone would trust, to make local people. He had agency gave them a lot of useful wealth and then found a partner, a great experience. We wanted to create the story about unfortunate people and how our community contributed to better life. So created the real stories for example using the guy and in fortune room and really with his children in the end he'd spoof to offer them education because , the two main hopes for the people are to get to the daughter's married and to get the son, Ejuki. This is what we did. We just as the guy talking from the camera that, , he wants to educate his children, he is for men and for him to do it with one job. This is by Hikik. actually has a good few jobs and because you're not having enough clothes is right helping by watching this area  to impeccable in working to jobs and here is the hope for the future. in the hearts of minds be seen people. Well, as I think it says that the US needs to let people know that it is on their side, seems very out there. And this is where it gets tricky. Because, after all, in these countries, plenty of people are mad at the United States because they believe that we are intatically not on the side. We do things that they disagree with. The support goal group governments that don't , got bombs and sometimes it's billions. We give money and arms to the state of Israel. And so there are people that we are not going to persuade. Obviously in marketing in general good advertisements cannot compensate or hold the product. Tim Kulert is a professor of marketing at the private business school and either case studies have a market products in the Muslim world. So they will end down a PSR or a set of individuals in each of these Muslim countries advertising will not be able to achieve anything with because So the policies will still not be perceived as being South's factory. The problem here is more than a communications problem. It's a problem that relates to policy. It's a problem that relates to the degree to which, most of all, that they don't know the United States. Here's what beginners we are at selling ourselves in this Muslim practice. Tuck out just we don't even have much basic polling. data, tells what people think of us. How many people hate us so much that they will never be the sweet. How many might be open to hearing? Our side of things. This is in my opinion, a generation long after. And as our nation invites on this campaign, hearts and minds, we thought here that this American life that it might be helpful to broadcast on the radio, a cautionary tale or two. Stories of people in wartime, trying to win hearts and minds. With some points started to believe the wrong propaganda, which I guess kind of... occupational hazard. And the last important battle is because of that. I've taken today in two ads, act one, go believe anything you hear on the radio. And then act we bring you what we believe are tapes that have never been broadcast in the United States. Takes of a contest and radio station that CIA set up back in the good old battle days of the 1950s or with their central American government, which they succeeded in doing, using the immense power of radio. Unity. Got that it CIA. Yeah. way. Back to live on stage by the sword die on stage by the sword in that act story of wartime, rapsuaries and soft interest, leaving one's own publicity and a 50-year campaign for hearts and minds that was better known as Bob Hope USO Tour. Stay with us. At one, don't believe anything you hear on the radio. But let's begin our show today with what was considered sort of famous there. So, , to be one of our nation's most successful campaigns to learn parts and parts, in retrospect it serves as a kind of best case and worst case. But if I'll take a contest in radio station, the CIA set up over throughout the government of Guatemala back in 1951. In the late 1990s during a brief period when the CIA was defasted by cold one of the current, tapes to this contest in station, the class of our next day of our Saturday non-profit booth. the country's national security archive. The best we can tell the states never been broadcasting in the United States, and that's the effect of the process. The democratically elected president of Guatemala, Hacobo, are bent, did a few things to get on the wrong side of the United States government. For one, the tangles with very powerful American company called United Fruit, they grew and exported the nanas. They were also Guatemala's largest private employer and experienced landowner. And the Indian government is tahun Friday. thousand acres United Street owned in Guatemala were uncultivated and when our bends came to power, they started nationalizing the country's land, buying up tens of thousands of those uncultivated acres for nominal state and giving them out to peasants. United Food Complained to the US government, it is a height of the Cold War, our bends had communists among whose advisors and the US didn't want Guatemala to be from a Soviet each head. Guatemala after all was only a four hour. flight to Orleans for representatives from Ohio darkly reminded Congress. Because Eisenhower didn't want to seem  he was intervening in another country's affairs, the Center CIA. They were given a couple of old airplanes to fly over the capital to scare people, drop looselets, and very rarely fall. The CIA had a different price than much more power. A disgruntled Lieutenant Colonel in exile in Rostio, Armas, the CIA, dubbed him the Liberation. The military, the Rostio Armas, had, which the CIA, which, the weather for, was a rag tag force. This is Nick Grace. I'm going to tell you who he is. This was essentially an army that was too close.

Radio Liberation. Liberation Radio. And it was basically re-quadamallung guys with the CIA crew. it funded and trained with psychological warfare. This information propaganda scare tactics. For May 3 July, 2004, these guys went on the air to tell Guatemala about the bold, homegrown liberation in Arnaugues, movement to the country from the Iron Biblical International Communism. This is of course, a lie. There was no homegrown liberation. Only a CI hey, bye. We essentially was. elaborate puppet show that was played out over the airwaves which brings us back to Nick Grace. He collects clay and dust and broad cast from around the world and is probably the only person alive who's listened to all of his before and the tapes of radio libidation. In passing backstage The North Papria Iniberthal. This was an air check. The announcer states, every Guatemala should have a seat. Symbols in the struggle of communist. God, Fatherland, and Liberty.

We was in the Brabler by the automatic pouch. So these very passionate patriotic exhortations to three Guatemala from some outside influence were all recorded in Florida. Yep, pretty much. up until mid-June. This broadcast was in fact one of the ones that was made in the Bush so to speak. So it was not recorded in Florida. No, this was recorded in the Nicaragua. Here the home on the audio? Yeah, what is that? They, they them set up...

The map shows the exact location of the target. Good luck, signed for hype man. They were essentially sending the message to the government that we have maps, we've got regions, we have already chopped up to Guatemala, 30 sectors, we've got a hype man, we're well-armed, we're ready to do our step. What was actually happening? Absolutely nothing is happening. An interesting thing. is that he says tomorrow at 9,300 hours you will receive your requested equipment. 9,300 hours. So no such thing. You can see that. What is that? Is it sort of a military clock? Or were they just they were just they didn't know what they were talking? They essentially didn't know what they were talking. I wonder if there was any CIA guy listening, he heard them saying, , 9,300 hours in just a minute. Oh, no, don't say that. I don't think, I think the CIA at this point is very happy with the results. Flight service I am here with the word of God. Here they are sending a quote and quote code message to the real army. He is saying, there is an important message. And here we go.

Molina is a serious man, now thanks. He's played Guadamala in 1980, very much life. He's a university. the army was routinely shooting people out there. Now he works as a transit for the U.S. I watched his face for reactions to the tapes, but mostly he just listened. You just laughed a little bit what you laughing at. Well I was laughing about the secret that we saw  it was very much in the sense of the war and the so on. It made us believe that we were so mad. We did believe that we were so mad. that they were missing. Second, we did it. We thought that someday we could probably be pouring one of the mountains close to the border to the Honduras. Everyone is thinking that in this case. When did your family realize that these parties weren't real? Well, most of what mothers really have is, many use.

There's one broadcast when it even staged a fake takeover of the station, and the government soldiers suddenly discovered their puffy crandestine outfit in the mountains, and it tried to run them off the air. The drama comes in the middle of a regular broadcast. The announcer's talking, and then all of a sudden you start to hear a little commotion in that room. ! He was hungry, so hungry, so hungry, so hungry ... Ok. Right wait, you will see the trailer rining. They have attacked him right now And you notice the announcer sounds unret Night blasted, Matt Lehiti, Matt Gran de Retoro transitoria. I'm rapidly there's an increase in the stuffling in the background. and it escalates to the table. Oh, right. And then silence. Station goes off the air. Leaving listeners to wonder what it happened. Two days later, radio-libression came back on the air and smuggly explained that although government bugs had tried to shut down their transmitter, the brave rebels ordered them. But no one should be behind them. The government has been a government of Guatemala itself and it was a success that cemented reputation, which is essentially a talented stage. It's hard to remember this today, but in 1954, the CIA was still a relatively young organization only seven years old, still in the midst of trying to find and justify themselves. When our Benzfeld, the CIA was a static. It's critics turned into fans. Eisenhower, in his memoir, called The Overflow of Arbonds, one of his proudest moments, the operation went down in CIA history as quote, an unblemished triumph. Nick Collethers, historian, CIA hired who years ago, to write an official internal history in the past. Collethers gave a full access to all documents related to what he wanted to do. He says that in spite of everything else they went into the operation. CIA tried to infiltrate the army and film its student uprisings, planes had increased their flights over capital. There was no doubt in the CIA's mind, what had made the critical difference. It seemed to the CIA, the radio had caused the government, President of the United States, and explicitly cracked the psychological. President of the United States left the President's powers, walked across the street, and came to see if Mexico and Abdicate. And that was a conclusion in the operation. And at that point, everything else was failing. The secret army that they had assembled was in full retreat. The air operations appeared nothing, having any results. The student groups that they'd organized to full met with value in the capital city, who held them round up, channels and executed. Nothing else was going, except the radio operation. So it seemed to them that the radio operation must work. But the CIA never did a serious analysis of what... happening one moment. And why it happened? They didn't talk to any what moments. They didn't even go back over their own operation in terms of what worked. They relied on after action reports provided by the agency called, propaganda guys with best storytellers, and their version of events stuck. In other words, the agency hired a bunch of liars, talking to live better, and then believe them. If you don't want your paintings planted on them as usual... It created a legend about types of operations that could be successful. To believe that, at very low cost, and it's very little loss of life, we could over-serve governments when used the right combination of military and psychological action. But it really also set up a whole repertoire to see how you can use to use today, take operations in Central America in the 1980s, the operations from Gulf War in Iraq, some of the operations known the way in Afghanistan today, it's the same set of ideas, small actions that create a climate of opinion within the country, leads to a feeling that they're doing. But this whole legend is built on a story that's not true. Our friends didn't design because the radio broadcasts sank to now. He resigned. because you could see that the United States would not stop until he was gone. Four months before the coup, the US pushed a resolution through the organization of American States, essentially giving it the right to intervene in Guatemala at Will. When our band's manager to get actual documentation to CIA plot against him and made the information public, the State Department denounced it as a desperate and transparent communist propaganda effort, probably mass demanded in Moscow. The US Press from liberal to conservative botanists. In his final days, Arbenz appealed to the United Nations Security Council, the US strong armed accounts and it voted not to him case. But even after all this, he still might have hung on. In the end, Arbenz only resigned with his frightened army sent words in the field that if he didn't step down, they would march to the capital and oppose him themselves. They too believe it was only matter of time. for the US for the change. It seemed the only people who didn't see it that way were in the CIA. Here's a story in this color. It's very hard for me to separate. A notion of force from national propaganda is about to end as old as that. I mean, now when Germans were attacking French among the national army, first let's sire. on the sugar-dive farmers, farms and cells are very important in the second of the research troops, the farmers, the farmers may run. So is that course? Is that propaganda? I think the people in the CIA are some of that as a propaganda. But I think a lot of people are taking fun of some of these forces and other appears. PLEASE! Polythers says there are plenty of situations where it's right for us to use both force and pumping in. Press to intervene in the affairs of our country. For one difference, or the current one, that's against it. The problem is that we're not so good at basing magnitude in that task. It's easier to destroy it and to create one stable over the long. term. In the CIA documents he examined, found that the agency's ideas about a future Guatemala in the US are actually best. Let's get to your even, and our ideas about what kind of government should come to run Afghanistan. In Guatemala, things didn't work out so well. The man the CIA deposed turned out to be the last truly democratic leader Guatemala had. Our mask, the man the CIA picked her a place our best, was assassinated three years into his repression regime. And since then it's been one long series of brutal military dictatorships, interest-bursts of short-lived attempts at civilian rule. Again, here's Raul Molina, who heard radio libido Sian as a child. I remember watching movie, I think it is Eisenhower, , being insane, but what Malah was meant to be. Now then, what Malah had been? the name of the Muslim to do and something. And if we came on example, the world that was the things that you should never do. After that, in relation, not single day passing what we were talking about. Which is that that is the question of religion, that it and more than 45 Once upon a time Icafaults the Wellington as a spirit of love. you without regotten heels with uniform bumper a sc ville winter clear radio-lubitasyon is an ounce in the resignation of our homes. It's a triumphance speech about how his overflows and victory were those fighting against harm control, but of course the announcer is working for our families. He says joyfully, radio-lubitasyon is now transmitting live from the liberated territory of Guatemala. Every single part of that sentence is absurd. Transmission is not live. It's not in Guatemala. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it in my own way. And I'm going to be able to do it in my own way. I'm going to do it in my own way.

This is American life. is a theme when you have write it at different kinds of stories on that theme. But, it writes in lines, so you have wartime propaganda efforts, and what happens when you start to believe in the problem? We come to the second act of Russian, to move on stage by the sword, die on some things. So, the cast of the movie, Oceans 11, which was co-need to the robbers, hit that demon in the rest, but going to entertain the troops, US-based and perk, it's not entirely either to coincide with the multi-million dollar pussy campaign. from the 7th and the 3rd. But going to Turkey, they will get some free publicity back home. Let's view it stars, pelling around, cheering troops, DVDs of the film, the 7th, 11th, grateful warships in region. All which brings to mind this story, which are to the end of March, right? At the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, during the period when US forces were moving in, but no fighting would start here. Lots of soldiers out in Southeast Asia are not in the middle of nowhere. actually living and sleeping in battle for me isolated from the outside world. So general Norman Schwartz cough contacted Steve Martin, the actor and committee, and asked him to keep a go to the Middle East. That's how Martin is then why the British actress Victoria Tenon ended up on their very own mini USO tour. They flew to a Saudi Airbase near the Kuwaiti Front Martin and for about a week they'd awaken it down, get into a troop, carry your helicopter along two pilots to meet. Sheen Gunners in a special Marie S. Court made visit soldiers stationed along the Iraqi Kuwait Court. Every tournament is a surveyed land, and Steve Martin would climb on top of the team and about 75 soldiers who gathered around and for about a quarter of an hour the committee would just leave. He climbed around, had to question his side autographs, close for pictures, whatever. Not wine to be just the Tattoo on why Victoria Tenning came up with the glass, she'd moved to the C free repository. out collecting names and telephone numbers from the soldiers along with messages that she could relay to their loved ones and she got home. It was such a simple idea, but coming from this rich, framework and British woman, it must have seen an expect and therefore, W.E. They opened up the. Single fathers asked her to call their children and say, you're daddy, lugs. Movie married men wanted her with their brides now, how much they were met. They took the story at 10 o'clock days. and the best thing about this story is that you probably never heard. And the reason why is because Steve Martin and Victoria Tenet didn't warrant public schools. It was a pure and selfish act which brings us to Bob. Bob, of course, from USA Social, has sent me. There's hearts in mind, and two friends, servicing and got a piece of money. And people back home were reminded what great guys Bob wrote, Bob wrote, Bob wrote. Now we at the American Life have no doubt at all. Bob, never them at a George Pini bread pit are all great, great guys. But we were curious about the intersection, public service, self-interest, and curves to the US. Here's a guy when Hop is still visiting. Mark your rock, pop, and that's what he got at. My answer to collateral, paid stock. It's nice. As best as I can figure, it's guarded in a snap or bob. Bye night. 1941 Bob Hopes 3-year-old radio show who made him the top radio star in the country. Just before the war broke out, a representative from Pepsi-Den, the toothpaste company who sponsored the show, suggested to a reluctant hope that he entertained the G.A.I.S. at the March Field Air Base in Riverside, California. Hope said now, we didn't think it was a good idea. Nobody listened to it. Next, two days, I was crawling on a bus. Going to March Field. Cranks flying to Jerry's lungs. skinny at us in the band and the audience was set session so much so to us. Wait this ends. We started doing every week. Kind of from San Diego and folks in San Sonso. Everywhere around here, climate, September, square blue. Now it's too mad. We were for five years with baby sys. That was the most sensational thing, most emotional part of my life. That's what he was in a forward class. Hope had never had an audience who spawned him away the Jigiat's death. This 1990 memoir, Don't Shoot, it's only me. Hope explains that before he began the USO tours, his producer's equation for a radio show allowed for 23 minutes to build some music. Three minutes for commercials and roughly three minutes for rap. After, but Hope's bits went up with so huge of the army camps that they had to be figures the last time in six months. From the next 50 years, Hope took his show all over the world performing on the flight decks of aircraft carriers and out in the jungle on hastily constructed stages. He was there during every war and major military action from World War II. You have ever got to the Berlin AirLift and the Korean War. And now this seconded for three division occupying Korea.

The Bob Hubs career, you have to remember that he's already the most popular star on radio and movies in the beginning. One of his biographers Bill Fade said the USO gave Bob a popular even  school which would not even have been touching. He gave mission a national group. And for a long time, Bob Hubs, doing the USO tour was a balance of cheerful patriotism and it has us. until 1954 in the balance shifted and the business side of things to come to Rome run for us. 1954, when Bob hoped we'd get in the tradition of taking U.S. O's shows in Selina, told him special suspense. Arguably they were the corners found on which he built the last 40 years in the world. A common misconception about the U.S. O's shows, said they were... money for yourensation, which isn't true. In fact, there's always been controversy about who paid for one. Bob Hope says he paid all production costs and even lost money in the locker, but it's not fair to have. The actors basically don't need their time, although the USO says, occasionally paid them a small couldean, and everyone agrees that the panic on paid, the transportation must lodging for the bulk of the bills. Now remember, Hope will not be for just £1.00. and be sick. But let's say he did this. We could not put a price tag on what's not new to him. Do the USO show every Christmas which would build an audience for other conversations throughout here. Bob Hope presents the hilarious unri-hurst addicts who the stars starring Lucille Ball. Just  the USO shows, each special was almost . First came the 8-minute opening month, he fell 35 before he jams, then came the guest stars, a song, and a coin-skid segment at the end of the show. In 1986, I went to observe the legendary comedian tape one of these specials for NBC. At one point they did a spoof of muting on the bounty and a big wooden ship. The culprit kept him by, John Damper with spletcher crystal, Broadway musical star Howard. Kiel was the Valentine's High School Doctor. Morgan Brittney, who played Ham Youain's Evil Half Sister on Dallas, was a Chrissy British missionary. They can't remember what Jonathan Winner's played, but he was in draft. He was dressed as a Polynesian dancer, goreth, and a grass-bird, and coconut block. It looked  the easiest job in the world. No one even pretended to have memorized their lines. They just wouldn't read their dialogue from two kinds. They flumped a screen. Joe, the cameras just kept warm. That was how they achieved the famous style of a father's specials, or non-styled. We're supposed to be  watching famous people getting together for an hour and have a good time in front of the camera. In a TV business, these specials were famous because they always got top ratings and they didn't cost much to produce. Back in the 60's, father-in-hope, this end. amazing flaws inserted into his contract. Charges by NBC technicians will frozen at 1961 rates. Back when NBC struck that deal with him, it might have same  a good way to keep hope at the net one. The 25 years of power. If you wanted to have a set bill, the fee was circa 1961. He paid next to nothing to use the editing and post-production facilities, a manpower. Everything. That was the whole beauty of the set. You knew that. people to intend to adopt hope special to see Bob Ho. The costumes in Kauak were just linda dressing. Why paid people to rehearse? Why waste money? Call of the most economical, start-of-living system television ever seen. The sky was a change. Not long after I watched the film that sketch, I went to interview Bob Ho at a Stittie Room House on a quiet tree-line street in the Sanctuary of Outland. Okay, two dots, black lab and a white elcation. They called us up the drive clown. Do you want me to charge? You're okay, baby. And our baby, all of a sudden, there's a girl in her. That's okay. When one of them nipped at me, hope kept insisting. They were completely harmless. They were. Never been hit by any of these for a grab my arm. If you've ever done that, anybody, one of my writers? Well, all right. All right. Okay. Hey! I'm going to go for a ride. Things went downhill from there. Bob and Hope and I had no chemistry. No. He told jokes that I didn't get. And not only that, after he delivered the punch line, he'd lean towards me, fixing with his brown eyes, engaged my response, so I'd laugh. The things I said only made him fall into long, exasperated silence. It was awkward. So we ate much. Cream cheese. and please withdraw. I think I wanted him to show me how he changed with the times, how he sadly tweaked his material to better reflect his age, or adapted it so that it resonated with the popular culture. So I asked him a question. Are you pretty sympathetic to the woman's human? There I was, sitting with a man in his early 80s who are still telling how the hoverhubber jokes, and I'm quizzing him about the woman's movement, what was he expected? I am sympathetic. to anyone else. I do a joke. I close my... This touch big line. Right close, my neck. It's nice to be with you. And I tell you, women are really coming before in the school room. As it is wonderful. I'm so happy that we pushed them along. We kept them down,  I remember. Friend of mine said, it was , I'll forgive you, be so incredibly beautiful. So incredibly stupid. She's in the scarves where what he means, what he made me incredibly good, so you'd be attracted to me and made me incredibly stupid, so I'd be attracted to you Well, they die And I would say that's for the ladies that you got unless you could find it, that's a close my after them He was friends with so many friends, it was  being friends with Bob and her, so many good jobs We play golf with Eisenhower and Nixon, the word George Bush Sr. President Kennedy had him over to the White House to discuss jokes. L. B. J. presented him with a metal book read. Friends and supporties, key and Ronald Reagan had an annual tradition of celebrating New Year's at Walter Ann and Burrts and Palm Springs. Right around the time he met, he ran upon the standar was just being the great, and hope was struggling with how he is going to address the topic of the day that brings old prospects. At one point he does a ran contract with it But I wanted to back to say it's the hate of when I born policy is fun here Contest reduction they get mad when people screw things up and they don't have anything to do with it It's not either the White House a or do the curly Larry or no Okay, I understand so now I'm still open I was , Johnny Carson giving Joe's to Joe and Rivers. Well, that doesn't hurt. All right. And it's all front-pays. You have to go that way. That's the way I go. Hope has always been identified more with the right than the left. It was Republicans never Democrats who invited him to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom. But on that day, when I brought up politics, he classified himself as non-partisan. A leaner in the Lincoln bedroom. someone who lanes in the direction of an ever-is-compting town. Whether he was a leader or not, he's image as a fence traveler ended in 1963 with the Vietnam War. He was forced to make a political choice, in which ever-choice he made, it wasn't going to sit well with the other side. If he decided to go to Vietnam to entertain the troops, he was supporting an unpopular war. But if he decided to stay home, he risked breaking a tradition in this r... in the so far harmonious relationship with the government who helped make an American eye company. Will you never remember what we decided? From Shamiya Island in the illusions, from Yukota Japan, and from Camp AC, and Losal in Korea. In the end, hoped that nine Christmas tours in Vietnam and each of those shows he tapes, produced, and sold NBC as television who done and tampong in Thailand and from the National AirBagion Vietnam . It's Bob Boak, Christmas Festival. Sorry, right Bob? Roll up for love. For the first time you began generating criticism. Though there were still cheering crowds, there were plenty of times with a man booed Bob and gave him the finger.

In 1980 in Rolling Stone magazine, writer Timothy White quoted service man who claimed that attendance was mandatory that they were a captive audience, that the scantily-clad showgirls that had so delighted G.I.s in the past now just seen what P.G. rated strippers do.

And I'm the Barsport Winchester, and we just want to know if there's anybody out there who thinks they can handle too. Thank you very much. That call, it almost seemed  Bob broke with blind the politics of what he was doing. And out of touch, there's an incredible quote from Marlon Brando from an interview in Playboy Man's, Brando called hope and it paused. He said, Bob hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station and a high, provided they have a camera and three people there. The opening of a market and receiving a warrant. Brando said, it didn't bother him at all the work to be it now, more open to that. He did his World War II and Korean War Act, our boys and all that. He said, that it got. The criticism after Vietnam to be stunned for years he was seen as a good and fast agenda was lying around the world representing our country. He hadn't changed him. But somehow he became a vain to the anti-warme, a militarist. controversial didn't make sense. We were carrying bullets. We were carrying lands. And I went beyond anyone going. Everybody was the Vietnam. Jimmy Stewart in his wife. Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Chop, Heston, Johnny Grant. But on economy getting all the televisions happens. We don't do a net show. We all got the feeling. and this age, you're doing the show that's supposed to show some songs. And anybody that can deny those kids, the right to have a show  we've learned. Well, you've felt kind of sorry to those people as if they couldn't have been the very patriotic. I had a couple of people that took a piss off the Foley. and I gave the FBI share of it. They found these guys over in Santa Monica Boulevard. They chased them out. They came over and he. They were just bumps. They were, , probably guys that the defectors were signed. , kid walked up to me out there and then I was in my school. But after my college, he walked up the crime scene. Hey, is it true that YouTube comes to be a criminal? What was that? But he is. Oh, I recognize him. Is it really good to do something to have to fly out? No. You've got to see my show. We might have known that the politics of war are leading down this road adventure. No one can deny that in this career with the USL, Bob Hope faced hardship. and acted out of his sense of outwards and patriotism. But it's also clear that there was another sign here in all. He'd figure it out a way to this international conflict as a marbling tool for his reputation to be. There's nothing wrong with that. It just seems wrong quite now when people stop laughing. Thank you. Thank you.
