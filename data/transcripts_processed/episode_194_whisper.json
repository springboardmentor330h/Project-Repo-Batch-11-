  "text": "Sarah was here in 1994 in New York City a couple days ago. It was the place where families people who worked in the web trades and gave DNA samples to please use the Nigerian flying weapons. And she was standing in the parking lot. Then I saw this guy walking around basically in a circle looking at people and he kept touching his hand to the top of his head  he was rubbing the top of his head. And his movements are so strange that I actually thought that. Maybe he was deranged a little bit. Then the circles got a little bit smaller and he came closer to where I was. And then I just realized that he had a flyer pinned to his t-shirt. And the flyer had a picture of the sky's black and white pictures. And some writing on it, I realized he was somebody's relative. He didn't want me on a loving New York City, plus the misfire of the 40-block area. That picture. He's got to the army, he's put out a missing person support. He tried to reach other people and his father's office, and 90-third wood, which he got in every hospital, and he just gave them some DNA. So I said, what are you going to, what do you do now? And he said, he said, I don't know. And he said it , not just  I don't know. But he's , I don't know where to go. I just, he just had no idea where to go. But what to do? And he couldn't go home. It was , I think there's this sense of  as long as there's daylight, you should be tracing around the city looking, whoever. And it was still, it was sort of early afternoon. And he just, I could just tell he just had no idea what to do physically with himself. He said, I was walking around over there and I realized I was literally walking around the circles. I don't have to do. But so strange is that it wasn't just people touch surgery by tragedy. Do  what we've all been in a little bit of a fog? It's hard to sleep. It's hard to know what to think of things we want to help somehow but beyond a few simple things that is not clear what to do or how to do it. Walking in circles in such a primal response, a friend who was in Washington Square Park in New York during the web trades in the business, said that a man that he was standing walking in circles in the screen. And maybe it's just me but before last week I could have never imagined that we owned that we needed to somebody doing that. But now I can't. In Chicago where I live, when I'm in the car driving around I find myself obsessed with staring hand cops in the serious tower. Two buildings that are about as large as the little trade scene buildings. And I look at them and try to get my mind around the scale about what it means. and things are crazy, did become crumbling to the ground, for two somethings that will. So many tell me the first week that this happened, she suffered the radio horn, because she didn't want to miss the chance that somebody would explain why this happened. And then you tell this, didn't matter how much we have all learned in the last two weeks about a song, the modern, and the fantasy, and the huge military bases that have been in Saudi Arabia since the Persian Gulf War, this is the people who had a God's War and do, . who knew you  who knew. No matter how many of these facts that we learn about why people and other countries hate us, facts, and facts, and facts somehow in your gut. The only way of this thing that it still just doesn't add up, it still does not make sense to you. So, here in Real Keep Chang, it's probably the easiest part to go and propagate in the international. It's the same thing  America last. Today on our program, stories about the news of the last two weeks, about what to make. things now that we're gone from what the world was before, what it is today. We have stories from David Cineras, we're gonna walk off from here to more coming and from others to stay here for this. Back one. Then after a couple of minutes, when Simpson is 50, and welcome to the Indian for a one-year-old or a smart company called Strategic Communications, we're really happy. is a pity and the market in the communications with the music friends. And others she knows people who died in the packaging of the 20-second quote from the volume of the app. She is capable of being that meat-to-spare and as the first power-class series we could be in the street, which she knows, and glass and gray and the huge cloud and dust and ash. She spoke to me from her apartment in Queens. I wanted to talk to her about what she's doing now and especially what she needs to what happened to me. But we began by beginning. How does it seem to me to say? Well, they were five of us in the office. We were the early bird. And all of the stuff, it was an enormous crash. And the building actually did a trip with Kila Shake. The lights went out. The green-pierced camels, the ceiling came down. The clouds had to sell everything, started popping. And smoke immediately filled the entire off. And on the floor where you were, how many floors were you? I believe the airplane hits either just above or just above the 8990s, 91st floor. The only reason that I'm here partly because the airplane hit on the southern side of building. My office had a view uptown of the Empire State Building, Husk River, the light-grouted, smoking, dams, it was getting very hot. I did try the emergency farewell, and that door was locked. and we drank water, we covered our noses. I called, so my boss, my boyfriend and my mother. What did you say? I said to all of them, I'm all right. You don't know what's happened, but I'm all right. And my mother, John, who know me that could hear that I was shaking, and I was shaking. And I told, And I said the doors are locked. I can't get out. You can't stand the stairway. A few minutes after that, people knocked on the door and there were people men with flashlight, knocking on the door and saying, come out and let's go down there. And the doors were open at that point. The stairwell that you had to be there while you were there. But I had tried to go on here. But then we started down and about the 83rd floor, we had to cross over. And we crossed over that floor was devastated. It was pitch black, couple of folks, sprinklers were coming down, feeling had come down, had old hands, walked across it, and the only light you guys who had was one man's cell phone, and we made our way across that to another stairwell, and then we proceeded down, I believe, to 78. So 78 had crossed two, the other set of stairs. And when we crossed from 78, it was as if nothing happened. the life-grown, no smoke, air-pushing, parking, all-perfect. How strange that must have been so strange. We're very curious. There's a scope for one of these together. But at 78, we had to make a decision. There were two exit times. And one exit blurr that one exit went down one floor and then thought it just said, to the other exit, which suddenly said, trust, I know we have to go down this staircase. And we did trust that person. went down in staircase and that led us to bottom. So, and then we continued down. We had to move over to the fireman's full gear, we're coming up. And they started, they met us in about 50. They started coming up. And when we got to the positive level, the positive level is the level between the two tower. And they're found out there, and they are still concerned. They told us, do not look up, do not look out, do not look down, just keep going. Oh shit. need you to hurry, run, put you jaw. I'm sure that in less we can have you, you must start a lot of that. What do you think about that? How are you putting that together? A lot of it has to, I think, timing, lock. There's a small part of me that feels that you've taken. something else world that I'm supposed to. I don't know. Part of me does steal that. That's it. But part of you, because that is just changed. Part of you feel the chance, I do know that my outlook on life changed. I know that for me I'm going to not put off things that I want to do. One of the things that is more towards background. Seven. And so I also with the Pennsylvania I told the next door neighbor is the... courses to see is go out to find the course. And I also send, when I spend more time with my family, this was Fred. They all sat with the minister, called minister, and they all sat with mothers living room, and they said they watched each die as one world president or went down, because they had heard her. That non-clothed course. And they said they speak reeks for about half an hour until John Paul's. had heard from Linda Chief alive. So for half an hour, they got me wrong. Yes, it shunned all the thought I was gone because he watched these powers come down. And he had nobody had heard because he was impossible. Where did you finally come from? I called him, I was walking across the Weaver Bridge and there were two guys walking in my lap, and everybody had a look. because everybody walks with people of normal. They obviously did a back move in their buildings where they were sitting. I smelled a normal. I was dust covered, still seated, and staring straight ahead. And they asked me to heard my story. And he had a cell phone, and said, I actually used a cell phone. He said, yes, I'm having trouble getting through, but you may use it, quite punched in the number. Hold on. I did it twice. He kept it. He died, he died, for about five minutes, after talking. As we walk, and all of a sudden, Scott said, it's ringing in the head and it's all. And I got on the phone and I said, hi John, I'm walking across a bridge. And John's just green and always it's fell on the floor. I'm going to guide you alive. And I said, I'm lying, walking across the bridge. Please call me mother. Anybody who's been watching TV has seen the images and the towers being hit and collapsing over and over and over. So you must have been seeing that as well. Yeah, I thought I did decide to watch and I did decide to watch it on Wednesday. Today I did not watch it on Tuesday night. And when you first saw what it was and what it was and what it was and what it was. And what did you think? I was powerful. At the first plane that went in, I counted the floor and I... I know that it went in very near my quote, but on my quote, it impacts floor. Does it seem more horrible watching the pictures of a decimation outside than it seemed when you were in the sun? Yeah, it seems much more horrible to have some. You've inside, I don't have those images. I have my own images, both flames, duh. But I don't have the image of the flame and all the light I cannot. watch the TV, that's really great my heart and it's yours well up. Baby, because you feel  you're back in the beginning. Could have been my, the fact that John was really here, you're, and my family's really just a fan of the minister, and they were mourning me because they thought I'd dead. In I, to that I, to the, of all, in their individual place just mourning me. And, and... My brother packed a black suit black tie in a white shirt and drove my mother's jersey when he heard Because he felt that who's going to be going to a funeral or memorial? Are you sleeping okay? Not really. No. I do wake up a lot. Here's a... I... I don't know if I can put images out of my mind and go back to sleep. But it's hard. First several lines. I'll wake up. little of the night and just have those images of the towers in my mind, the folk. And also that was when I could smell out of the chair. The very accurate stuff, now. Yeah. And I just had to get rid of that smell. And it's a smell that I will never forget. And it's a smell that's on my clothes. I have clothes that I was wearing today. Choose my socks, my socks, my socks, my socks, my socks, even a little, I wear a little thing in my hair. I don't know what to do with this. You still have? I can't. I don't want to throw them away. I don't want to have them clean. Why don't you even throw them away, haven't you? I don't know. I don't know. I can't quite remember. It is a bunch of trash. But it happens to me and I'm caught. I'm caught. I just know that I have them in bag and I keep the bag in the report. I will eventually do something with them because that part is not good, but right now I just can't do that. when you talk about the websites and you do it in present instances, it's still there. You talk about there is a fountain. Yes, yes, I know. Do you feel  you fully accept that it really happened? Films are in full. except because I've crossed George Washington's bridge and seen that they're not there. That's the reality. But no, it's almost. It is not. It's surreal, not. Part is as hard as it is not there. Part believe I'm not going to go to work. They haven't gone to work in. We can go. Yeah. No. So we have no place to go at all. The company is going to find startup and her are we to space. She looses for everything. There, to nap, one off. Oh, your records, all your buildings, everything. Absolutely everything. People owe you money. Yes. But you have no idea who they are. That's right. Or how much they owe. That's right. That's true. And we owe people my kids. And then how does that work? Is it some sort of insurance paying for your children? Well, you think. It is, they did receive an insurance payment. You're fine. Bye-bye. And so they are paying people, first thing they did was pay salaries and sex they did to everybody to go out and buy a tutor, printer, and they're going to get everybody to sell phone. Companies are very anxious, they get back to work. And if I could have bought a tutor today, I would have gone out to buy one. But unfortunately, you are carried. Very difficult, not a pop artist, tutor. You're having to have the ones who've been bought by this business sister, you start. and bought up every laptop every desktop. What are you thinking you're going to want to get back to work? Well, I don't know. Probably next week for the week after. When you get up in the morning you think, oh wait, it's got to go some more, but you don't need to go. I'm a little startled sometimes when I wake up the morning because I don't set the alarm clock. Do you find a plug? Oh yeah, and the flags are very hard work. Just make me happy next week. I was wondering, when you say, if I do, you feel  it's the rest of us saying to you, , you've been making that another kind of Russian Christian various ways that we're with you, our hearts are with you. Yeah, and we're together. And you're actually feeling it that way, but it's a message from us to everyone who, to you, who, who just got out and all the way to the music, and you're also in touch. Yeah, I do. And it's so many lives, but good feeling. It makes me feel as if. We're putting aside heavy differences and heavy things that we all deal with on the day today based on annoyed about. And are you 90 and across political parties, which is barriers to crossing everything. So that everybody working with. Do you want revenge? No. I think that we America. I think that we need to text ourselves in our short form of people for your retaliation. Is there a part of you which feels  , don't do this for me? I was in that building, don't do it for me. I feel  if we just know a personal attack on me, just text America. Yeah, well said. So it's not personal. I was innocent by sister. She was  six. And what I'm saying should not go and tell me again, other innocent. Cannot be indiscriminate, bomb, bomb, bomb, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia or any of those other, Cannot be that, that's not great. That should not be wrong. Yeah. Let's listen. Let's listen. Don't know. Yeah? Yeah. Don't. Thesee the and the business day and the money, and the business day and the money. Near the north end of Tamponsburg parking east village, the memorial fountain is still stairs. Directed by the Sympathesis Society of German ladies, it commemorates the fire aboard the... the Steinship, the Journal of Slocum, in 1904. The Conforigation claimed the lives of 1331 people. Most of the women in children from what was then, the German immigrant armed brave managed to climb Deutsche. As I near the problem, Colesifier the worst disaster in history of New York. In the most painful and horrifying example of this great city's capacity to pop itself all previous expectations, deciding now have been changed. It was on June 15, 1904, by all accounts of perfect day. That's some 1,300 members of St. Moxie Benjellik, the loser in church board of the genesis of the 3rd Street team for their annual sum of the week. At 9.40 a.m. the steamer named for the silver board of handijers, local began on its way, passing under the Brooklyn Bridge in the 21 years of the time, and headed north of then south of hard road. in the days after the disaster, a minute by minute a town to what happened in the scene was piste together. At 9.57 a boy noticed smoke so he could remember to move the door for lower forward cabin. Among the preparations made for today had been three battles filled with drinking glass is packed in hang at the stove. A discarded merchant started to smolder it. At 10am and inexperienced kept shotgun open the door. the three years, which spread through the lower hallways and lounges, triggering the panic disdain in the terrified passengers. Another boy ran to tell the captain where he ran shape. Get the hell out of him, mind your own business, he replied, thinking of a prank. He didn't realize it was true until six minutes later when he looked at his cabinets or the flames in the burning passengers. By this time it was too late. The spanking C-wordiness of this welcome new lake進 to the castle repenting. The Holt was littered with debris, the crew was me and large near and tiny, and had never practiced a single fire. The fire house, deployed far too late, was useless anywhere, the linen having rotted through and splitting long its length beneath. The lifeboat had been painted fast to the rails of the boat, and what life jackets that could be pulled free from the overhead mesh were over 13 years old. Some tore open  the hose, shattering the headset. people with the problems of their disintegrated court fillings. Other life jackets held together, but they proved lethal. A woman dropped her daughter from the side wearing one bone to watch her sink  a stone. All was pandemonium. From the shores of the Bronx and across the river and Queens, people watched, horrified what was happening just 200 yards away. Some is ramen to try and save the scores of people who jump from the vessel, some of fire, some court of new ships happened to ease. The general slope and fully exploded into flames of 10 or 6, eventually coming to rest, the burning hulk and Lord Brother's eye lead, the 10 to me. It took less than a quarter from Hally. Among the 1,000 31 dead, not one crewman, nor the country. There were hundreds of humans that we can find virtually, with miles along the sessions leading the horses across the river to the new theme-scentering trees. The captain, William van Scherke, was convicted of negligence and manslaughter in sentenced to 10 years in C.C. He was hurled as his reign of half and pardoned by William Howard Taft in Christmas Day 1911. The boat itself was unbelieated by, salvaged and converted to a cargo march, which finally sank in the storm here at Landtick City that senior. A captain, the horror June 15 itself, are many. There is also a well-peased man. of transcript of the Inquirystein trial. By contrast, there are almost no details of the emotion of you. Because it's that I could find is a posting on the General's local website from a woman named Jacqueline Duffy who writes, My father's family had done his fifth state, and according to him, there was not a tenement on that street that did happen at least one great thing to do online. If the need to speak of calamity is human nature, we are also are predisposed to suffering our lasting sorrows in the silence. There is one one posting on website about families that never spoke of the day again. How does one articulate beyond growing sadness and asking? An anguish is so great that the only recourse for people who is to live forever the building in streets that now only help memories of death. The articles in one of the general's so-called almost all in the same way. The kind we're trying. never seen things. That's the term used, never deceived. The German community operated itself, resetting on the upper east side and in Queens, some men simply moved back to Germany. What seems to have scattered the survivors was to despair, not a cruise. The dead were for the most part not their keys. They were women, grand man, they showed it. As of the victims were under 20 years old. Today there are bedroom communities on Long Island in New Jersey, Manhattan, Montclair, Ridgewood, Summit, that are missing hundreds of parents, neighbors, and parents. An entire ladder company surprised nations have gone. Right now, we New Yorkers are being told that our spirits are not broken, that we will rebuild, and we will do it quickly. We would do well to remember in this time of stalwart rhetoric that for some people rebuilding will be haunted. It's not for us to say. If there is a difference in the immediacy of the experience right now between New York City and the rest of the country, there is a formal profound separation in the city itself. Between the people directly affected by the terror and those not. I can count myself lucky to be among the latter, essentially untouched, and never more superfluous in my adoptive city than right now. Beyond donating blood or money, I am of the Baptist much. shoes as about to chocolate. The memorial fountain is a nine foot tall slab of pink tennis in marble, now fight white with edge. In relief are the heads of two children, round cheek and jellic improv out, a blossoming round frame. They were earth's purest children, young and fair, it says a movie. About 3 feet off the ground, a marble lion's head shoots four to three and a three-foot water. If one didn't walk around to the side through the memorial inscription, which I stated with the years, one might easily mistake this fountain for me and this blue nice to do. It's image of the children in the words about them, nothing more than the turn of the century, to the innocence of childhood, perfectly suited to a park where her and was my take is probably. There are countless makeshift soldiers to choose their daily life all over the city. Clusters of Rotor candles, flowers, and a heartbreaking staggering number of flyers with photographs in names of the missing. Tom Pink's book is no exception, but curiously there is nothing we're in the country. No one seems to remember that their placematary dissonance. A block away is St. Mark's Lutheran, the Church of the Slocum's Victims. It is now an Orthodox synagogue, and it is the first day of the Jewish New Year when is going to be run for us together. A boy from half eight runs down the steps and gives a hopper. His father comes out after him calls, wait up. He says it  a school yard of how. The boy stops and his father catches up with him and they continue to block. If you didn't know, it would seem  a perfect thing. But of course you do know. You cannot imagine a baby in the woman. Perhaps they only turn fit to be taken in all of this. And they'll be. is it such a day, welcome? Such a day, is it? Maybe that coffee is not, this is not a coffee. Not you hear from this day Will I be alone? I still feel I swear It's still safe The things that they say you're mad now three notes from the underground That I should have for events that might somehow illuminate what we see in New York this week The step of the radio show He may be possible by the Japanese fiction writer, who is more common Even at an interview to survivors of terrorist attacks It has to be taken So, during rational, six years of now. March 20, 1995, we radically do use the point of view. Sorry, talking view. Throughout plastic bags, closing gas and people's subline, tend to guess that you can spot sun, you can put 26 times just put in the sun, you can ask. For 5,000 people in the world, nine. For a coming interview, dozens of survivors have been working on the English edition of the School of London, and the English-speaking English-speaking English-speaking English. When the gave us permission to be pushed into the room, we hear a number of new voices because of any other thing. I left the house as usual just after 7. It has left it habit. The bus was about 2 minutes early. It was always late, once it was ahead of schedule. I ran for the stop and didn't make it in time so I had to catch the next bus at 7.30 instead. You can back. It all started because the bus was 2 minutes early. I looked up to see this man sitting directly to my lap, pouring another coat. I was still wrapped up in my book. But really began to get on my nerves. Another coat's often smellful and you don't think? I've disinfected in my nail polish and me with kind of smell. This guy stinks  foam. And I stared him right in the eye. When he doesn't seem to be looking at me, he just stared back at me with this. You got a problem, Mr. Kind of look. He's looking past me to something on my right. In turn, the rounds of look and saw something about the size of a notebook lying on the teeth of the second person on my right. It's  a plastic pack. In the news, they said it was wrapped in newspaper. But I saw it was plastic and something is spilling on it. That's when I got a sharp smell of it. I said, poke a rock at home. I used to stuff the way I contained the glass in my coffee. And they were very well. I always carried it on the job. It was somehow a therapy suite. Now I'm passing the door. If it is smell really warm, everyone would have been in the room. I found a strange tickling room for, , in the dentist's ear and the stomach and seeping back in the ear throat, just  that. So that's what's making the place smell and thought. But I still just sat in. Soon everyone was saying, open the windows and stings. So they all open the windows. I remember thinking, it's so cool. I had you just put up with the smell. I stood at the front next to the driver's compartment, holding the handrail by the door. Then when I took a deep breath and got this sudden pain, really it was  I had been shot or something. I was suddenly breathing completely stopped. , if I inhale of any more, all of my guts would be spinning right after my mouth. everything became a vacuum. It seems kind of odd, but I thought, just maybe my grand-dad started. He lived up north in his 94 years old at the time. I'd already been taken else so maybe this was a kind of sign. That was my first stop. Maybe he died or something. Then suddenly I heard a woman scream, a loud piercing squawk on her pair, at least in the it seems. outside the car, what now? The platform is so crowded and could this thing be inside the tree. Subway, my eyesight was hungry, so I was seeing fireworks. And then the times I could later my eyes black out. It was a bright clear day, I know where this curtain descended and I can see the tree. The train went above ground for a while some reason this time, the star is revealed. black and white or sequia just  an old photograph. That's all. And thought, today was a supposed to be sunny. My legs started to feel shaking. My eyes stopped working. Suddenly this is a magnet. I should have stayed back there with the others. I moved from strapped until I reached the hole in the door. Finally I stepped off the train. My hand out ready to catch myself with the far wall with the platform. I remember thinking, if I don't make it to the wall and crouch down, we're gonna fall and hit my head. Then I'd link down. Actually, I hadn't left the train. I grabbed the stainless steel pole and just slid down to the floor. When I thought it was a wall, it was in fact the floor of the car, which felt chilly to my right hand. We ran a photo of me in Tabloons, so I could see later what happened. happen. I couldn't see. I couldn't run. I couldn't have been far and I couldn't see something  that. I couldn't die  that. It'll be pathetic to try this. Why are you six and you're going to see me when I remember thinking, say back then, I'm going to go flying and dying, please. Just chase your Breath because I capture the whole choices. I've found the officers to tell them. I have to be hospitalized for a long time in the days. I'm sure I'm going to trouble you, but could you tidy up my desk? I'd been right at the end of the set of shattering at the death toll of my apartment. I was watching a program on TV. Is it a were someone else's problem? Much later that I began to wander hard could have been so cap- I took him curious very good, explode into the autumn of the sinking, with a little bit of a little bit. I just got him back from the 10-day business trip to South American, the strange in the world. While I was in the South American, I was invited out to karaoke, someone from Japanese Embassy in Columbia. Then I almost worked back the next day, the same place. They said, no, it's Charsam Wrenu. And that very day the place got bombed. I remember thinking when I got home, the least of parents I see was the next day I go to work on the gas at their cameras. I've heard that probably when I was a little funny in my head, I want to round telling people something's out there. You see, something strange is going to happen. I was buying a survival gear at camping stores. After my team back to London, I think, what a fool I think. But at time, I was literally serious. What I'm going to do when I'm so mad in my head. Right after the attack. I was seeing with anger, I was pacing in hospital quarters, probably when the columns were long. At that point I stood with the note was on, but the word was, I was waiting to beat them up. I didn't even notice the several days later my fist was sore. I asked my wife, there's my hand hurts so much, and she said, you've been punching me for this course I was furious, but to tell the truth strong event any angry Now is the feeling that just don't want to remember anymore. Between the time I was hospitalized and the time I was sent home, I wanted to know everything that happened. I was devouring and using it to be, but now I can't stay to be. I changed the change. I don't ever want to see another image of the density. I should not hate being asked most of all is, do you have any after this? I just can't bear anyone asking you that. Although my dislike would be asked, the R after effects might itself be a kind of after-eat. I just  to know what the criminal thought they were doing. I demand a full explanation and apology I absolutely insist on. I might easily doubt him. I do think about that. I'm still nervous. going out alone, it's not even what it takes some way to just to go out walking, it's here as we now. I live alone now, but at the time I have seen why from kids, sorry, I'm not sure what it takes. To be honest, the day after the gas attack, I asked one for the worse. We were bone tasty perms up. and I'm done with my fair share of thinking. Still, even after all I've been through, she would barely speak me. After being cast, I phone home from the office to tell my wife and it happened when my symptoms and everything, but I got almost no reaction from her. Perhaps she couldn't really grasp the situation, exactly what had occurred. But even so whole, I know then that we'd come to a turning point. The state I was in had gotten me all worked up, maybe that's what it was. Maybe that's why I came straight out of them and said, I wanted to divorce. Perhaps if this serenade hadn't happened, I wouldn't have been talking about divorce so shew. I probably wouldn't have said anything. It was a shock to the system, and at the same time, it kind of triggered. When a family had been in such a mess for so long, then by then I didn't consider myself very important. After the possibility of dying, it wasn't real. I thought I'd probably be a good of accepted it in my own way, it's just a kind of matter. For a while after the gas attack I got  slowly over the other three away. I'm genuinely good on the new thing. I still haven't had plastic piece in case the malnutriest care. , and one of you are這樣子. of his mouth and it was  nothing's worthwhile anymore. I even felt my giving away my most precious ones I. I had terrible nightmares. The one I remember best is a doing image someone pulled me out of my bed and I stood a window and dragged me around the world. I returned and suddenly saw someone standing and was supposed to be dead. Then I'm not in my dead people in my dreams. Afterward, I was in scaredy tram along the subway. No bad 3G, maybe I'm just no wooden 6-skin. I'm not in fear of this fate. Usually I don't go through the first door and hear us in front. I always use the second which will put me down wind in the sun. That day in that day, I'm just the first door for no special. integration growth change.

I've been concerned with my accent and sometimes went so far as to touch my hand. I just here know less shocking, meaningful, haunting bear heart. Businessmen in widows from the embassy offering their beds to Americans stuck at the airport and at noon on the official day of morning, the desk re-installed in their pants and cars pulled off the road to observe the frequency of silence. I started up. I started leaving flowers in little part across the street in American members. It was genuinely to the TV games as well, at which point it became self conscious. It planes moving, the towers collapse, and people react with heartfelt shock and war. You cry because you're sad and fight, and then before  it, the images are repeated and slow motion, you say no barber scene, and a close-up photograph of the same study Then you cry because somebody's making, and you wind up feeling confused in a minute. that you won't be in this one quite good and you'll need a professional help. Two days after the attack, my friend Chris and her tender service, the American Church, unlike the service held the previous afternoon of the American Cathedral, this was immediate and attended by the mayor of Paris, the Prime Minister and President Shalak. The Church was small and happy to use a reporting doc for members of Parliament, and you can give me that one. This way. in the rain and heavy-squeering. The line for the rest of us stretched around the corner of town to sleep, and crevier America moved into a journey to the camera from microphone to asking to the south. The instinct was to say that, oh, aside from the slight sore throat, you thought to be gone. Good course, you could. The service was broadcast on television, so although it was an American church, the salmon was delivered in crange. The short speech is given. ministry, rabbi, and the mosque in Iraq. It was all very tasteful that failed the satisfied the 200 or so Americans. We'd come with a sudden desire to be with their people. It's different in visiting tourists. The Americans who actually live here go to great lengths and avoid one another. Now we wanted to hang out in Shinoff Hemphids, but it wasn't in the program. The service ended and just as a last politician filed out of the room. Man, the balconies. It's a song I'd always associated with home room in high school sport events, but under the circumstances, and non-foreign soil, the lyrics became significant.

Then there's that strange bit about the oceans light with foam, which is odd and it's not in any way a national phenomenon. Lots of countries have come. They just don't talk about it. What killed me, what killed us all, was a very end. My home sweet home. Because regardless of what we tell ourselves, Paris is not our home. It's just the place where we have our apartments, our kitchen. If it were our home, we'd have wanted to stay put, rather than catching next flight back in New York, or Kansas, or wherever our families sat, helped something we tell them. I worry here that we mention this moment, I only. serve to destroy, to package what it felt genuine and pure. Today's past might be no longer separate what I'm feeling in what I'm watching people feel on TV. You must supposed to call in now, you must supposed to feel proud, feel pity.

The BBC is offered exhaustive coverage, but in the absence of breaking news they too have brought up in teddy bears. I heard that the survivors in New Townsend. I heard that the rest you've worked with in New Townsend. I heard that even the people who voted we watched it on TV should consider talking to a compassion.

And then in the days of fall, as a president, another figure started to say that there was not a war but actually when that particular plan was details of what that war would be, waiting a flag started to feel  you were getting a red-wet and blue blank chat to them to do whatever they wanted. I think I think I got it. people speaking to myself anyway I want to hear up my hand first before I cheered it on it made me uneasy on my hands because I think there's a deeply American idea of  all this being together and getting hostile done and then there's an idea which is exactly the opposite and just as the as a tradition which is to be completely skeptical of government and the citizens at all time and  a lot of other patriotic people I felt formed between me now of course we have president's priorities I mean But the flag still means different things to the people.

And so the bridge view mosques. Yeah, so it takes on a whole different ad who's shouting the USA USA by virtue of where they are and who their surroundings are. Are there flags? Flags are everywhere. They're waving their flags out the window. They're draped over the back of the cars. They're standing in the streets of these huge flags. Mostly all these people are youth, young men. And so these groups of Arab Americans start chanting that. USA USA. saying yeah you said you said three side is chanting you said so at some point it was it was as if it were the sharks in the jets with something and each side on one side of the street the Arab Americans on one side of the street the angle Americans on the other side all waiting flags all screaming at the top of their lungs you let say you said you said some people are fitting it at any and some people are  and some and then there's people driving by in the middle of the street with the flags and the horns and and they're all shouting the same thing they're all shouting the same thing but they need something completely different when each of them shouts USA, USA. The meaning completely different things. The white guys when they're shouting USA, they're basically saying, this is my country, and we want you out of here, you get out. We're sick of the Arabians being here and wanting a lot of our country. Simply put the screw in everything up to take it all on one end.

You should not be happy. what was really interesting? What's the young man who said, , this is our country and we want them out of here. Moments after he says this to you. he's starting to continue shouting USA and he's waving a flag and then someone hands him a really big flag. It's a flag that takes two people to hold. So he's holding one hand and another guy is holding the other hand. But in the Prosh of Proud, somehow the other end of the flag gets transferred to another young man and the other person who's an Arab American.
