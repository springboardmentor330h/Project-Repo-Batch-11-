  "text": "But had to endure up on a dairy farm in Hampshire, worked five times, speaking up about six, seven years old. And his father retired, right, ran his own operation, when his dad's caught him. And did you spy? But in the 1980s, it's something strange very to happen with the cows. The series of street things that didn't happen actually. Getting the good. That was the first thing. Cow's feet don't normally have a tree, a tree in the old one, once a year. Parsley tries and hopes that we could be three and four pets in here. Let me just trim their herbs. Right. If they got sort of feet, they don't walk around by tissue. They won't go and eat by tissue. Did they give us much milk? No, not the production was low, all the time. I helped the cow, we give right 75 to 90 pounds to milk today. These cows were averaging 40 at best. It's hard to even cover it expensive. Cows developed other problems. They had trouble conceiving. They started losing weight. They began to get sick. Oh, I'd have a vet near the vet near the end of every six weeks or something. Is that pretty expensive? It's very expensive. You could spend $100 per cow pretty quick. And I'll let get out of them as they didn't know what was metal. They tried medicines, they changed the cows feed, they changed it again. They replaced the cows with new cows. And this one on month after month, dear. year for a decade and a half. And Ron was not an office. He was an experienced dairy farmer. He didn't do a lot. The early 50 years old when the trouble began. He tried this, he tried that. All the time watching himself slowly go broke. Well, just nobody had any answers. Makes suggestions and we tried to do it or suggested to us. Nothing seemed to work for us. It just must have made you piss off. I need to say well I mind the London South as much as anything. I'm trying to accept the fact that I wasn't doing something right as I say no matter what I did, it didn't work. First time I talked about a few months back, some of them I'm close to was having also its medical problems, and go through tests and CAT scans and spymal tabs and more CAT scans. And the doctors couldn't figure out what was causing the problems. And in the absence of information, she did what Rod did. She bling her cell. And I think this happens a lot. I think that when you have nothing to go on, you feel the vacuum with anything that you have in hand. With any superstitions that you think... up with everything that you think you could have done wrong. But, of course, something has a name. It could be in, . And that period, before  the truth, that period is often worse than the truth that you find out. Today in our program, we bring you stories about that eerie unsettling period, before something has a name. And stories about how things change, once things do happen. In our case, it turned out that high voltage power lines across this property. We're leaking current into the ground. When it was wet outside, moisture would carry the electricity, not much electricity, just 30-by-watcher cell, enough for  vibration sort of thing. Through the ground and into the barn and up into the cows drinking frost. The cow was standing there with BSE and it went spot. And the girl had drinks a lot of them, and because electricity was getting over the water, they'd get a shark as they would drink. And what would that do? Well, instead of putting the head down into the water, Brinkens say it's just lapin' at it, a dog,  a small person. We just would take in the arch. They were afraid they would run into the shop and go great. The Casridine Hydrator, getting only about a third of the water they were supposed to get, and that explained all of the rather problems. After nearly 15 years of uncertainty, it was a relief finally know the answer. Right Hudson was so heavily in debt, there was no way to repute fast enough, and he lost the phone. 65, , I was a new job.

Striding around where? Get generalers bounce or downings. So even earlier than you'd have to get up to look out. I'll just about sit in the real. It's just about time for a normal girl. And so what do you think that's all? I'm long. You do. I will do. Welcome to BB-Easy Chicago, this is American Light, distributed by Public Radio International, my request. Today on our program, before it had a name, our program in 4X today. day, at one, Mr. Boder vanishes, in that act of the very first recording of polycost survivors made just after the war before the Holocaust was even called the Holocaust. And very different mother-holic cost survivors interviews because of that. For gotten for decades, never before broadcast, those tapes here today on our program and the story of the man who collected them. Back to, of course, I remember the name. In that act, the difference between those we know and those who's names. We know that degree, I'm at day for plates. Story of four kids, in fact, the mother was just knee. And then they found that there was a different name for a complete rewriting everything they ever knew about. That four, we call that love. Let's stay with us. At one, Mr. Boder vanishes. This is story of a manning. David Boder, who started to investigate the Holocaust before it was known as the Holocaust. And because of that, his research was different and treated differently by the world. The investigations done later. Carm R. Zale, Justice Gohan In 1946, David Boder went to Europe to interview survivors of Nazi concentration camps, specifically to record their stories in their own voices. The time this was in the idea, so new he was the only one who left. What he got with first. or all history of Holocaust survivors before it was even called the Holocaust. Even if you heard other survivor accounts, there's something different about these interviews. Over and over, people refer to names that have since taken on a bigger student, but without knowing bigger support. George Caldore, a survivor from Hungary, tells border that when the first survivor of the camp, block past the gate with the words, works sets man free, and that matters as chief physician who's named border didn't recognize. and misspelled in the transcript as wangley. The border type question marks next to the moon. When a French woman named Nellie Bundy mentioned the camps she was sent to. It's not enough for her to say the reason she's broken out and outshorts for border to know what she's talking about. She calls border type. She calls border type. She calls border type. She calls border type. She calls border type. that the march from Auschwitz to Birknow and on the way the guards shot the scragglers. A familiar scene to many of the scene of movie I ran out of book of the Holocaust. But surprising the news going. Hey, you should have been  a cat. Oh no, she's saying she fell down somewhere and he just shot her. That was odd. That was the strings, so. You see? Maybe it's a kind of dramatic irony. The ratio of our own awareness to this speaking is likely. Maybe it's the way people talk when they barely know what's happened to them. Before analysis, each actually should have put everything in this place. People in the camps have been cut off from our nostalgia in the past few years. all you can talk about is what happens to them. They have no bigger picture. When Nalvanday tries to get refuge within the Osarma after the journey surrender, she goes to a checkpoint and pops to an American guard. Nalvanday is a few more minutes, and she has to go in the city of Osarma. When the guard asks, yes, she has to say the hall of Osarma. The idiot doesn't exist, her or the guard. So instead she makes up a turn for herself. So instead she makes up a turn for herself. I'm a French political prisoner, Jesus. I'm a French political prisoner. The guard outside the dozen having inspections reported from prison and in those two ask his captain. The captain is in there, and the captain is in there, and the captain is in there. Captain comes back and tells her, how much fear is soaring, let's supire having gotten instructions from political prisoners. Just for prisoners who are bored, and turns them away. The captain is in there, and he's in there. Often in recordings you get the sense of two world news in first time and trying to figure each other out. The survivors and the people they come across just don't speak the same language. This is very different from later interviews with survivors after a common language at the ballot. So we have to go on the so-called death mount. You have theCause this is 3- ficou gun. These are interviews of survivors late after 1988 in releasing the box set called Voices on the shore. This one described the same experience in our bandit. Now it has a meaning to death much. We had to watch the nicest that is all that she gave me her shoes. It was January 1945 and was so slick and called no food, nothing that makes the sweat you couldn't get. There was no way that they answered up. At the beginning, they shot through the eye on the star. But after the white, white was the bullet. Let them see the student. That's  they called the dead nurse. Send them but I can't... ...make them easier. Grund staff is in trouble. Y'know... Set your rules. HELLO! What are recorded by 19 news for two months? You cut it on likely figure, an older man in both moon glasses, wearing blazing tie in the middle of summer, burdened by six times of primitive recording equipment in the bad part. Because we did this work before the Holocaust and the name, menacing a casual name, recognition, talk, and comment language, get trouble getting funded, and what was never true but completely, it takes the last five decades. three www.trnuksp, лушай, wait a minute, wait a minute.

He founded somebody'sette. Start clapping through. it. And on page 18 found an article by David T. Boulder, a psychology professor at IIT. The boarder's article was about his recent expedition to Europe, and it struck me as odd for a couple of reasons. I'd never heard of boarder, even though it's in turns out he was the first person who worked to record Holocaust victims. And the poems odd, his writing is clear and formative and totally devoid personal content. It seems strange that a Jewish man, and I'm face to face, we did. the attempted extinction of the spupon. The paddles article displays people of Europe eliminating else on the psychological and anthropological study. And so I find out what it could about being found. In 1930s and 40s, there was a minor problem for you. Can a professor who knew how to get to see you? The short-up in time magazine is some invention called the adjective verb motion. We made the paper with his analysis of children's lives at Santa Claus, we were the experiment where he wired his students in the sense in charted their reactions to scary news. But at some point in the mid-40s, his research shifted focus and took on a urgent talk. By an acting 45 who was trying to get a visa for Europe, empirically writing grant proposals to fund a project. They were news-reel on newspaper accounts of what had happened in camps. The border was proposing to interview survivors in our own languages, this letting himself attack. himself and in wrong words. Boarder got rejection letters from a host who opposed work quietly. The American Church conference in Dubinheim Foundation, the benedgressed and federal government. He kept going and it wasn't clear to me what was driving me. It seemed to be more than scholarly news. But among the grand applications, newspaper clippings, boxes and boxes of archival papers. It was not a single personal artifact. New reflections, new memoirs, not one personal note. who's Trump diamond. Motor died 40 years ago and it's only daughter Elena died childless in 1985.

But I don't remember his ever talking about himself in the world. Why do you think that was? Well, I think I think it reflects tragedy in his life and that he had abandoned his early life. And I think there was a schism between him and his early life. Here are some parts of his early life that would be full of human sword and the movements I saw from the exhaust. into a band. He had married in Russia when he was 20 years old, and divorced two years later. I talked to the family who story in Israel, who says that border convert to Christianity to their head, and that this was the reason he swore to life. Border fled Russia in 1919 after the Bolshevik Revolution, taking his daughter Elena with him. Someone who swised family accused him of abducting Elena, who was taking her without mother's consent. He also changed his name, so by the time he arrived in Chicago. There's no longer that the Avail Microsoft Black and Jew, the Dr. David Abler-Bore, scholar-led up from tears. Meanwhile, his wife stayed in Latvia, held onto her name and identity, and was executed in a ghetto in 1941. Just before both were appeared in Time Magazine, for his study of bad news and burns. It's hard to resist the pattern that having betrayed is the reason. art is study of the people of the Holocaust, in this determination to get there, in the capture stories, in their purest telling, it's hard to resist the interpretation that in part is a tone for.

In the end, after more than a year of writing graphic papers, he went without a official planning. He had money from the star, donations from a few associates, and a long-termist life insurance. I should point out again just how. uninterested the rest of the world was important in here. The project was a one-man effort from start to finish. He worked without translators and operated the equipment on his arm. Often positive on Tangled War and the Bust of Wood fishing on him. He would show up in the safehouse or refugee camp as well, tears find a quiet choir and begin his questions. The school is at 10, 9 minutes. The interremus, Mr. Yogan-Best friend, 22 years old.

She told me about the board, said, go in there because you want to be a star. And I think the pipe looked for him. I mean, I knew where he was. And then I introduced myself, let's how that interview took place. I think that we set the course at the table for each other. And the record was on the table, actually. Remember, it was a red web core. Why are we caught? And of course some kind of a military in those days because I mean if you could actually have a tape A Y and that would be caught your voice for something And I haven't seen before Do you think that a researcher talked to refugees after the war A psychologist of all people They showed the appropriate sense of opinion But that's exactly the way things went Once a writer was so upset by both his illusions And she still refuses to have her in a republished And his bass remembers, water minus water minus water minus the directions. I said same interview in me and he was very strong. He looked at me and he has very serious expression. He said, and what happened if you left the house? And where did you end up after the house? Where did you go and why did you have to eat the meat? He wasn't a thorough interviewer, but he was very stern. And then he took off here. You can't look left, alright. Just look at them. make sure that you don't look at anything else. But I will choose to because in Europe or the teachers I  that. In this two months in Europe, border went from a passive pointy so it's not so atrocities. It's known probably as much as anyone along.

Birmingham Offsman was a young psychologist at UCLA when border first arrived. And he wasn't charged with the reading room of the psychology department there. I just think we just didn't realize the historical significance. In part when he published. It was still, I think people had enough of the terrible stories that had appeared in newspapers finally. And in a point, it was because he was not some public celebrity. There was a lack of publicity and acclamation of the work of the time. And in Salting, he's just sitting in a little reading.

I didn't know. who Paul Rayon was until he crashed on his motor scooter in front of the school, and he became the first person we ever saw killed. I'd never heard of Sunny Tea'sdale, until Mary Lou showed me the hikis on her neck. I thought the sky was just a boom, until I heard him singing panace and jellicas with a cigarette and his mouth. Then I knew his name was Johnny and the lorio for the rest of my life. I didn't know Casper James. Until While my uncle was buried at his parents' funeral parlor, Hi, he said in the lobby, we go to school together. Linda Hall was just to grow with a missing finger until she taught me all the words to a slide in the family's Joan song at the swimming pool. He was from Africa and he was cute. I wrote Chimemway down on a piece of paper so that I could practice it and stop asking him what his name was. He said his mother was... to Zan from the Leonard Cohen song, but I could never remember his name. That's Quincy, they said pointing to the boy on the high diving board who was afraid to jump, and everyone yelled in unison. Jump, jump, jump.

I didn't even think of him as having a name. I never knew Zero's real name. He sold heroin on Madison Avenue. Everyone started calling him Zero, because just saying his real name would supposedly bring you bad luck. A neighborhood took away his name, so they could feel a little... more safe. My dad could never remember names, so every actor he didn't  on television he called a child a luster or a degenerate. I would say, the show would be Italian pedophile is coming on and he would hurry to the living room. My dad said he never paid for anything smaller than his fist. Just a tuck of gun in his box of shorts. We need to grab the gun. because he said there could be rats out there. He got a license so that he could sell flowers on the corner downtown. The name on the license set, Leonard O'Neill. Who the hell is that, I thought? Everybody I ever met called my dad, buddy. My dad called me, Dumbo, because he said I had big ears. My mother called me, Sputnik, because my eyes were so big. My dad named me Heather after a woman who taught him to read. after he dropped out of school when he was in grade 3. So that was my first name and for a long time my middle name was who. I had countless last names  Heather who used to go out with Derek, Heather who kissed Marco at the dance, Heather who told Jeremy that her name was Butterfly, Heather who had her shoes stolen in the park, Heather who wears that ugly blue ski jacket, Heather who has a sister. and Judy. Heather who has a dad who used to rob banks. Heather who thinks she's better than everyone because she says she was being carnated. When you get your name, you are just a little baby and have no say about the matter. Your parents could get your name from anywhere. You could have a name that comes from an ugly relative or out of the Bible. It could be something they heard shouted out at the swimming pool. It could be the Spanish name for bird, a strange name, a name your parents spelled wrong and no one could ever say right. Still, when people learn your name, they think they know all about me.

Our Tenguza has this story that how things change in our life, and in our whole family's life actually, when it went to the past that they interpreted one way, suddenly got a different thing. Oh my life, I thought my mother was difficult and crazy. My brother and sister stood too. That's how we thought of her for decades until recently. And we learned. It was a very different explanation for why she acted the way she did. We all have memories of her craziness. Here are my sisters Leslie and Liz and my brother John. I think I might have an important kindergarten. I want the kitchen broken. All dishes. Just broken things. Everywhere. She's just breaking all. She's moved. All set. She picked up a jar of relish. She turned. around and just, whoop it, pit-stead at the wall, and it smashed on the wall, and I see another relish, dripping down the wall, and just doing your own things, just in a moment of world . I remember being older in high school, being at the malls, and she lost her comb, and she just was crying and green, and I remember really consoling her and saying, who knew it was a comb? Hmm, here it's right here and I felt so bad. Mom went into a highway by the sunfish. And took a plate, full safely, and wept me on top of the head. And yeah, I quickly left the house and I remember sitting on a stone wall, , pretty upset, snocked by the habit and I felt this warm sensation that we had in the next day. and was actually leading to my skull, was serious, and quite a stitches. But it's a lot of say so. But maybe I'm not a confused and the position she had on the other side. She was smart, she was adventurous. She took us to the original production of hair in London. When I was 13 years old, she told me that we'd be out of biography of Malcolm X. Let's work out. still have. She had friends who thought she was a real character in fun and even some of our friends thought she was cool. But for us things I always felt pervious on the room. She was unpredictable, she could be scary and we all tried in our own ways to protect ourselves and make these moments. Being the oldest, I would try to keep the house and thinking somehow that would keep my mother and her. My sisters spent as much time to say, cut out of the house. Leslie once asked my parents, she could live. another theme. I remember how I missed a Elizabeth Young when she got upset. She held a breath and touched her past out. I always do did this as her own special way of escaping. By the time we were adults, we'd all decided to keep our excuse from her. None of us live far away, but we'd easily go three or four months or much longer. without seeing. When we did see her, it was usually because we initiated it, not her. It was a zip that just never occurred to her to make connections with a family. I remember once I was babysitting my niece and nephew, and I took them to pick up my mother, so we could all do something together. When my mother got in the car, my nephew, who was for it, took me and asked, in the club. It was a family joke about my mother, but if she was this bad now, just wait to see her. And in fact, she reached her 70s and it helped again to climb. She became a kind of nightmare. She had become severely athletic and frail, but lied about some doctors in the center of our efforts to assist her. To make things worse, she also started with her memory. By the time she had a second hip surgery, she had become so confused and agitated. She slugged in her eyes. She went that chart with the hospital took seriously and she was sent to a site to eat. The doctors there did some routine taskings. What we were then told was so amazing to take months to fully absorb. I knew you're Zeva of 1999, six months after hearing that report. I began recording my siblings' reactions. The doctors heard our descriptions of her behavior combined with what they saw on her skin. and they said that it was very possible, which she has had some brain damage most of her life. I think that for me, and I think I don't know, but I think maybe too much, but that was just one of the stunning moments in all of this for me because, oh my life, I just thought that was just difficult, that's where she was. thought she was just that way. But when it was that when I heard it from someone else and they said that they had even physical evidence of it, it just changed things in an instant. The Kaskan showed that my mother has Ponto-Loges syndrome, which is a shrinkage of Ponto-Loges brain. She may have been born with it or it may have been resolved. some childhood illness or accident. In any event, for as long as we've known her, she's had it. Just with that diagnosis, there's a sense of relief because it's no longer in unknown. Prior to that I think that I wrote my mom-off as being a very malicious person and not just just think that there was a nasty cyber birth. personality that she was in control of. And I guess that was what I learned is that the bad side of the personality was not necessarily something that she's in control. It was an enormous thing to take you. She'd always been a mystery that we never met. imagined that I'm asleep. She'd done so many things on her feet and his scary. She blow up at such small holes. when my brother put too much soap in the sea, I mother got so enraged she put him in his room. Said he was set and threatened to send him to an institution. Suddenly, he didn't seem all in the box. My mother was put on medication, so slowly began to help her. She was shopping in Tagina's car. She showed appreciation for awesome staff. Then she acted gracious in ways I had to have seen her. After a month and a half in the site hospital, she was moved into a nursing home. But by then, she was experiencing serious memory loss. And I felt  I was looking at the end losing my mother at the same time. I'm sorry. I know how I am good. How are you? Thank you. So, , super good, you're sleeping. It's my birthday. Yep. March, yep. I  to feel all about it. Sunday. Sunday. It's daddy's Cafe. So big. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can hear that my mother is losing her memory. But when I listen to this conversation, what strikes me most is the ease in our voices. How normal we sound. The way my mother laughs at herself. I mean, mom, , hugged me three times today. , just me goodbye twice. , that'd be so very... much for what it, , a great day. And I don't remember, I'm never saying that stuff. We kind of got this  six to eight, we window of mom being  this wonderful, , I mean, she just couldn't have been any more of the Iranian fun to be around. Laughing. and just looking so much better and  having good color or skin, she put on weight, I mean I had to see a lot of makeup and bazoy in here, I was fixing her hair and it was just really sad because I'm sort of thinking wow   what would life been if mom had done this person went out It's made us all wonder what would she have been ? Maybe she would have stayed married to my father, and maybe she would have published one of the books she wrote instead of destroying everyone. And maybe it wouldn't be so remarkable to us now when she behaves in normal ways. It's also hard not to wonder about how we would be more grandchildren, with one of us the accomplished, would be happier. Of course, these are impossible. questions. I'm did a lot of things that affected my childhood and I'll never forgive them. Of all my siblings, my sister Leslie Merev had the most difficult relationship to my mother. Leslie is the youngest, we see only one who ever lived alone. It was no one else around to pushing her from my mother's craziness. And as soon as she finished high school, Leslie joined the army to get herself away. It's very stressful, very confusing for me. It's going through a lot of change that she put me through. And I understand it's she's probably sick of time. I guess I just have a mark to it. She asked me once on my child, it was. Did you have a happy child such a great? Just out and we were at a restaurant eating. and we were just having conversation about nothing when he wrote importance. , just sort of a small talk, yes. And she just came out with this question. Maybe she was lucid at that moment, she just needed to know. And I told her I did. The other night I went to visit my mother at the nursing home, as we were leaving her floor to go out to dinner, my mother wanted to stop by the activities room to say goodbye to some friends. A man named Patrick who's in a wheelchair and can't speak very well, called out in his slow voice, a low Dorothy. My mother looked directly at him in an allowed stern voice said, and you get out of that chair and take a walk for him. For an instant I cringe flashing back to the countless times my mother was appropriated in public. But then Patrick started laughing and my mother started laughing and his often happens now I was reminded how much has changed. Part 10 Gesso is a teacher and visual artist and Boston. This is her first story for the medium. What can I say no name? What's an attitude? What's a harmony? What's up, bro? Watch the good bird, watch the name of this song. Look at the good bird, not the words that are wrong. We're the good start, you should start, too. Too bad, it looks  a plan. You're the good bird. Where the smoke and on song keep a good word. On the tip of your tongue, too be clever. And in the same... That's not where I am, actually. You might have learned that good work, do that. That's for, you call that love. Consider please the word love. Love between mothers and children, up between spouses. Once the word is applied to a feeling, is it possible that we are not all referring to the same thing? Down in the Goldstein hasn't thought about that question. If there was no such word as love, our vocabulary would be richer, and we'd have to struggle harder to find the right word. words. Everyone would be so long-winded and Shakespearean in their range of emotional expression. The word love came long and wiped out all sorts of terms in a semantics of blood bath. Without the word love, people would speak in terms of sensations, this sensation of standing waste-deep in a tub of warm pumpsauce, or this sensation of being tickled on the back of the knees. Some would say they felt  they had just swallowed a honey soap boxing glove, and others might say that they were feeling  they're got to be knocked out. spread across the kitchen floor.

Sometimes you'll call something love because we don't know what else you call it. But I first started dating Holly. There was one night where I was double riding her back home from downtown on my bike, and she kissed my neck and rubbed my back through my t-shirt. We were going uphill, and she knew I could use all the encouragement I could get. We had spent the evening with some friends we didn't especially , just because we didn't have the heart to say no to them. We should go out more often, she said from behind me. The way I hate everybody makes me love you more. Was that a moment of love or merely an instance of lack of hate? With Christian, I thought I couldn't be in love because our knees were too big. They were the size of grapefruit, and I could not see myself being in love with woman whose knees were that big. They were ludicrous really. By thinking was that it was a good thing they were so ludicrous, because they kept me firmly anchored. If I thought for even a second that I might be falling... and love, all I had to do was think of those big fat knees of hers, and then one day I found myself kissing. I had to leap over it right in her url to get to that, but it wasn't love that was on the other side. It was just self-congraged to let me pass on my own back, over how I could move beyond petty this little fat. When I was 16 there was a summer I spent in Wildwood New Jersey, where one night while walking down the boardwalk feeling lonely and depressed. A girl a few years old did in me. came spinning down the boardwalk, for arms spread out. She came right towards me, and then when we were faced to face, she kissed me. Just  that, because she was drunk or stout, that she had kissed me. For the rest of the summer I couldn't pass the woman on the boardwalk without thinking that we should somehow be meeting in a kiss, that that's how life should really be. In that moment where our lips touched, the way it suddenly brought into alignment, the private and speak of a hope. with some heart, with the uncontrolled mislead outside world. It felt  as surely as anything outside of every experience, a moment of love. I say this as an adult who has had serious relationships in it, and I can't think of another word of love to describe what I felt that day on the boardwalk. And that was it. She just walked out. When I was a little kid, my mother's favorite thing was the trainer. had through a door frame or around the corner and bite me or my sister on the ass while exclaiming, boy is this a toughest. I spent much of my childhood walking around our house always on my guard, always feeling  she can strike at any moment. He was never really any good with words, so this was sort of her version of a love solid. At least that's how I've chosen to see it. He could also say it was filthy and damaging, but if you want to see something, or even need to see it as love, it left. It feels a lot more  love.
