So if you want your selected shorts to be on Friday's today, and the BBEZ is re-brugged cast my Friday night program, your radio playhouse right here right now at Purdue, in Pangut. There's a little radio programming experiment. The idea is that since my program is radio- storytelling, plus music. It has something common with perhumpment and might be the kind of thing that Garus Q regards would enjoy. The BDEZ is going to try this after a few months and WDEC management welcomes your thoughts and reactions of programming ideas. The radio plans has been on the radio on Friday nights now for several months and you haven't heard it. The stories are told in a wide variety of stumbles by a wide variety of writers and performers. And some of the programs just happens right here in The radio. For example, this week's program is about love for the New Townsend staff. And we begin with this cassette here that we have a friend sent for the Valentine's Day holiday. This is a guided meditation for singles presented by Frida Conquer. And , normally if you're going to make some of the stuff you actually would give the person and tell thethren you're구 significa oh to Fred comin' produced by something called conscious singles action incorporated, fabricated and today more. And this cassette has lots of ideas from things that singles, conscious singles from boys, can do so they don't feel bad on holidays or Valentine's Day. , you can give yourself a special day along with these people you can do in holiday. You can keep an effort, and choose the area of dance. Thank you. Bye. flowers for yourself, you can  canmons, you can canmons special ritual, special me and cast for you. You can even write yourself, letters about you. Oh, and you can listen to the very wonderful music on that day. Welcome to WB EZI Chicago. Do you have any idea of playhouse? I'm Eric. glass. And  you didn't have to prepare an advance for this hour. We have prepared the whole thing for you. We have set the table with candles. It's all set. Oh, conscious singles. And couples, you couples who are sensitive to your consciously single friends. Very special hour for you. Stay with us. What's amazing about this tape to make? Is it's utter lack of modesty about what it promises? It doesn't just promise to make you feel a little better about being single. It is categorical. It promises complete spiritual and emotional peace. When you're done listening to this cassette, it says, you will be at peace with being single. You feel happy, you feel filled, you can do it, and simply be dancing. what could be easier? What could be easier? Or you need to do this intention to go. This isn't done. I don't know, it's that working for me. Is it, are you breathing there at home? Are you? Being a car? are you breathing right now? And is this happening or are you finding peace? Chussus is the sentence of a... You're the rest. It's up to you. That is the sentence you never hear in the English language. I've never used it when people get into the construction and the rest is up to, that's a pretty common construction in school, in sales situations, in over TV, , just  you hear that a lot and people never go into the construction and the rest is up to... in... end up with me. No, it's always you. You're the rest. It's up to me. She has a sister's thing that I find. Nesmerizing, but incomprehensible and it's this. You don't need to listen. What is that about? , she's in the tape business. She's not , , it's not  a video thing. It's a cassette with sound. You don't need to listen. We don't say that, , if at the beginning of our radio show, we would say to you, Hi, we've been working really hard. really good show for you and there's one other thing you've got to know. We would never, unless it was some sort of reverse psychology thing,  what I mean? we've used all that. We've used all the promotional tactics we could think of. Now we're doing reverse psychology. But the reverse psychology what we're saying is, that will be the day. So, side one of the thing, is kind of warm up. the actual meditation. And side two is the guided meditation itself. Chases go back, breathe deeply, which we have all been practicing for a while in the show. And then she says, pretend you're having a dream. And the dream she has is pretend is astonishingly but now, pretend , work loaded, mind clouds. You can make me snack me Buy me Up Over the roof Yep Loading Over the roof And up Over the roof You don't get to pay for dreams This is when you wouldn't even rent I mean you wouldn't even rent this one at the video store See Photonidream And of course, because all the elements have to be involved with this air and this clouds and float past the mountain, and then you come a course to a river. And this is where she gets to a hard matter. Remember the promise of the tape is that she is going to make you feel good about your single hood, and it piece with it. And how does she do it? It's really fascinating. She does it by having you imagine the person who you're meant to be with. You can understand. In other words, the whole way that you're going to come to peace with your single hood is you just envision the day when you're not single. That seems  kind of a cheat to me. That isn't being a piece of some good. That simply believing that your single hood is a temporarily delayed state that will cycle foot. What is that about? what is the,  what is the bet that she's hedging there? , , but we should try not to offend,  okay, because people will follow with the males, because people follow with the females, and then we just want to be sure  we get everybody in. And the people who involved with what? Of course. and touch you, and you will be so good to you. See, to try me, let yourself be the way you want to be taught. You might fall for the touch you showed me, with all the amnes. You will be the only way for me. You may be the best. at this point in the tape. I have to say for me anyway, it kind of starts to work up. I start to think , yeah, I do want to do this person who's going to hold me at end end end end be the person who can totally understand me. I have to say that you have to do it. I mean, it's interesting to me about this is not just that it's so effective, but that it's such a wrong life. I mean, if you've ever been in an actual relationship, no human being, you're going to be with it, is going to be there to touch you the way you want to be touched every time and talk to you the way you want to be talked to every time. In fact, it is to be a comfort to someone. I think this is a sign of how much we want this. that we want this person. In the New Yorker Magazine, the screen, John Update writes about Lana Turner's seven husbands. He says, do something ridiculous about a woman who takes seven husbands. As if she had rummaged through the drawers of masculineity and come up with seven drawers. I think that actually what's ridiculous about it isn't that there was anything wrong that's ridiculous about it, but didn't have an idea. Ah! Wait! He says this is all the same. Hey! Hmm, what is going on? We'll end these systems! Be careful more! Come on, James. Come on, guys! Ting, talk to me! with those seven guys that they would force. What's ridiculous is the notion that she could be married to seven different people and be happy with none of them, that she herself would not be able to find happiness with any of those kinds. And the reason why she didn't find happiness with those guys was because she was waiting for another guy. She was waiting for the guy on this cassette. He doesn't exist. what? What do we do? with that dream, , the dream that love is going to knock the door. in some mellow drama,  a TV sofa. What do we do about it when we heard love call before and watch ourselves messing up? In the sound. That's me. And it's... Talk about how she can make it rock hard again I happen to swim You're really feel good, shum-ta It's nothing wrong Being in love with someone Yeah You're a baby You're a baby Oh, baby Well our special pre Valentine's Day look program in three acts at one yearning with setbacks, act 2, sex and sex and sex, act 3, awaiting. I'll be good to make, I'll be good to go, you'll be together I'll be good to go, you'll be together I'll be good to go, you'll be together I'll be good to go, you'll be together Love and have love That's it. Back one, you're in it. We begin with this image. A woman in a crushed red velvet dress lying on the stomach on the ground. Dress has a train in 60 feet long, trailing behind her. Her face will take the face of someone who's been making out in the back seat of a car for hours. Come out this swollen puppy and kissing. Have stick a smear everywhere on a mountain chain. Dad is on her nose. She's kissing the ground, and the thought of the purpose. She kisses the ground, tries to fresh coat of lipstick, kisses again, the pie's another coat, kisses again. Scone through 11 tubes of lipstick in 25 hours. There's that sweet lipstick he perfume in the air. He's spelling out words. on four, in lipstick. Each letter is two feet high. The word said, there was a time when I worship the ground you walked on. I'm making a monument to my ex-boyfriend. One is next to you with a theme. And the ex-boyfriend she says was everything she wanted to be, creative together. She said she did worship for her husband, walk home. She said she was a kind of person who was always in love with the fantasy of being involved. And I worked really hard to maintain that fantasy in the face of all information about reality, reality, the situation. When she first started kissing the ground. and public as performance art, a part of her wish that the ex-boyfriend would find out. Maybe he would see that she had put him behind her. Maybe that for grabs. Maybe it didn't touch me. Two among us has not known this particular mix of conflicting feelings towards next. Joy Lefine moved on to other kissing projects. I kissed all the names of my ex lovers onto public property. I kissed the names on parking A METAZON. and sidewops and glass windows. And when I kissed our names, I actually would flash that person and really dwell on them. And it was the very kind of releasing activity. When I got to the last person's name, I kissed it onto this big concrete wall. And I thought, this is the last person in my life. This is the lamp. relationship that I've had. This is actually the last relationship I will ever have. And I saw that a song myself is now I was going to take this role of the eternal skinster. When she does these performance art pieces kissing the ground, she says it's sometimes she feels  this non-entity. People stand here, talk about what she's doing if she's not there. And when she leaves, they walk on the words she's made with her mouth. Trying to make her big red blur on the ground. And Julie the pain says there's something about hissing and pulse foot for hours. It's partly  being out of control. Partly very peaceful, medically. Besides along the ground, hissing out the pattern to each letter. You have a day of this kind of came in selling peanuts for the homeless. And he walked in and he said, is this what I think it is? And I said, I don't know what you think it is. I think it is, I think it is all it marks. I said yes he said, I wish I were the guy that these were meant for. we've actually loved some and been loved. And then just the ear and it goes up that you feel  you have it. Mark O'Brien is a writer in California, but because of a childhood case, Paulio, he lives most of each day in an iron pond on his back. He's the subject of this amazing little film, New film, called Breathing Lessons. And the film is remarkable because it's a battle guy in an iron pond, but it is completely unscentenental. And in certain moments it's also pretty funny. And the film is... by Jessica Yuh, and it was just at the Sundance Film Festival. In Jessica Yuh gave us permission to exit, a memorable little scene from the film, here on our radio show. Because he's in the Iron Lord, Markovarian has attendance, cook and pop them out during the day. And during the film he explains that these days, he always has men do this job, because when he had women do the job, he kept following love with them. And the love was never reciprocated. He went back one of these women. Perpale Perfect Skin, her strong plushy legs drove me to ecstasy to spare. C.C. Talked with me as a human instead of her savagely crippled employer. Puzzle we'll see in a bit desire in your name. In this film. Hi hi, it's that sir here. 87 or 86. I forget we're  just so pretty crazy hours.

There was a businessroom that said, that's 37, there were this set of magical training when he would definitely have access to a wide energy primalised EQ distances. Shall we take his rounds? I thought myself as the Empress parent of the world, but trust legs stop in someone. The way has sex with the fact is my deacord, how a body. And cow was very kind to me. She kissed me, I was just out and yeah, you're too gross, I felt . Trust was very unaccount. She kissed me right there. The end of the course was so quick, it was, I hate to say it but it was quick, thank you man. And it wasn't as quick as I thought it would be, thank you, and care with the woman, speaking straightly from it. First part of the day, I think I'd  to give it a kiss. Usually Marker Brand can't be outside of his Iron Man for more than 45 minutes. But when the set surges with him, he was outside his tube for longer than he almost ever goes out. And he didn't even use his portable respite. I didn't need it for an hour and a foot. Now with the... She thinks sex is respiratory therapy, maybe better calipy treatment. But here after the S.R. The child would be present, and he said, in some of them, saying, the surgery would change my life. They said, very well, I thought that every one of you will tell him that she's been here so far. Nothing happened. Now, to take you by someone's sexual view goal, what does it do in good? Or someone else's business, sexual view goal? You just can't be a goal. You have to be well-behaved. How's the kind of view out of you there? This is Luis Rodriguez in the pieces called Wading. What made the waiting so painful? The woman had called, she was on her way. Tense I waited sitting at the kitchen table. There had been too many nights waking up to bottles and books on the floor. Too small children. parked on blankets in the corner, long aids of bad. Dreams of women yet to be touched to be snout in the bed. Up on a hill hidden by wood and shingle shacks, alongside curbless roads visited by nobody, in less than half in the evening. A long aids of bad. Heming holes into walls with fists, tears streaming down my face at sex home beds, looking at old holes, healing baby. taking out trash and thinking of earth. It ain't so bad. I couldn't stand. Look through personal ads in the weekends, made phone calls, road letters came across video day, and got sent along with you. I called after three false starts, lady said, she would be her Saturday, it's Saturday, and I'm gone nuts. And our final news, please. and old stuck a white basement room. You can't miss it. Cholga Fidi on the front door. She came, made her pits. Saw the curtain my eyes. I always spoke with my eyes, damn it. And longing for sweet companionship. Not a drunken homeboys or angel dusted street women for the mother of my kids, out at sunny grounds, sucking collours and high balls, and shooting out wicked smiles at discord out. Then! looking in my eyes and then stop refused to sell me the video date refused to take the check. This can't help you, she said. And walk about. He asked me to go for a walk. I said no, even though I knew I wanted to. This story about one in the war is well but. We were sweeping out the cottage, cleaning up. We just turned it the home. We had to leave that afternoon with. in a couple of hours away. He just looked at me in that expression, not sure of how he should look. He knew I would go for a walk. He knew I wanted to. I knew I would as well, but I wanted to say no to try it out. I gave in on this committee. So we walked. I kept stones watching me. They were trees on your side and thus. He said, I don't have anything to say. Tonight. I just wanted to walk and think. I said stupid things. Or maybe it is that they weren't stupid, but saying them out loud, sound and so stupid. He said, how do you feel? I said, I'm sorry. No. I hate it. He knew it was going badly when he began to feel miserable. I tried to think of something to say. I said, I don't understand you. thought we were  but we find in the night I hate when we started mountains who didn't  things to hurt me and you're done. Why are you doing this? I hate this conversation. I hate this kind of conversation. He said, I hate this conversation too. I hate it so much. I said, well you're the man. You're the one making it all new figured out. He said, I'm the one who's supposed to fix this that it. I said, we can't. be friends who can't. I can't. It's not what I want. He knotted me down and do all the dishes. I thought they were just in. After a while he said, how you feel now, this is happening to me. What? I said, he told me something only made me mad. He wanted someone who didn't want him. They took a long time to be over. So what I thought he cares. It's not the same. He said, can't really be friends. We can talk on the phone, we can't see each other's. But will we talk to be friends, for some, no. He said, what will we say, hi, how are you, my friends? I don't know. We walked in, was high, when we appreciated. The statue of a bunch of rats, my peanut their good phone. and white paint. We picked up one of the last bookings. It was baking up, sawing pep, white spin-on lines, and acrylic, some bits of sparkly dust going to happen in the sun. He stood holding it to his chest for a moment, and then working around, gently put it down somewhere else, and it's been put away. There. Does it work better now? Good steps. I thought that curatation wanted what this meant to him. I guess it was because he'd done something. Sometimes just doing any one thing, he made you feel better. He doesn't mean why. So look at his face picking up the rock, moving the walking. It all made me so timid. Do you want to turn around, I said. You said yes, looking at you, she's coming. And... know, knowing it's a wrong thing. We sat on a mound of tall, really grass, down from the tree. It was cool. I said, what are you thinking? He said tall grass, and looked at me. His eyes were white open. I smiled, he said things  that, and I loved you. He lounged, and I sat, and picked up twigs. He said, what's he said, and why is he here? reaching for pieces of bark, different model of surfaces, rough, but warm and comfy in my hands. I placed them care for the tools. He said, what do you do with? I said, I'm making a pile for a little animal defined into use and besides the bark is so pretty. He said, I'm breaking up little pieces of twig and hiding them around, who laughed at you and said, yeah, that's me . Hiding stuff  nobody could sing. I wondered if he loved me if he really loved me. That morning in bed he said, I love you. I love you. But when I said then why? He couldn't answer. Now he said, I  you so much, so very much. And I noticed he didn't say, hello. It didn't matter so much. I just looked at the words for a while. I looked at the sound the words made after that. They were sad. I knew he loved me, and did he didn't know what that meant. And the truth was that I didn't knew. And I wasn't sure you made any difference. We walked back to the cabin while doing each other, and was warm again. Her bodies were wet against each other. What felt good? We walked up to the house and held a tentatly for a moment. And I got too good. I watched him walk up the steps for show please green door. The breeze caught the door and it swung from him on the back and forth. I waited outside for him to lock up. He sometimes was still looking down couldn't stay. Do you enjoy the session?

It's an unsuited discovery that one of the most politicized aspects of sex in the earth. Honda Mut. I just want to know. I've the last one to know about this because the first time I had sex with that economy was only a few months ago. I was dating this 21-year-old Irish boy, who was naughty. After the first time he skipped it, he never used to be. At the time I was living with my best friend Sarah, she and I were married and told it. every one morning leaving my lovely boyfriend's bald out. I went and extored a Sarah's room sat down on bed. So half the sex was gone. But not the greatest ever but vigorous sort of sweet. Pause. I wanted to tell her about Polka and because I knew she was assuming we were using that. Staking us every day for good, righteous people instead of bad, there's hospital to go. That were, in the long-term, when I felt  I was lying. We're not using condoms. I've murdered it out looking down. There's a long pause. Gosh, I aren't even. Just dead. I looked up. I'm staring each other for a second. And we burst out laughing. It may be hard to convey the strange pittiness at this moment. Anyone who didn't go to college played 80s. who Sarah and me and for our girlfriends, safe sex was the marker of modern straight post-page embarrassed. She has sex with Bushy Wands and when she wants but she always returns for sale. It was about self-respect and it was about the down cause. Sisters knew that sisters used cotton. Well, that was that. Here are some of the sisters now. I really am. I can't even do it. I use And then... Oh, God. And he moves to go. Well, kind of. He is a monster while, , right around the time that I know that I'm ovulating. Statistics seem to indicate that in fact, very few of the corrective-save sense. Nationwide, only about 20% of current was sexually active when he was 40 or 40. And one out of five of those continents were then hadn't used one the last time. Game Man Contrast. seem more careful, but even fear, a San Francisco secret showed only captain and saying these caught every time you have sense. Interestingly, these studies, the most current according to the Centers for Disease Control, are four years old and are based on data collected four years before that at the height of my alleged safe sex vigilance and that of my friends. So what now seems clear is that a massive nationwide campaign to shape our sex lives. There. And no one is talking about that. Most of us are not practicing safe sex and never did. At least not in that every time, whole time, no exceptions way, safe sex is weenrid, it's all about. And now, nearly everyone I know since we've paralyzed in this weird state, it's part shame at what we see as laziness that uses content. And part stubborn attachment to our secret decision, not to use them as often too clear of shit. For instance, I started out scared. about that, and I was born to be a doctor. I had to rationalize what we were doing by reminding myself of Jesus' love, junkie, and that he got ahead from a boy that was once and had not liked it. But then fear faded to guilt, and now I don't even think guilt is sense. I'm not using condoms, and my women friends are not condoms. Because when we look around, we are not dying of mysticism, and neither is anyone of sleep. And it's been that way for two years. kind of a sexual non-drug using the simply that not as good, , much fear to second grade AIDS death. To be always being one college boy. Only 8% all diagnosed AIDS-based, in the United States, and we have such a contact point to this. But we keep calling ourselves ways, I'm friends now. I think, feeling  bad, bad, bad, bad, giving up safe sex, giving up that solidarity we believed in, that I'm seeing, but you are all. All going to be at risk together. Gay men, street women, women, crosslines of praise and class age. All of us knited against a single deadly comment. Five years later, I think it's only a matter of time. For the praise, no glove, no love, sense to us. The way sisterhood is powerful, sounds to the mothers.
