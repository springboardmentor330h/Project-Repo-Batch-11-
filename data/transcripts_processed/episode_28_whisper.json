  "text": "the BB-easy shadow, publicating international, to American life, my request. This is my detective book. I just kept, I would go to library and all this puts out. And yeah, yeah, I take notes, learn words. So this book, just described it as an old, I'm loosely book with, , sort of, 1960s era, hours are all over it and stickers are all over the cover. Really text us. How many of us today have had a memory we entertained that dream? A being a private eye, a being pojacked or a bombower, locked or something. There are just so many. I'm Mara Klasin, of course, every week on this program we bring your variety of stories documenting everyday life in these United States. And on today's program, we're going to be a very important part of the story. We're going to... here a number of stories about people who want to be text about 10 children. And we'll begin with one of the poorest expressions of this desire you could possibly find. And that is, a child's handmade detective notebook. Andre and the photos brought it in. And one of the things that's interesting about it. And I think this is probably a typical problem for many armchair wannabou detectives. And it's that it records your desire to get a clue in some cases. But sadly for her, she was leading a life where there were really not that many cases to be sung. And here's some mystery update for our June 6th, 1981. Hold with you. I'm not sure. You're a reference. In June 6th, 1981, 433 PM, no new mysteries. How to press it. Next time, three, June 7th, 1981, 534 PM, no new mysteries. June 8th, 1981, 677 PM, no new mysteries. It goes on. Eating out of everything, actually. the words to make , I feel that in any case, in any case, in any case, in any case, the book is divided into sections, names , solve, unsolve. You can tell the difference, the things inside, solve, and unsolve stuff, they're exactly the same. There's a section on how to secretly code messages, there's the record of a successful case where I'm going to get a thousand suggestions, necklace, take a place, no ground, and . Your pamphlets on the FBI, it's a fingerprint stamp or a call. How you can help the FBI stop in the prison fraud? It's a tabular issue. So many adult techs really don't spend enough time with them. They have a very sectionalist, top words and phrases in it. , treasury and portioned scheme. Yeah, especially it seemed  it's simply not had a club with my company. And so I, since the Q&A of how I just came to... Go to the assorted room of the FBI. the club. I guess to be sneaky or to be a detective or a private FBI club, something  that. First question is, do  why I get to be a transverse researcher? Number two, do who don't say so, but it ends with no way? And I don't do that. But I knew I 1981, but I don't know now. Number three, do you think your sneak answers? Yes, why? Well, I sneak snacks and spying is fun, and then twos. for it. what the four types of fingerprints are? You have a magnifying glass. Tell me about it. If you look at one of those things, just read Albert's text. , it's scoring. And a tie-breaking question, I guess you need it. Yeah, actually tied. What are the three things you should take on a mystery? What? Of course Iris. and at age 11, and dread the photos to the FBI. And got an application to become special agent. She's still done in the notebook, so I didn't pay just wrong. It asks if you've ever had an alias, but I've been your odd Andrea wrote, yes, he not. Right, again, that time. Can you point me in the history for the 11-year-old Andrea? None. Are you interested in the fingerprint examiner position in Washington, D.C. Can D.C. Are you willing to proceed to Washington DC or any other duty station at your own expense? Are you out on dress says? Yes. References and quote seekers, Trins at the card number. The application asks, Number of views are pointed. here, right? What happened? I thought that I would be a great FBI, because I have a 20-minute vision and I read that. , I've got a glass. Right, no, I don't know myself, but I did. But then I read, I got really depressed. In fact, here it is, quote from the story of the stupid service. A man who wants to join a secret service must be between 23 and 30 years old, at least 5-8 and not over 16-2 and 8. be a man. Yeah, and then I got upset because I'm trying to tell you, but and you're not a man. I don't know that. But I don't know. What is it about? The screen being a g-man, active, spook, sweet, private eye, putting around, you look at so many words. It's asking about having so many words. to the word snow. Today I put them, dream being private eye and I will have dream. I just want to be happy. At one of these, better given to the rest of the story of two armchair detectives in his own family, I'm going to hand over crime wave and curse right under the round room in the round palm, back to your world. I go out on the stick out. Me. with a real private eye right here in Chicago, in the location so perfectly sinister. That we cannot even disclose to you here or not for me. I felt it to my heart I'd   to read a show and learn about you and learn about your memories anduck out Ekwan wanna be detectives are just one of those things in Nisha Car Seo and Sar Fort, holding أنapolis when you're out to this myth though, one of those things, it just seems to occur a lot more in the movies than they ever do in real life. But I suppose some is not that. Why do you detect this? Somebody once said, and I would agree with this, that every good story is a detectives. Meaning every good story, in any genre, raises some big question that we can something that we want to find out. And then the process of the story, the reason why I'm out to this. we keep reading watching is we just want to know we want to know what's going to happen what is the thing  what the answer mysteries are just the stories from the space after the satisfaction of this kind of story in the stories possible the question couldn't be clear this crime we did it and how to end all is the hero right is shared we know the answer so there are only the things crime of course is it you see so many types of your reads and see so many TV shows that you step away even that you can actually do with the fictional characters in the shows. Alright, good. We have this story. I'm out of David's nose. That's it. My mother had a thing from the textants. They old, blind, or paralyzed, who was waist down, she was couldn't get enough. My older sister shared her English. The textive worship became something they practiced together. Swapping plot lines, and way out of mothers and daughters, change dressing زin's album. One television program would end in the next week again, filling our house with the constant dean of gunfire and swinging tires. downstairs the obese attack with the collectives breath on the bow of the drug world's pleasure craft, while up in the kitchen his elderly colleagues hurled himself on a low-grick wall, in pursuit of the baby face soon after night. Out your case coming, my mother would shout during commercial breaks. stopping her hand from the side of her mouth, Lisa would yell, Tobi's still tracking down leads, but I'm betting it's the Chinese guy with the eye patch and the ponytail. There's was a world of obvious suspects. Looking for the axiom murderer, try the emotionally disturbed lumberjack, glow it or a near the tool shed behind the victim's house. Who kidnapped the guidance counselor? Perhaps it's a 30-year-old tenth grade couldve the Gianhand will probably do how the day he is. It was no wonder these cases were solved some quickening. Every clue was italicized in the burst of seraging trumpets. In under questioning, the suspects snapped  two pits, buckling less time that took the soft boil and head. You want to know who said fired at the scape range? Oh, right, he was me. Salest five now, that's right me. I get in me. Give me a pair of scape and I'll hook a match as an upper and his whole pound down. You all. It's easy to solve in case none of the suspects were capable of telling the decent lie. It seemed that anyone could solve a murder just so long as they had a telephone, who hours of spare time in their wet form. My mother had all been in this. The more suspects she identified in the force of the season, the more confident she contained. Together she and my sister were telling the local news paper, speculated on each report of the phone. We know that the girl was held at night point on the second floor of her house. This is sad. Tapping a pencil and then straight forehead. So, probably the person who robbed her was not in a wheelchair. I'd say that's a pretty safe assumption, my mother and her. While you're at it, I think you might as well eliminate anyone confined to an iron law, listen to Sherlock. You're going at it all wrong. You're a guy broken and he held her at night point and made off 300,000. half, right? And a cockroach, a piece of shit. $300, and a cockroach, a forget, a clock, a radio. The important thing is it used to not. All right, what kind of a person is this? Lisa guessed it at my finish. Maybe she was at a restaurant and the cook noticed she had a lot of money in her market room. Right, my mother said, because that's what cooks do, is they call around the dining room floor, looking through the person's wall of food, so that he couldn't- out come on now, think, who uses a knife to commit a crime? In a world of guns, what kind of person would use a knife? Give up? It's just two little words, drug addicts, just that's a... A professional thief could use a gun, but even a second-hand gun costs money. A drug addict can afford a gun. They need all their money for their dope and smack, the hard stuff. These dopeers have a habit to feed every... minute of every day, which means they're always on the lookout for their next mark. This was a hair when added to file the girl home from the bank, parked his car around the corner, broken into the house, and robbed her at night. He can't afford a gun, what's he doing with the car? He's there, asked, and what about the clock radio? Screwed the damn clock radio, my mother said, and it's from the car, it was stolen. He took it last Thursday from that couple on Pamletoe. You saw the report. The brand new report. You thought it'd been stolen by Gypsy, and I said, you don't even have Gypsy as in this part of your tomb. I said the car had been taken by a gopatic. We'd use it for a couple of burglaries before selling you to a chop shop. Being go, there you have it. She crushed her cigarette, used the butt and called and asked some of the residents of the bottom of the black and dashed me. Her way of pronouncing this particular case was pronounced. What's next on her roster? Van De Legime. at 318 pool road, breaking in entering it in 5-4 times a hit and run traffic accident in a parking lot of swaying stay counts. It was always the work of a drug addict or a former police officer, a renegade. Well, if you hear my mother talk, you'd think the sunny, manicured streets of suburban wall and what's going with heroin is the needles poking to the sleeves and the padded police. It embarrassed me to hear her use phrases  copying. I have to go now, she said, I'm bothering you. My mother-in-law is back at the house, Jones and Earl Lodge. They give hard food, say, come again. Only I met work television in the office. I call the TV, they'd say, it didn't matter what you were watching when my mother or sister laid plane to one of the television's. You surrendered at the same way cars gave up the road, decided to advance in handy. I couldn't bear that he tacked his shells but made it a point to regularly checking the fugitive. This was a story of Dr. Richard Kimball, a man on the run. Paul Sleak used to recryme the did not commit who had hold on the opening credits that he changed his name and his identity. The notion of identity was illustrated by a man of shoe polish sitting on what appeared to be the scum surface of a motel dresser. Tatley stonthramor What, I asked, would nobody recognize him, but freshly shine shoes? Did he use the blackness phase? I don't get it. His hair, stupid, my sister Lisa said, he used it to die his hair. Lisa liked the fugitive because she said he's easing her eyes. The way she saw it, Dr. Kimball needs only two things. A one-armed suspect of love, woman. She failed them. understand that despite his brooding good looks, a man of his nature could never. Unlike her nightly line-up of swinging gum shoes, the fugitive had both the soul and an early, and remained a haunted man long after his wife's two-pillar and blood justice. Most programs discourage you from concentrating on heroes' dark and earwork. If the girlfriend was gone down at her makeup table, you knew there'd be another one next week, hey moisturizer, no questions at all. The fugitive had no fancy convertible or stylish red palm. He was cut from the different palm, my condom palm, the itchy condom. Lisa wouldn't know what sensitive blown or if he crawled into her lap in the list of days and an annoyed me when she labeled the fugitive as my condom shuff. It was one thing to sit in front of the television, second guessing a third rate detective program, but quite another to solve real case. We're well into our summer reruns when our household is shaken by a series of very real horns, no TV detective could ever hope to crack. Someone in our family who take into wiping their ass on the bath house. What made this exceptionally disturbing is that all of our towels were clutched coming. You'd be drawing your hair when, too late, you'd notice an unmistakable odor on your hands, head and face. There's nothing else. life in the suburbs promised that one might go from day to day without finding stool samples in the air. This sudden turn of events tested our resolve before leaving us to wonder who we were and where we as a people in the Gong Gong. So searching aside, it also called the Pliny of Hot Water, Alan's of shampoo, steel wool, industrial scrub brushes, blocks of harsh deodorizing stuff. The criminal hit off rebounds, causing just long enough. to convince her rest of us to define we say to let her guard down. I might spend 20 minutes carefully sniffing the towel, only to discover that this time used the washroom. Well, my mother said, something to the newspaper once on their morning. The person doing this is one sick individual, that much we know for certain. And the eat court, Lisa said, padding her head with a teacher. The most recent victim, she had washed her hair, so... many times now resembled the Y-resynthetic main of a 12-long. Everyone had their theories but no one had any hard evidence. Discounting my parents that still left six children in my grandmother, all possible suspects. I eliminated myself and because the towels were carefully folded, I excused my brother who, to this day, could not manage such a complex activity. We must smart to use the towels or to go with the purpose. And I watch. is my family took their seats at the table, waiting for some cryout of lunch but nothing to be done. My mother and sister had always thought themselves so wild and smart, but when pressed for a suspect they said only that this case was beneath them. If someone were to be murdered, kidnapped they'd rise to the occasion and finger the guilty party within an hour. This particular case however fell under the category of aggravated mischief and was there for unwörting the fashion ones… Whoever it was would listen to their conscience and best sooner or later, mean time, the mother would stop the limb crossing with white mouths, case of a child. Later that month, someone went through my father's top door, stealing a knee sock pack 112, Liberty Silver Dollars. I need my father's door, as well as I need my arm, everyone. That was how you occupied your time and had to house you yourself. You life into my father's drawers before moving on to a second hiding place in the shed. I had seen and counted these coins many to me all had, but we would go so far as to see. My father gathered us together in the dining room and listened as we each took turn, denying any involvement. Dollars come and silver? I never knew that. Is a government issue them at a knee soccer? Was that your idea? Okay, my father said, all right, I understand now. Nobody took my coins. I guess they just got tired of living cooped up a net dresser and decided to roll up the door and spend themselves on candy in magazines. That's what happened, isn't it? Oh, they're probably out there as we speak. Heaven themselves are grand old time, aren't they? This voice visited the highest register and rubbed his hands together as if he were considering a tray in rich desserts. Really good? Free it last with their whole life's article! Did you just feel the excitement? Then then make you just want to throw up your hands and scream! Lowered his voice to deliver a series of madens I didn't  catch. My mind was snagged and thought of those jubilant servant hours, rockets and busy with their first films and opinions. I pictured them splitting into groups and crowd from by night, reward any access and attention. It might prove difficult to all of a grass leaves, so I imagine the muddled in the carp and the sighting best stick to the roads and sightings. The thought of it made me laugh and when I did my father said, you think this is funny? You're getting a chocolate of this all you? I'm glad you find it so I'm used. Let's see how funny it is when I search your room, funny guy. My television research warrant guaranteed that your home will be trashed. in this was a different thing. Mine was the only teen woman in higher house. This was my shrine, my temple, and I watched in horror as my drawers were empty in my closet, blue and reinforced with it. While searching my desk, he came across gold-plated mechanical pencil, my father recognized his own. It had once occupied the same drawers as coins, and I admitted that he has signed a tape, so that I had to stop. He was a big gift. You steal things that you've covered while you take things the original owner isn't capable of appreciating. The pencil had spoken in the epitome of its neglect night off and put it good use. Taking these just borrow them after one hour. I'd planned out my journey once I ran out of bed, but it was a big deal. The moment my father and his pencil were reunited at the theme crime suspect, colliding convicted on certain stage of evidence. There was nothing I can say to you, the crime. The boss liquid convicted of a crime I didn't commit. It was only one thing I could do. The shoe polish was kept in many files and I chose black. The future of his hair always looked perfectly natural. Blue and the breeze created by uncoming trucks as he stood beside the lonesome road, bidding farewell to the town unable to appreciate his unique gifts. My natural hair looked pretty much the same way, but once the polish dry, my hair looks much taller than I would ask him with his capabilities in my investment. I love having worn so well and prompicate as a souvenir after my hair was messy. into a stiff unified mass that covered my head  a helmet. I went to bed and found my sheets and pillows smudged in ruin. My face and arms were bruised looking with everything stained with the rigid, military odor of a popping run. It was no wonder the future took us alone. I liked the sheen and color of my new hair, but found I needed to slick it back in order to maintain a clean forehand. This hair of mine is bulletmen. Perhaps that's what you teach yourself. You could have pounded my head with a golf club and I wouldn't have felt the same. I carried my soil sheets into the woods, knowing that you can hear on out things are going to be different. I had crossed over the edge and there was no turning back. Having changed my identity, my next step was to find the real thing in my name. My mother and sister were fond of saying, the criminal always return. to the scene of the crime. This was a bit of time story where the picked up among the television programs, but I thought it might be worth a try. It was certainly true of whoever was waiting to ask some cows for them again they had no choice. The bathroom is really kept our toilet and even if the criminal had to use their ways they'd still use the junk. The cycling of the Silver Dogs and my father's tours were home for several parking vashes, a pair of coffee and a shake- dice, tight lips, fine. cigarette riders and a deck of playing cards, picturing the sort in a confident limit where nothing but two events. Who? Figuring the fee had good reasons to return for more, my under-tripestank. My father's closet had shuddered, moved her doors, which supported a few of the entire room. I took my place, waiting full hours for my mother and her family shouting. I don't give a tinker's damn what they do on Mount Olympus, and this house, you don't boil a $7 stake. My intuition told me that she was talking to my grandmother. Slamming the door behind her, she can proceed on the edge of her hand and bang. She stared down at her bare feet and then, as if she expected them to apologize for some trouble in this in the past, said, well, what if you got to save yourself? She picked it at her toenail for a moment before crossing the room, in fact a bottle of glossy polish from the top of the dressing. This was a new show. in color of potting. Rather than highlight in the nails, it caused them to disappear and then see how many fresh creating a look of street-mission potting. I'd never understood why anyone bothered me in your town and especially my mother, whose crusty, mischaped and palens, resembled the shattered nugget-sized 3-dows found huddled in bottom bed. She stood before the meaner, shaking a bottle and crowning the society from riddle across the ear. A range into a list. the story of she referred to as the Devil's Stunking Rounds. I watched them as she rummished through her closet, returning with the tall plastic box secured with the sort of latches in my fond and suitcase. I'd been through my father's closet thousands and thousands of runs for never my moderns. If I have something a value this is a last place I'd put it, she'd say. Goddamn, laws don't even want what I've got. My father's closet's often clues to me as in the line. The Devil's Stunking Rounds I enjoyed uncovering what I thought in the secrets but felt at best to honor my mother's privacy. Not out of respect so much as fear, I didn't want any possible hand-cosser, put it later mass in your caring with the notion that this woman is first and foremost my mother. She carried the box to a regressor in unpassed latches, lifting the lid to reveal a pale star-of-home head supporting a sandy blind wing. The hair sculpted into a series in pressing waves. This was a magnificent crown of hair. So perfect it might have been styled by God himself by one of those off days of his human being rather than vengeful. After carefully removing the pins my mother placed the wig upon her head and studied herself in the mirror. She nodded her head this way and that, but the curls defying all laws of nature, held the position. I knew the feelings that my rigid hairstyle was by this time basically cemented. to my scalp. Fumes from the shoe polish will make me nauseous, and I have begun to perspire. The inky sweat running down my forehead and standing was sure. What do you say to that, Missy, my mother asked you so? She applied a coat of lipstick and brought her face close to the mirror, cocking her head and arching her eyebrows in a series of expressions that conveyed everything from heartfelt concern and full-fleddle range. away from the mirror, we introducing herself slowly, is it her reflection where I guess she will meet in her first time? What do you say we paint those toenails, she asks? Now? She answered? Sure, she said, have a seat. Who will take but a minute what's your hurry? Sit down for Christ's sake. Then you get along without you for half an hour, sit. My mother's that an open-age hour of polish. This is a new shade, we call strange chickens. She said, all the girls who just... crazy in that. I watched as she partored her toes and said to work. Pauzing every now and then to regard herself in the mirror. Pretty isn't it she said. You'll probably want to wear it with a sandal. That's what I do. I sandal or an open-toed boot, whatever feels right for you. This is a good color for those quiet times when you're weekend guests and finally passed out and you've got the pop can all for yourself. I'm assuming from the shape of this Head Week. and we'll add a hiking in my right. Now, my mistake. Ever walk over hot colds or in yourself a little extra pocket money? I thought so. Well, you just sit back and relax. I'm not here for judge. She finished her right foot and held it out in the space. The good thing about this collar is that it's forgiving. Little on an ale, little on a toe, or little on the carpet and everybody's having. When the left foot was finished, she caused the polish on her neck. and fashion amount of films. Something so high she could lie in her back without crushing them in. They looked uncomfortable but she seemed used to me. Spreading outer arms and legs closed her eyes and crying, especially coming. The unmade bed, the clothing and empty cigarette packets littered in floor. The room was then called the crime scene. Televised steak out, pented condensed the hours of notting's weight in a single mum. of truth. The detective arrives just in time to overhear the ransom and instructions or watch the jewel thief studied Luke Prince in the bank. I stood for an hour with a head full of soup hours, a fugitive, watching my chatty, hairy, nail-styles have a mother asleep in a way. I waited and waited for something to have eaten itself. After she'd woken and left the room my crap downstairs and washed my hair three times. Taking care. reached the top with common destroy my city and share. At the sound of my father's footsteps coming to the front door, I darted into my bedroom, slapping my face and examining the glow of the darkened window. I wanted to be able to cheat, crash and innocent, when he rounded up the usual suspects, gathering us together when you're done and you're solved the most problem in this real law. Who smeared his shirts and jackets and shoeboxes? I take my seat beside. the same people who are going to write themselves from towns and saying. Do you say nail polish or shoe polish on your suits? Today? No, sorry. I wouldn't know anything about that. David Cederas, that story true detected is in his book, make it. As far as book is, dress your family for the way you can. If we..? Day five play the bad thing! Around five model. So We are women good, So We Are mindful Plaint, Base of Gl distinguished distance Nope. I am going to show you my own animation. I'm going to show you my own animation. Coming up, leading to a car chase, sitting through surveillance. That happens during two days I spend today real, high but high. That's in the minute, probably getting into the National when our program is. Just American Life, my request, each week of course which is a theme, and you'll fly it if you can store it on my own. Please program. detectives, want to be detectives, real detectives, and different communities. Action. You can see that. , a recorder is in stress throughout on the story with the frequency that it is. So I'm just going to make a front that when I have the chance to go out with a real life of life, this is what I expect. I expected that. Contrary to what we sent. The... with his real detective work system to turn that into me. , mundane, though long hours, not terribly glamorous. And in fact, the first day I spent Jonathan Muffin, Tower Investigation, I was not disappointed. When I arrived to this office, he was the state, that was the work of the state in the office, meaning, having up statements from witnesses, then. OK, so we master the black man. I had a green light, so unless you're an witness and you're a green light, correct. Investigate. Do  how fast the fire engine is trapped? Witness, oh God, I have no idea. It was 40 miles or maybe more. Investigate. Okay, do  how fast the black dude was trapped? Not exactly the black man lost. Later, we'd provide for an accident, the Jonathan to pictures and work for witnesses, but infinite and useful, which was The dance pricing mode is the accident happened six weeks before. Awesome, down from the middle of the court house to unback ground checks and you can see them. Found it says he wasn't one of his kids who read technical books, stories that G-Man dreamed of being right back. I find generally those people who really, when they're only disappointed what the profession really entails. It's a lot more work, it's a lot less exciting as it's for sure. The fact that John had to think that didn't have to go to the platform, the spot was a warrior, and from the time John had seen this 19th, he got first dad, he chose to use his evidence, track people down so they could serve legal prisons. From there it wasn't much of a leap, so we had jobs in the game. Now he's 29, just so we're gonna black-toe shirt-in-shines, his hair starting to tan that just long enough people into a bit of home-cale. The steady supply of new-pot rights and diet should pop. and unlock the hard boiled detectors of the Sun and the movies. Dr. Rosyberg is strikingly unsinnable. The main impression that you get in the medium is a decent, rough heavy-gile, some pop-straight, treat you to it. It's an impression that comes in handy. Dr. Rosyberg is a very good singer. Dr. Rosyberg is a very good singer. The first thing you have to do, before you go on surveillance, done. This will help you, Gaskin. You don't know how far you can have to drive, can. About 40% of Jonathan's business is surveillance work. In domestic cases, we can get spouses or sheen running. The rest of his work with accident investigations, packing people down, serving the legal papers, and then various insurance and employment fraud cases. Today's client is husband who's become s- and this link put up $50 an hour and plus expense to have a problem and hours paid up fine. She's going out of eye, but excuses to spend some time. She's out on weekends, she's really on weekends. She started dressing a little bit more sexier you could say to you, which is going to work. Now that that's usually seen, we'll also have to start losing weight in a way called longer. So we're working out a lot. what I mean? Today she's supposed to be going out everywhere for the girlfriends from the job. We're going to wait for the store where she works. I'm telling you. See if that's what she thinks. It's what we're going to do when I first get there, so we're going to look through the viewpoints. And be trying to be trying to be trying to be trying to try to. And if you give your pictures in the viewpoints, you can see that. Yes, I have a point for this here. I have to admit that. When I saw the photo, I was completely. for somehow based on I guess a thousand different stories I had assumed that these would be middle-aged people , mature people in a marriage that had gone stale of years but the woman in this photo was 25 years old meaning they have suburban girl on vacation and Disney and other things  that and suddenly it hit me looking at this picture a human tragedy of what was about If she were cheating on a husband and we called him, one way or another, her life is back to turn completely upside down, starting to notice. Okay, now the true curse looking for the deal. We circle the story where she works and we find her car is laying up, it's up back. But finding out where we should go turns out to be surprising you tricking. You can't just park in the app, it's just six. So we have to park in one end of the album, but then witcher, we choose... the sound that you drive, the noise you can use us, and then this is the fact that we need to see for our whatever it is in us. Fortunately, the client chooses that moment. It's probably not going to be set for a song. Okay, so here's the... So probably the softest moment. All right, sir. We find one position, but then a truckbox, we move two more times. Who? ever thought that this would be this complicated. Also, it's boring. I smoke one of Jonathan's new quote-blites simply to stay away. Jonathan watches him as we're removed for the woman. He takes notes on the case. I take notes on him. And sitting in a car  this, in a way, it's just  you've seen in those, , there's cop, buddy movies. You really start to talk about you.. I  the one. I don't know. I  the yellow machine on the screen. That's why. The one here that's special is the six little spiel, the piling, right? It's all heard. The real piling, the story was really, really, the piling, the mac and the z-axon. This sounds really, really, really. So , the Cog Big Mac and France? No. You see, really? I love it, man. Royale, cheese, and food in the order room, this is the food in the wash. Or was it? This is a quarter half. This is a quiet place that I thought was something that's not in this place. Ha ha, I hear power passes. And nothing at all. Someone who might have been there, comes out, smother cigarette, goes back. Later, comes out again, goes back in. If this woman was having a fair, she was in no hurry to get in the fair. What? Possibly, the woman who we were waiting for it, well, long ago through the front door of the shop which we cannot see. To make finally, after all the boredom, something happens. Better be a cold drink. And those who are in the misery. We spin around the power for a and we cover 15 minutes. Often we are driving directly behind. Sometimes, nearly deserted streets and still. He does not seem to notice. It's Jonathan says it's technical. And if this sounds incredible to you, okay, try it this test. You are carrying the sound of my voice in an automobile right now. Let me ask you not to. We'll be reviewing you. Let me just ask you. What kind of cars are hiding? And how long has it been there? No one is interested in this. Hello? Michael? Senator Arlicioustinglyn? Evan? ие he might as this Sement ständist Thermal Sement It's just a year old boss I'm gonna introduce her to her. She's gonna know. Finally she goes into a strict mom. She parks, and parks. Down the way. Jonathan opens up a map so we don't look so suspicious sitting there though of course. With cameras and tape recordings, we are the most suspicious looking car imaginable. Then he goes up not to a movie, helps the whole effect. And sitting there suddenly I realized, I have no idea what is attacking her. The woman is sitting in front of a school  the same kind of store she works for. So, perhaps I think, perhaps it is possible she is going to be in the fairs. She knows who you are. On the other hand, all the women back at her job left separately in separate cars, at separate times. So, could they really be going out together? Why will we at this street mall? Where will we hit it next? In most jobs,  pretty much what is going to happen? you arrive at work that night. And it occurred to me at that moment that for Jonathan. That is simply not true. You gotta tell you what comes from a stressed and kind of tears to the sick. Well, , this is just a good word. , you think it's really glamorous or a computer sting, you just see it on TV. And for these really funny things, guys, it's kind of boring. But now I'm out with you and I think, I'm wrong. It is actually pretty interesting. It is, but I mean, when you're saying that you're comparing. it's a bit  a sign on a sand, it really doesn't compare the wall, they kind of soak in and at that moment we call it what if I want to pull out and be pursue. And then she does something kind of strange actually, she pulls into an album and she waits. She wants to break on the album and it's sort of a mess. We can't follow her without noticing, so we circle the block, she backs up, then drives back in here, then she's... and finally we saw the mystery of what she's doing. Jonathan trained the technique of this one figure is the sound. She is not on us. She's been going parking space. She gets out of the car and it's a door best shot. You take, you take beard, cheap, family style restaurant. You see I don't think I don't think you're something wrong. I tell you why. Because if you have any interference, you need not go to this particular restaurant. This is not romantic enough. If you are out, you are  sex with somebody. you got a couple hours. No. You're not doing this here. This is this. But, look at another way. Maybe she gives them to you, right? Pickle. , it's a snack. I think you keep just going back and forth, whether I think it's just seeing something. You're doing that too, or you... Well, no, I'm just... You're new. I'm just trying to find out the... I'm just... I know Bassi, you want me to know the dirty foot? Yes, he must be known as shampoo. Yes, he must be known as shampoo. I don't know either. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. I know the answers inside. So I start dressing. Right. I'm just walking inside. I'm talking with the answer. And so we head into the restaurant. Jonathan uses cameras and his notes and cards. That is my tape recorder. Done. It says we do two things stick with us. That stuff. And when we walk in, we're pretty much convinced that she is meeting go up on some work. Just  she's got a husband. So we're going in. And we spot it right away in a booth with a man. Me? The way the restaurant is laid out, we can sit at the bar, we go back to the pub, and then watch everything they do in this big play class mirror, that's behind the bar. They don't serve them, cherry diet, coconut sparr, such on it in order to regular diet. Emiensin' is recommend all those things. Chanken! gives him the most disrespect to a pirate. Apparently, he was suspicious. He has been getting to Angler, which Jonathan says is unusual. For some reason, man in the situation when he gets to the seams usually a quad, lean and getting. He jumped. I watched a couple of him here. She's telling the guy a story. Just doing what he cares. Blapse. I think... I don't know what to say. I watch. Some day that woman is going to look back in the sky. Which I think, so when I drove to the restaurant when I was driving there, how's me going? When we sat talking, we were being watched. And I didn't know. So try to picture it, put it together in her mind. Where was it? Where did he weigh? Where did he send it? Where did he seared deep? In the Mirror Jonathan and I brought someone to get a collar to sell your thumb. She kind of goes back to the mansion's bed and you throw us into the top of the front of the window. Is that her? Is it a seat? Is it a seat? Messing with her, She talks and hangs up 30 seconds later Jonathan self-hummed He was him He was messing with her He's  so you got with the girls huh? Where are you guys? Yeah, who's there? What are you guys talking about? That mine bitch Some reason it's hard, it's fun, you understand? Practitary about the strangest thing that this entire scene And that is that there's no six-five between these two people The fact I mean is he's shoveling food in his mouth with a kind of circular motion of his hand that is  the least sexy thing possible It's It's just it's cool. You watch him and you think, she is not going to get this game. If you're going to eat  that. And in fact, when they come out of the restaurant, they go to separate ways. We've had even a kiss without a hug. Jonathan says, she's just going to eat you. She's going to eat you. We call it the guy home. It is lessons  numbers. It's grass. It's an unusual case because 90% of the time Jonathan says, and somebody suspects the spouse of having him fair. The detective catches them in first time out. This case is not very sure that it's going on. He follows the woman for five more days over a thousand dollars worth of surveillance for finally, catches her actually going home with the guy. In the car, later, I asked him to just drive everything to creeps. Clown people around, seek as they watch him. His body kişnily punishes. I unreacted. Please Catch with this, and I'll be removertized. Now go ahead. for months. Fudgrapin' and idiotic, , cattle and getments, probably destroyed an edge. Well, that's always absurd. You never really want to see that happen before. But, no. It came to be that way. It didn't. It was through no fault with my own. These people made their decision to do, for partaking more of the epivisations to partake. And after that we have to be in faith or to each other, maybe they really should be married. Instead of saying, it's better to find out more than you were. I should be home on the whole different path. And so I'll be home later on. Thank you. Well, if you're too far, see the voice? That is actually a newly read. He's from Mary, probably eight months. And he says, yes, having this job has a package here, Mary. , how can it not be more careful about it because you see it. That's the real reason that you're a little bit more. You were sick when we were inside that you guys jumped bad at it. Yeah, yeah, we were doing it. Yeah, I'll pay a special. I'll time you get to be home. Well, I'm not gonna tell you, I gotta go meet my boyfriend. You're , alright, that's right. I'll find it out in this. , I know what anyways, I know what you'd probably. I have in Surveillance for a tail-iron, right there. I mean, anyone's. We have a really good relationship. That's for me. To the next few days after this challenge, I had this experience I've never had in my life. I was completely suspicious of everyone. I'm just a bit suspicious of everyone. And one point I was waiting for somebody outside and found. And a guy in a black gorilla just hares into the parking lot. I kind of, he goes around the curve, cools into a space. And I don't know why I thought I'd go through. I better start taking notes. I have great, great here. Man more sunglasses has crew type lab music where some car jumps out and people are guy gives me suspicious work. I give him suspicious work. And then I blow her on the notes I have the slice and it's quite nice. Just in case. He's gone and he's done. And  a hero he looks in trouble. That's why the hero is double. Miss the kiss kiss band. It's warm and just... And he can slow the light back in the dark. But General Mutt is a killer. Miss the kiss kiss band.
