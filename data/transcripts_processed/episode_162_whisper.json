Part of it says it's the actual work of the industry, and the public was that every day, who's entering all of these other people's lives, and even knew where he'd end up. So personal somehow, especially when the people hired me was to pack everything forth. I mean, you were coming in at a special kind of time for people where they were present. You got to see a lot, very fast. Yeah. Nine of the luggage boards you're bringing all these power boxes, straps you're bringing into so many houses, putting in a possible thing  a very good look around there. Light. You get a very good idea very good idea. It's  being a spy. It felt a lot  being a spy. When you're moving a lot all the time, is the thing that occurs to you how similar people's lives are or have different means to survive. Well, most things that people move are pretty much the name. Everybody has a vet and some, or at least in this part of the country. Everybody has a vet and some books and a lot of kitchenware and generally a couch and a few other things. Everyone tends to have a stereo over in 10-toe television. And then somebody will stand up for one reason or they'll have a lot of music  a lot of CD's or they'll have a collection of wine, or something that will have to go but they don't. There's not that much of a diff. what reminds me of is,  when you're reading in the people where Osmag is in or any magazine. in any setting where you sit inside the living rooms of the super ranch and the super thin mess. And if  usually when I see that I just think  that's it. that's what they've got. There's a coffee table and a couple of chairs and a couch and a lamp  that's the best you can do. that's it. But yeah, you just you'd be moving a couch and it didn't matter if you were sometimes. Again, very rich people. There's only so many configurations for things  couches. One of the moments that was always kind of interesting is that when people stuff was all loaded into the trap, everything they accumulated in this world, stepped into this tiny space. It's a humbling thing for a person. It's a humbling thing and they were good. They were good, very upset, often, and they would be very unsetable by that. And I could sort of understand. because  everything in a sense, everything in the work barns decided to find you. It was now sitting as truck. And generally  they were around, they look at us. We just, , farmers there are wearing a gun launch now. Because you think, well, that's fine. But they would be staring at the truck and you'd say, yeah, we're going to get launched and they'll see you in the river and on the same line. Eight months of good. And you look at them and they pause and they'll do this sort of song. So... I'm not going to be , but you will come there on give. And yes, they would say those words. Oh, sure. People said that all the time. Or they say, can I ride with you? But where are you going to have lunch or do you have to have lunch? I'm there point of view  what was making them? what's making them eat or at the truck? Well, I do think it's the anchor. I mean, it is the anchor of home. I mean, even for those few hours, especially for people, I don't know, middle class people of all, they have some, or how at home, you're sending sort of writer. And I've seen a lot of that where people are just standing around, they don't know what to do with themselves. We come into this world with nothing, we give it nothing. and on living day we have nothing. It's an ugly naked moment that day on which we make a transition from our old life and our old location to our new life and our new place. Which is just one reason why everybody beats me. It's free. It's free to go to something new. It's free to leave any place we need to go to a while. And act to moving itself. It's a hardship. Today and our program will bring you three stories of people who did not want to move. And all. but circumstance forced their hands. And act one, and act that we call seating in mommy and daddy's room. Family finds a way to move without moving. That's to be moving back into the house with the wife and the family grew up. And act two, deal with the lifetime. Woman buys a house from a man who simply does not move out. Ever, and act three, to a de-lux apartment in the sky high. A man makes a move, but it takes an eight years to do it. road, you hanging or rock at the town. We Sodom collected around the classic Alc mettre St. Butner, you have to ask for his max on. What's good. What's it? What's it? яют De Xigrebuz?! and it has to get smooth all in pursuit not making me smooth. It's using brick muscles. I went to Wiseta Minnesota to meet me in New Bend, and watched three men move the child at home. Wiseta is just west of Minneapolis. It's a well-consumber, hedges, and horse-dables. And as I drive over to Memes, I have a hard time imagining that any of the houses I'm passing can be uprooted. There's sewn into groomed lawns, penned in by giant trees. So I'm startled when I near the top of a hill, and seen enormous pink brick house in the middle of a pasture. Clearly on its way somewhere. And though it's suspended 12 feet above the ground, checked up on meals, there are still flowers in the fixtures next to the front door. I mean, it's a really strange sensation to see a house being supported  this. This is meaning. I mean, it looks fragile in a way to be up in the air. And to me, because of a house has personality, it looks, well, lonely and confused. I mean, it's in the middle of, of not where it's not where it should be. I keep thinking, I keep thinking. adding personality thinking it must just wonder what the world are you guys doing to me. But the long run it'll be thankful I hope. It's early in the day, just past 9 and Mimi's carrying bakery box time and red ribbon. The movers take a break, eat a donut, and house looming over us. I chat with Larry. That's a real. We're 40 feet wide. Mean part of the house is 60 feet long. Then on one end has a sunroom that stands another 15 feet. and on the back end mud room so called, and that sticks out 24 feet. And how much did the house weigh? We weigh 240 tons here. This house is NASA by moving standards. Most houses weigh only 100, maybe 130 tons, Larry tells me. The movers finish up breakfast, slip the doughnut box onto a steel beam underneath the front steps, and as they're inches begin to wear, he tells me the history of the house, which is stranger than you might. think. Mimi's parents first built this house and so they know an eye. They lived there for several years and then the father was transferred to Minneapolis. The family bought some land in Wiesetta and decided to replicate the Illinois house exactly. I mean it's amazing. There's same, I was the same wallpaper in my bedroom, same wallpaper in the kitchen and I mean everything was the same, the colors, the carpeting, the paint, the Mason really silly but we only had the house for five years. and we loved it so much. And so, in neighbors from Illinois would come visit us, it said it was just the honest thing because you thought  you could walk out the door and walk home. It was identical. So it really was  walking into the same home. The same crew moved us into this house and they stood at the front door and said, you got to be kidding. This is Mimi's mother, Adrian. Okay, guys, that bedroom goes up on the right. The living room goes over, that goes in the living room over here at the new house. in it was identical and luckily we were able to be produced everything. The wallpaper breaks the carpeting and just put everything. And they lived happily ever after for 25 years and late. Until certain small things began to bother them. Little things about certain rooms. It's as if the house they were living and began to coax us in their minds with a second house. An imaginary house. that was just slightly more perfect than when they actually inhabit. And at some point, they decided they wanted to live in that other house. Here's Chuck, Mimi's father. And we really said the architect, we've lived in the family room for two houses I spoke a total of 30 years. And if this family room was just a few inches or feet or something different or the fireplace is settled with laughter, writers, I'm going to be that it would be perfect. But they found it would be more expensive to renovate. then to tear the house down and build another brand new. What to do? That thought of bulldozing house was so upsetting that they could hardly talk about it. Mimi's mother, Adrian. Mimi had the fourth grandchild, and he was working with grandchild. And all the others had a really neat experience we think with us in that house on that location, and I really felt badly that 80 would never have an opportunity to know that house. I mean,  everybody else. In this case, we're going to need to have really all the house to in this so we can see how much is in your home actually lose it. Then Mimi's husband suggested that the family moved the house. At he and Mimi in their children. of it. Since the structure was too big to take on county roads, they would tug it on to an empty field else around the property. Just to find it and walk away from the original site. The site on which Mimi's parents will rebuild their old house with subtle changes, this fall. What about a house could mean so much to a family? And so much that they build with three times. Scoop it off the ground, crop it on trailers, dry it through the pasture, carry it with them wherever they go. Architecturally, there isn't anything extraordinary about the house. Adrian and truck found the floor plan in a magazine. It's a pretty true story, with four bedrooms, a little formal looking. If, in the 1970s, who spent any time in a country club server, you drove your station wagon past a lot of houses  this. Adrian offers one explanation or a test. to the house. I don't  to change and I'm tedious to the point of correcting a band tedious. But when we come to conclusion on something we are so married to that idea and then we don't want to revisit it again. So yeah people thought we were constrained because lots of friends of ours have been had the ability and the inclination to completely redecorate and recarp it and do all this thing about every 10 years. We don't feel I need to do that and I don't know if it's laziness. I think it's really happy with me. And at some level, the reason this family keeps remaking the same house is simple as they're happy together in that home. They have fun there. This is not a family, and some day dinner together is an obligation. They  being together, and they  being together around their house. When I suggest to me that for many people, moving back into a child. and how it might be painful, bittersweet. It's almost  she doesn't understand what I mean. Well, maybe if someone had died there, she says. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. And there's one more reason why the house needs so much. And the movie of the families , and the scene where the dying men says, Rose Bud. The name Mimi's family, say, is. Hi, Croft. Hi, Croft. Hi, Croft. Hi, Croft. Hi, Croft. Hi, Croft. There's included some old money minnesota and swore in the store calm called, well, high croft, of 40,000 square foot mansion on Lake Minotongka. Truck pages through a green mother album showing me photographs. The house had its own power plant, a commercial on-prem first floor. It was torn down in the 1950s, the land sold off in the by the love of the separate plots, just four miles from rent and family lives now. Everyone makes sure that I know about high croft. Brings it up early in the conversation. The family clearly tells the story, explains something about them. For the last night, in early January, 1952, Granddad was living for the train station. And the staff of Hycroft, and it is the enormous big house, when the journey more than one button, and one button upstairs, and it's downstairs, and then the manager of the house, and everybody else, and show for it. They lined up to see the background. And I will never ever forget how broken up I was to watch this old man who was 85 years old, say goodbye to what was his history. You grow up hearing your family's stories. This is Mimi and they're all passed on. , stories take on life that they're on. This always means stories and it probably makes this high crop toss even grander than it. I don't know, but I think it's kind of weird that they didn't think of a way to save it. So maybe that's  a little voice back in my head that's pretty hard to lose something he's gone forever. There was a choice about my job and the family leaves it shows wrong and this seems to be more painful than the absence of self. And what they fear is forgetting. Amy tells me that one something is gone, it's hard to remember it again. That already is hard to imagine a big peak for a household site. And building the same thing every time is way of guarding against her head. It's almost as if the family thinks that they live their lives into different rooms. All of their memories disappear. There's not one single aspect of that host that is that's important to me, but it's what happened in the house. which is why we brought him built twice. I think it works well, yes. But it's the things that happen there. The milestones in our lives, the preparations for two weddings. The children being born, the baptism, the lunches, the Easter, the Christmases, those are the things that really, if we were in a different house altogether, that would all be lost. Why shouldn't you be able to hold on to what happens inside of room? Mimi's family simply did some extreme feeling. A lot of people have that home safe lift and they'll do a-fraud. A house can inspire a kind of longing. But you can mother house maybe too much, which was something Mimi had to be about. Because she was essentially asking her husband, Mark, to move into her child's home, from his child's home, which is where they were now. Mimi and I drive out to Maple Plain. It's only 15 minutes from Waysetta, but more rural and more working-class. Low-sung warehouses, a beer distributor, a sign that says, Chainsaw Sale on now. We passed Mark's parents' house, the one he actually grew up in. Take a left, and we're at Mark and Mimi's house. High in the bluff, looking around at miles of pretty planes and wetlands. I'm here we can see where Mark's sister lives. She and the rest of his family helped remove this house here. Put down the driveway, plant the grass. Mark's so easy going that if he's upset about leaving the squirrel, he's put so much effort into constructing. There's no way to tell. Mimi was very open minded to move out here with me. Way and civilization. Into moving my palm and head my look to it. Easy! Bend your hand Go to gym. Up. Up. Go. Aw gider. And now, in the least I can do, was cheerfully follow her to our next step. This is as much as I can ever get marked to save up in the end. As the three of us talk, he seems reluctant to bring up anything that might have said to anyone. He says he's looking forward to being in a better school this close to the restaurants to setting up his music studio. But me, me, notice is something he's living out. You never want to mention him up. how you feel about the hook. GO! But you've done everything else yet. -oh. We're going to put the house up the scale. It's not that big. I mean how do you talk about the house? Not just moving, but I love it. I don't think that's easy. I  this house where we are now. This other was better. This isn't the answer means looking forward. And they go around on this. And so finally, when you point out that Mark would have been happy to stand the current house. In this way, I've always been touchy issue. This has never my host for my life. And I always was looking to the next step. And moving here was always to me coming into your world. For a lot of reasons, I mean, this is where Mark had his single life. This is the remark that a people, this is where this is all families involved. This is always been our host, but it's Mark's house. And then I'm kind of making it so  it's black and white, I will be really sad that I can do it too. But I'm so excited. I can be other. And I've always been dreaming about the next step where Mark saw his dreams for this place. And so that's hard. , I mean, he's got paths that he made for the kids to walk. Oh, that's hard to put. So. Mimi starts to cry and I turn off the tape recorder. And she looks up at when they want to say it's hard to see somebody. dreams not be able to happen. There are two parts to them. What you take with you and what you leave behind. And the hardest thing for Marcus comes into me as well. It's what he's keeping up. It's hard to imagine moving an entire house and not many people do it. There aren't firm figures, but by one estimate, 10,000 structures of all kinds are moved each year. The guy moving Mimi's house, Larry stops with steps building movers. Recently made the Guinness Book of World Records and moved the Shoebert Theater in Minneapolis. To move Mimi's childhood home, Larry started by digging a moped around the house, and started to Jackson be at the building, practised off its foundation, pumped it up into the air. Any stuck-up complicated network of support beams in the old valley. underneath. It took less than a week to pull the house close to its new site. Then Mark and his father got an excavator's in dog of a call, graded in incline down into it. The house gets rolled into the hole, the foundation is built under it, the support system is taken away. As they pull the house into the hole, you can see the wheels turning under it, but as progress is so incremental, so graceful that you can't actually perceive them. Unless you go away for an hour and repeat. turned as Mimi and I do, to see the house turned at an angle round in the bend, the donut box from this morning still sitting upon being. Mimi gets out of self-law and call sprints of family, tells him to come over. It looks  today's the day Mary's going to finish, fix the house in the final spot. I climb up in a truck cabin and move her name Dave, who's winging a cable attached to the house around the giant school. Well, it's your damn Initially he reset, no ease at all. You might be done. It might be here. What we're both letting our cables down. And all of a sudden it's in place. And we're not on the job site. It's exactly what we're doing. But in a front yard, you need to be in the right yard. You need to be in the right yard. Right where the circular drive went. Holding your granddaughter. Eating. Just a little more. She's all about the sudden matter. I'll be the more close. Now it's just generating some more. It is longer. Yeah. It is that same pot pot anymore. It's very much longer than the two bowls. It's in a new spot. It is. You're re-wocketed. It's kind of a mess, but... And a lot from 20 years ago that this is the kitchen. Mimi and I climb up a ladder and throw a hole hooked into the floor from the mushroom. I feel as if we're entering an exhibit, something mount, museum, the interior of the house is so vintage 70s that it's a little spooky. I have expect one of the girls from the movie, the Virgin Suicide, to lean over the band store in a gauzy prom dress. We send in the woodpen family room, talking about... means plans to redecorate and her memories embrace. This is the room where the picture was taken in the mark that was supposed to be the cumabrum of a mama and took pictures in here as one morning. But this is the room that for me is caused most agonizing of a automated special and us new feel that not to do. To Mimi, this is the central tension project. She's trying to preserve something but change it at the same time. the tour of the first floor and head up stairs. Well, if  when you walk up the stairs and you're asking me to sort of know exactly how long it's going to take and so if I mean to you that feeling  I'm walking, so the funny is I always walk up and go the spec, so I'll never, I never, ever would take somebody to master better than first because I've never done that. Which I guess I'm about well, I'll tell my level. Anyway, this is my brother who might as well as his bathroom is shared growing up. I try to figure out a polite way to ask me me. Want to be a little odd to be sleeping with you. husband, your parents bedroom? When I finally do, Mimi surprisingly on Facebook mission. It simply doesn't bother that much. In fact, she said, she and Mark have a report posted bed just  parents. Mark comes inside with E.E. and Mimi takes into the seat of you from the kitchen. It's the moment and move when house officially changes hands. And the new owners walk her out whispering, the story. And what's amazing is that Mimi can actually have this experience in this house. He's at the olun. fact that she lived here for 18 years. She torsed the rooms to be a little reassurance that it will feel normal, that it wasn't a mistake to move the house. On what's most comforting to do, is that it feels locked  what it was. It doesn't feel looking at the windows, it was slow it sounded  it's Stingil. I still  it. Did you face the same direction and you're looking at the same green and the shape trees in the back? Later on the evening, I sit in the yard and think about how F Scott would share out the short stories here. And the wealthy corners of Minnesota, amidst lake houses and broad the stormy knees to add told me about his grandfather. last night at high cost, has a plot that's pure for its Gerald. Someone writing way I'm snowy night in a woman car. Taking a last look at the final mansion, they're receiving past. In an actual material story, say Winter Dreams, that has to be lost forever, and at some point in protecting us, and that one, a minister to golf petty, would realize in a panic, trying to conjure it up again. We can have it that world. And be devs. devise an authority to summon it back. But Fitzgerald would have had to write Mimi's story as fairy tale. She's done nothing with some possible, packed the one that we can't take with you. She's kept the past accessible, vertical, family. They have all of the rooms, all of the years with her lives. They can literally step back into something a lot of people strange in that short. And she's been able to do this because I  Fitzgerald's characters. I  so many of us. She's never... laptop. System. Coming up, how to sell your home, thousands, thousands of thousands of dollars, you never move out. I'm trying to keep studying. Let's limit it. Public area international. They are perfect. Hmm This is American live from our class. Each is going to program with course which is a theme in this variety different stories on that theme. It is program how to move that remaining in space between the three to not want change in class but that events force them to change and how they try to hold onto what they already know and love despite that we have arrived at a two-hour program at two deal of a lifetime. The typical way that it goes when somebody knows is that they move into the new class record and the old activities. out. Sarah Cannon has this story of situation where the new move removed in, but at that point the process was called. My steps is to ruin one to the house and set Carber New York badly. But the former fishing village is now the artiest of the tourist towns that make up the Hampton's, and she couldn't really afford it. Then one day she found out about a lovely house on Mainstreet, listed for two prices. The more expensive listing included a house, a shed, and a little garden. The cheaper listing included a house. a shed, a little garden, and net. Well, the way I identify net is my man. People haven't this, but he really is mine. These are the man that came with the house. The deal was this. Rume moved into her dream house at $110,000 discount. The catch was net, an elderly sick man who sold the house cheap. on one condition that he never happened to move out. Rul is in the upstairs apartment, that lives in the most spacious downstairs where he will stay until he dies. While that is working in his little downtown shop which sells classical music CDs, Rul gives us a tour. So, Ned's portion of the house, which is where he's lived for, I think, 20, maybe 20 years or not, and which is good for him. because, , he's older, it's all in street level, he doesn't climb any stairs, and also he's lost a lot of his sight, which is one reason why we really didn't want to leave this house. Unlike the mansion's across the street, this house isn't big and fancy. It was built perhaps a hundred years ago for the workers in the local watch case factory. When she bought it, Rue was 36 in single. The idea that she couldn't have it only two rooms at the new house, didn't seem problematic. What she did not first. was in the space of the year she would acquire a puppy, a husband, and a baby. She tries to focus on the deal's advantages. The cramped quarters have taught her to resolve fights with him husband rather than sleeve them, she sells. And, Rue, extravagantly messy and review, has now taken to watching Marcus Stewart's TV show at 9am, and has learned helpful tips for maximizing space. Still, she can't deny that the population-gooing her apartment has made Ned's downstairs especially attractive. This is the limit. Is this where you would have the better with you? Would you use that as the master bedroom? , well actually, I feel  I would change the whole back of the house. If I were down here, as you might guess, I've had a few imaginings of what I'd  to do with it. Space down here, but not too many. I don't  to get carried away with myself in that print room. I don't know. Why are they terrible fixed thing? Well, I don't know. I mean, there's just a kind of a... There's this vulture  aspect of it. When you start talking about what you'd  to do, I mean, there's no getting around that. When I talk about what I'd  to do, I'd never get to do it until he's moved on from this world. Well, we are now standing in the second pop. of his house on Main Street and Side Harbor. And I live here since 1898, I sold it to Rue, thank you, in 95. And I never expected to be a lot, it's a lot for Rue. To Ned, he was 78. Selling his house from under himself was an ingenious way to stay in a place he considers her. A piano. as to maybe his living as an editor. Med has spent his life getting money and then spending it all. By the time you put his house on the market, he was sick and broke. He didn't have the will to move. The main street house is the only one he has ever owned. It's crammed with antiques, and oriental ruts, and reminders of his elegant and warm-suffering. A large romantic portrait of him from 1951 hangs in the parlour. In the kitchen is a framed photograph of still wood, his grandmother's plantation holes. And the little silver coffee set is set right here. A little coffee pot, cream filter, and a sugar pitcher. Very good. My mother set was from the Civil War. Your organization buried in the garden to keep general Butler spoon back in the garden, to keep it from them. And I said, oh mother, on the bottom of each piece here, it says 1893. and she said, well, that's a stock number. The reality, my mother was not to be moved by this. And when I took the tray to a silversmith and knew we ought to have it read, he said, has this tray ever been buried in the ground? Because there are also other minerals in it that you only find in the ground. I said, I told him the story, several of it, but I was right. Besides the house and its occasional ailments, a leaky skylight and overflowing garbage can, what unites these two households is the anticipation of Ned's death. Back when they first negotiated a deal, nobody thought he would still be alive today. He had had a heart attack and he had had a history of heart disease, I don't know how long in history. He had had bypass surgery and then right after the closing. two weeks after the closing he had another heart attack and I talked to him in the hospital and he sounded quite authentically sick I actually said and that was that was six years ago the trouble is I thought of a sudden again to get better and was going around so and I yo I feel perfectly good I loved them I'm now wake up and I'm braced the day so I'll speak. Well not early today. The contract that binds Ned and Rue has led them to live together, separate. They don't consider each other's family or even friends. They don't invite each other over the dinner. drop by each other's apartment for a chat. When they do talk, their conversation is almost exclusively about the house. But consider it roommates, they try not to offend each other in their habits. I try to figure out when maybe nobody's upstairs. And that's your mother. But sometimes I realize they are upstairs and I go hit play and eat an apple. I'm sure it must fall. It would fall on me. I've played piano ever since I was nine years old and very very sad I've facted I can no longer read music because that's what got them all those pieces that I've learned all those years ago. But I now can sit down and simply play what comes out and I'll really know sometimes what comes out is very very nice. Thought very sad and oh that been moving even see. I'm telling you. Not a dry handkerchief in my house. In fact, who likes his plane? She's never told him so, but she finds it soothing when the music trips into the bedroom when she and the baby are taking a nap. And he is never told her that he finds her present upstairs comforting. Still, bear a complicated feeling. on both sides. I do  Ned and I do feel  I feel kind of been able to interact with him  he's taking care of him sometimes. He just inspires that and people. But then I'm not going to be terribly terrible as I am. I'm going to be sorry but I'm also going to feel so horrible. And it's it's it's it's very tabloominaries. Every time I ask him how are you doing, I always get this little twinge because it's there's just there as a twinge. I twinge of , oh how are things going or how are you doing and it's just this wicked and I think he looked so cobody and he's sort of guys that I, , a little bit light in here. What's so short of you? Do you think he's keyed into this other conversation? Well, I, as I said, Nensnow Fool. I'm aware that, , that the other side can't be all of us. real that I'm still there. But she's been doing nice to me. And I think I've been doing nice to her. She obviously likes you. But she's also waiting for your demise. Does it make you feel guilty that you got better? Aren't there a girl? Maybe I'm too, . I just saw a little bit of that there's room sitting up this tent, health, but wait, but I'm biting her fingernails for half a minute. And it's often that they won't matter to me, either out, it's clumsy or what room seems about. I don't rain blue or anybody with a back that I don't expect all my mum. And I don't in a way. with the last name for Schesmanker news. Sounds on us, but put this way. And I guess it is. When one gets picking it on the other way, it sounds really vital. As though I'm just squelching the light of a young couple, and now brand new guys. A lot of people would say that real. side of her. She is waiting for a gentleman to fly. That's why I think this constellation is this is a certain substance now. But yes, these thoughts require us every month or 9 swellersions. Your own, dear. I did when I thought I had to do, and I also think that she did which she loved. Maybe not had to, which she did which she loved. To maintain their relationship, netting room have developed a careful communication. The void of jokes about arsenic, for example, at least to each other. The result is a textbook defense of... the most associated. How's found version of Robert's rules of order? It's been very simple on. I think. Ru and Michael liked Rachel. She doesn't inquire into my problem and I don't require humans. We need to carry us into territory that is uncharted and really will always be uncharted. What? The territory that she presents back then. still alive and I resent the fact that she wants me to die. It's supposed to be the total angstate of an examining every practice brain or emotions in what not supposed to advance something but usually the presses rather than advances icing. I don't think that we have these subwoofes of cycling whatnot for kind of good reasons to come. That ought to be on the surface, then not because it's unanswerable, and it's territory that I'm unable to explore, and I don't think we'll be able to explore it, to any benefit. Because of his upbringing, Ned comes to this position natural, but it's remarkable to me that my stepsis, a 70s wild child still known to say things , virtue is a load of crap, has come to understand the power. of the light was straight. In private parts, a waste and milk. She's on a apologetic about what lords me in the relationship. I feel so very guilty of that because I don't feel anything that anybody else wouldn't feel. I know how people are. I know where's the man anybody. There's no person. I mean, , mother Teresa could be living in this apartment if she were young with a baby and a husband and not have those thoughts. Okay? I know that. We seem to me that people waste an awful lot of time. having pretenses about what they're supposed to feel. When what they really feel is what they really feel, why not just, and you can't, you can't tell life to be something I was not going to do, that it isn't. You can't argue with it. I don't mind being  this if you're moving. That's that's fine. Both through a net moved into this house hoping it would be the last place where they'd ever unpack. That got this wish, but if he survived for more than another year, the strong possibility may. Ru will have to move out. Her two small rooms will become too small once her baby starts to fall. For now though, Ru's proud that the five souls living under her roof are getting along so well. And when that finally does die, she says she'll be sad. Along with twinjas of wickedness, it's a sadness she bought along with the house. Hey, my rock mine house, Iris. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'm sorry. Oh. Carr continuing. Just Wisconsin. Loveness, cozy with joy. a darkness, You're not a home. Back three, to a deluxe apartment in the sky. But when the producers of this American life, Blue Shedding, you used to have a job that was all about moving day, and people who did not want to face that day. So, what's my name? agency in New York Project Reachout, part of Goddard Riverside Community Center, that moved homeless, mentally ill people into their own homes, with most of her clients it took years. In April she went back to New York to watch one of the guys who she knew and  finally get into his own room. Back at my old job, George stood out from a lot of the other clients. He was immediately easy to relate to. He was more talkative, more expressive, more open with people. One of my old co-workers. the members being an intern seven years ago, walking into the basement where all the clients were hanging out playing cards, not talking much, especially to him. He remembers meeting George. He was very charming, so the director introduced, was introducing me to the clients, introduced me to George, and George asked if I wanted to play football. And so we played football. And he was very friendly, very engaged with what was going out of his way to make me feel at home as a new intern at the day program. Other clients were capable of that kind of warmth after you knew them for a little while, but very few were so friendly when they started. At that time, George was living on the street. Eight years when five recordings were ready to move into his own place again. What took so long? For one thing,  a lot of mentally ill people, he didn't really mind living outside. Ever since the day he first became homeless two decades ago. And they had this gallop and slept with his clothes, though I'm not sure if they were alive. That's to go off the streets. Now I think about it. Now it's just leaving the way I did, it shows that science is very sick. Man, no plans. Let's just close the block to go right here. This V. That closed, rugs on the floor. I'd burn it down to just left. And you never went back, that's up. No, I never went back. I was three. I felt  I was three, it's burn. I was three, nothing to do. Then, no, no. responsibilities, nothing. And I have to pay rent out big gas light, go over here, eat what I want, what I want, what I want it, go over here and sleep dead. I was flying around  a man and I was so free. Listen to my walk. Do it, do it, do it, do it. Day of would see him in the park, looking is out there as anyone you ever stand in the streets in New York. The white unitar, white shirt, white turban and with gold chains ramps neck. They've been other workers who give him sandwiches, try to lure him back to Project Reach out where he had come for help in the past. It took a long, long time. And, , I kept talking with him in the park. George, come back. We did it before we would be doing it again. Take care of yourself, come back. Dave, say, I'm a little scared, you freak. What life has Lord of just been free? We just asked for it. And what comfort would it sleep at a park, but just hanging out in a so-way? So he took and he said, no, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. We went on  that for a while in the park Then whatever reason George was ready and he decided okay he'll do it when he came back one winter What makes George his case different than a lot of the other people a project reach out is that he happens to respond really well Medication without it. He says he's angry all the time And go that built up  how for it explode all the year do a station blow-in-one. Before my last month, my thoughts were , all over the place. You could ask me a question, then, and when you say, later, I ask you to ask me a question. Now if you ask your question, , I try to answer it, but I have to answer it. , we can sit down and control and concentrate on what's going on. But I was a real crouch. These days, if you meet George, he looks completely normal and great. The smile of all the time, he looks as if he takes time to put himself together every day. Dave says he looks  a college professor. A 48-year-old African-American man with song pepper hair, pressing a nice suits or jackets and looking all studious and eye glasses. And today he's moving, 40-blots-norm, to his own place. Thank you for having me. No. Day helps George move his stuff into a van, along with Christina Kane who coordinates housing for project reach out and moves everyone. Moving a homeless person usually means carrying a few garbage bags and stuff. George and means the van is jam packed. He has a portable stereo, a TV, and a VCR. Things he's brought with disability checks. But the real reason we have to make 7 trips up and down the stairs, 3 people carrying stuff is his clothes. George move. for the last year George has been living in a shelter where he doesn't have his own room. A place designed is transitional housing. At some point all of these clients have to move to permanent homes, and it's one of the trickiest parts of my old job. Moving days with their all working towards, but in many cases, when that day comes, it's been  pulling teeth to get. there. Most kids are pre-nixer this quality with some homeowners. They don't  change. They've barely gotten used to the transitional shelter, and now they have to move. One of the guys I was closest to got so mad at me about moving, that I gave them a little pep talk about it every day for months while he just scowled at me before he agreed to go. He stayed in the shelter for two years. Christina is the one who now finds housing for these guys. Some feel  we don't want them in. more and we want to make room for new people and just get them out and they they have made deep connections with a lot of the workers and they feel hurt when that relationship changes doesn't necessarily end or have to end although some of who do end it there was a client who who did move and he never came back and he won't see me for follow-ups they do feel abandoned and for a lot of these people is their first relationship that was consistent and nonjudgmental. They don't want to lose that. Because of this, during the move, the three of us keep up an ongoing pattern of encouragement and positive reinforcement. The open the door to his new place. This sounds nice. Right. Now, just because of the floor. There's a mission in here. Hey, hey. Look at this clock. The things that are important to, I guess you would say the average person, , having a clean place to stay. I try and stress that, look how clean it is and a lot of them are  so,  they live outside. It's okay if it's not clean to them. So that's a hard selling point to get them out of the shelter. They want them somewhere clean and safe. And to them, clean, come on. and this isn't really a priority. If they feel comfortable, some way, that's the priority. Even though we all know this, in our need to go on and on about how great the new places, at some point we run low on material and find ourselves sane. We're living with that, so please. And as we ride up in the elevator, George Pines brings over him in the shelter. We're a lot of fun, little mom. We're a lot of fun. Yeah, we're a lot of fun. We're a lot of fun. Yeah, it'll take a little while. That's what I listen to. Yeah. , it's a white power, so you call it the first few nights. , it's always difficult to sleep in a... So we have new place, ? That's natural. Yeah. So that's what happens. And, ... Yeah, but that's the actual lightest place that I appreciate it. And then when you go back to this, come to the studio, it's really... Yeah, I gotta get out of here. I don't know. I see it in yellow, well I'm gonna quickly have moon in here. Yeah. looked at the yellow walls, oh, drab, we have a drab. They could tear me out of my eyes. Once people have moved inside, they sometimes really struggle, and it's all a bit unpredictable, who will do well in the wall. One guy we moved took six months to figure out how to ride a simple subway commute back and forth to use a place each day. But George seems happy with his new room, once everything's in it, and the facility is designed for people  him. It's meant to be all. The rent is a fixed percentage of his disability chat about a third. There are staff people there to help him if he needs it, but it's really his own place. Two weeks later I go back to visit George to see how he's doing. He goes back every day to project reach out to visit Dave and get his meds and to go to his day program. I have a council of basic science for six minutes. Six minutes, job for here to reach out. I give up my life, my day, my life is my tea, my hair, my clothes, and I look at the time, I see the trains come, I dressed the elevator, that's how cool it is, I walk real cool, come to the oven, today, then I go to the upstairs, I walk around the corner and I keep the train station and I hear the train coming back and stop, why? is it that today, beware this, shoot me, hot! to let you go to the machine,  on the train, six minutes later, it's called after there, 90-60 of our way to the city. He talks at length about the unlimited metro card pass that he pays for once a month. The pass that lets him ride around the city on the subway and buses as much as he wants, and visit his old buddies in the shelter, which he does nearly every day. The city seems full of possibilities. After we finish talking, George walks me to the bus I'm taking to the airport. He says he's never flown in an airplane anywhere, but now that he knows what bus goes out there, he thinks we'll go out and watch some planes take off some time. He asks me how I'm doing, often Chicago, a whole new city. I tell him things are good in some ways, not so good in others. I tell him I miss him more. He pats me on the arm. He says it takes some time to get used to things. Good evening. Got a move. Got a kid out. Well, I've probably been used today by Susan Burton in myself without its Bloomberg, who's chef and angel is Snyder, deputy editor's author of Jackhead, Marguerac, an Oelie Speaker, Nancy Updick, and Consulieri Sarah Vowl, production up from Todd Botten and the Miltonberg Music Out from John Connors, and Heather McAdams, and the record round-up. production mode. Give it a listen. In our last story today, the story about George, there is this moment in the story where he says, well we're here and sleep dead. I was flying around  a man and I was so free. Listen to what I walked. And producer Bush had been spent a while trying to figure out what song it might be that he seen so she could play it right after. And she came up with many possibilities here just for you. This earth wind and fire has got to get you into my life. Where is it from? Jesus Christ Superstar. Tell me what you think about your friends on the top. Have you had so many garlic funcums? For maybe Christ he's doesn't ask. And of course I find a pick George Clinton.
