A few years back, the Orange Chicago had some unusual weather, and 18 people struck by lightning in one month. 17 of them survived, and I said that to interview as many of them as you talked. Once with the worst injuries, remember nothing happened to them. But the rest, all described, moment they were in, very similar to them. Mike Bruduron, a very Western one, golf course. to other guys and write this. All I saw was just a very bright, white flash. I think I remember a white light. I remember a light in the struck guy, felt my pain, and I remember what I think I remember just and all getting not back with. My brain saying, hey, you got to stand up, and nothing else was really was fine. And I was trying to call friends, and I remember that from the school. And it was , these kind of went slow motion. I would point on my eyes and I would just say, I'm totally kind of falling backward. I can remember some very falling, but it wasn't , some of this trip and falling on the ground was , if you took them one or two minutes before they actually pulled the ground. This is a terror to  me. Pick them say they were surrounded by friends and... and when the both came, there was suddenly a crack in the round bodies. The natural world turned supernatural. Virginia Davies was at a company in it. They just started to drizzle. She never saw the blast. She didn't suspect lightning. She said she thought it was the end of the world. Right before all this happened, it was  everybody just shut the sound. Yeah, you couldn't get enough of it. You couldn't move. It was  total time to round the world. In that area where I was at, then I saw... started hearing , , humming, , these are something. Oh,  a bunch of flies, this is, , and it felt  something was going to happen. I didn't know. Then I looked over and I saw Sylvia screaming and I saw her mouth open, but I couldn't hear her at first. It was  everything was shut up for  if I don't know if it was seconds or minutes or it could have been a sec. And I didn't know where I was at. Actually it was  the moment  in the straw. But in the moment after, the days and weeks after, it all started to be different. When something happens to you that is so...be it. So, it will go. You definitely started to think about why. And most of the survivors I talked to came to the same conclusion. It was not just the coincidence where the light was. My older thing and I'd be bad to ourselves all the little something. This is the 10th floor of the child. That's the 10th floor. God is ten Musons. God is trying to eat ten Musons. He's going to be back. He's going to be there. He did. I go and eat fish and serve the purpose to whatever happens. There's reason behind it. But today in our program we try to go to experiment. Usually we bring you stories of people in the middle of big experiences. We're going to some sort of change. Blow some. at some times that moment dramatic change is only half the storm. The other half happens after time passes and they return to be visit that moment. Today's program is about what they find later and what remains, who would let the ones learn. Our show today in three acts, act one, I used to bang here, but that was a long long ago, which David Rackoff returns to the city he grew up. Time for a present. Pressure. Back to exile of Main Street. The young Russian emigrate returns to the heroes of his youth, grave Soviet dissidents who risked their lives, height and cold war, who were forced out to serve the Union. What have they been doing all these decades? Many dissidents who resettled, comfortable houses, not just in America, the New American suburbs. That great shopping competitor tomorrow. The story of a social experiment involving a superman. market and 6,000 poor people. Stay with us. HECK 1. I used to bank here but that was long long ago. David Rackop recently flew to Toronto where he grew up through a visit of time and his life that for years. He joked about downplayed and he tried not to pick them. That does a story in what he did. At age 22, right in consciousness. It is a problem in traffic cats for a problem. 20s. It is also having terrible. So having terrible impact, but I  to refer to it as the different options. An old Canadian joke bears talent in there. A boss says to an underling, I'm off to Su-Sain Marie for the weekend. Su-Sain Marie is just the annoying ones. But boss, there are only more of some hardworking players that had cancer in her brain, Murrah. Oh, what position does she have? When I joke about harsh kittens being the cancer for boys with her things in half measures, it is invariably to someone who has been for brother or son who's just died in the wronged ones. I don't mean to demigrate other survivors more or less for children of survivors. My inappropriate wise crack will be served to prove a point of our self. On some level, despite the fact that I received both radiation and chemotherapy, I cannot escape the feeling that I was at the best, a cancer tourist. That my survival means I'd have. Kind of in there, sort of under. It has only recently occurred to me that perhaps I might stop quickly insisting that the cancer wasn't me. The doctor's pop me into an easy-back oven, where a forty-one light bulb hold to be tested since it's trapped. What remains some 13 years after the fact? For small tattoos, subject came to black box by combasports for light Norseau. Near total numbness in the very tips of my fingers, as well as a palm size area on my right and your thigh also without feeling. And most last freshmanly three straws of my freak imma. therapists for you, you called storage somewhere in Toronto. millions of tiny Walt Disney's, they wait for us. Until the day when I return and haven't enjoyed with some willing over me, and thereby fulfilled his iconic destiny. Go into children, we'll eventually go on to bring my heart to work. More than it is our... for kids who can be fairly boring and they don't. I just want to know where the sperm is. Easier said than done as it turns out because since that time I have moved my parents who moved the sperm bank has moved and became a crossbow as moved. The traces have been thoroughly kicked over which suits me far. I'm not my nature terrible sentimental or not a photo maker. I've attempted to never move back until now. Along with my scar, my tattoo and my numbness, these straws of sperm are the only things I have left from that time in my life. The period of 18 months that I have generally tried to know what to think about. 13 years later, at the age of 35, it started to seem  bad juju, continued to ignore it. And so I am off to find the straws. Just in time for my pludiness, my crispy permanence. I was treated with EMH, the Pence's Margaret Hospital, main cancer facility in Brunswick. If you were a child at any time from the 1930s through the 1950s, living anywhere in British Empire, chances are you were inundated with images of two young princesses, with the market. Elizabeth would eventually become queen of course, but Margaret was always considered to be somewhat prettier and simply by virtue. of her thwarted ascendancy to the throne, she was less doody bound, and costingly lost her. She could keep on her. As she grew up in half her serial doom romansons, Margaret gave the commonwealth public her taste of the kind of low rent scandal we could later come to expect from her house and wins her. It's not  she was a slacker and an embarrassment. Calling it Princess Margaret Hauss was not  naming it the billing car. It's more affectionate than that, more glamorous. The Trishin Nick Zimmer. hanging on the wall on the way to the radiation room in the old hospital. Was a photograph of Princess Martin's hand taking on the occasion of the inauguration of the building? It was actually an X-ray photograph. So her highness's jewelry gloves white and that's about the vagueness gray as her invisible flat. I look at it every time I go straight to him. The radiation room itself is a lead-lined interior chamber of the hospital. Two red laser beams cross over the exact center of the table where the patient is locked. Using the cross for small black tattoos from the torso, the technicians lie me up to getting me from the thousands of rats ready to eat. The machine is bulbous, huge, and a dull hospital green. The death rate is straight up and 50 psi-5. I  how I can cook up. Above my head, directly at Island, someone has drawn a hastily rendered happenings, magic marker. Underneath that is written the message, give us a smile. Rita Hayworth's future, the grace of the side of the atom bomb he dropped on the Keenie Adolf, there's something so pathetic, so vastly outmatched by the scum of the happenings. It is  putting a garnish on an isolation. I never fail as a smile. Even when I reach the point in the treatments when I was in my hair and swollen out, my throat has been burnt to such extent, I can't out swallow, I smile. They haven't stopped for a happy days either. Every time I'm going to bed door closed, flashing with a booming plane, so to begin music, the same song every turn, the same place, the same song every turn. Full horn section build up the chorus, so... You're just too good to be killed. The plutonium drops down into the San Francisco column. A warm wind starts to blow on my chest, indicating that I'm now getting the equivalent of a lifetime's work the recommended dose of gamma radiation. And I swear. The hardest thing I've sperm with more chemo therapy is fairly standard practice, chemo makes you sterile. They suggest it to most male patients with certain age. It is certainly the most important sperm sample I've ever written but it is not the first. In 1982, as a freshman, I sold it once. Certified mammocream potential for mixing had the following flyer. College man, make money now! It was an advertisement for a mid-town sperm bank. We would be paid cost of $50 to do under somewhat more controlled circumstances, the very thing that was occupying a great deal of our weight in lives anyway. The lab was very interested in our seed. The sperm of the Ivy League. There's something so obscenely vital, so borderline you can check about that image. in the view of a potency and a recon-stallion vision of the future. It was a stereotype much greater than the actual sum of its parts. I can assure you, if you and some of them are called Hebrews, I went to school with myself, and I'm a little crazy. I remember nothing from that day. I cannot tell you if they were dirty magazines, although I suspect they're not remembering in Paris, although I'm sure. and I cannot remember what I was paid, although $40 towering screens about. The conflation of climax and commerce cannot have failed to escape my notice. At age 17 it felt  sexual transgression. I suppose it's still that since until this moment. I have never told anyone about it. It is now a great round-to-day in January of the New Century. The New Prince's Margaret Facility is beautiful, occupying an old art decorating shrines building. It is imposing and great and elegant and graced in the center with a soaring six-story atrium. It is nothing  the old hospital where I was hearing it. I feel of who jealous as I walk in. There's even a multifaceted chapel which I don't recall from the old place. Outside of it. on the whiteboard, someone on staff has written just afar, and then a quote, Joy is not in things. It is in Earth. It is attributed to one Robert Wagner, whose dates are 1813-183. Presumably this is a different Robert Wagner than the Wattel concealing turtle neck-wearing star of the towering inferno and heart to heart. So different a Robert Wagner and faculty, that when I try. looking up in my Bartlett's quotations, he is not listening. Who is listed there, with exactly the same banks however, is Rehear Rock. He of the Colonel Nazi Opera's heroic Uber mentioned. Finally, an after- Bartlett's doesn't list, it's not the caveat against materialism among the composers' notable quotes. But it's a lot more suitable for an oncology chape laughed at all, then, to be German means to carry on matter for its own sake. This new place is completely devoid of anything I might recall. Not a single doctor who treated me still works here. But finally remembered, X-ray photograph of Prince's Markets' hand is also no work to be seen. As volunteered, the desk if I'd rocked here from the old facility. It was on the way to radiation. I was also a radiation patient, chair of bars. I don't remember. I then asked her if she remembers the music during treatment. She doesn't dismiss my recollection, which is not sure if her self-confidence is a long ago. All memories, horrors. Details can change or come this entirely, particularly in moments of physical peril. A kind of amnesia goes hand in hand with sickness and a good thing too. But of these two details, that extra photograph, that new, I am sure. Thank you. It's not all that hard to locate this in the sperm lab. A few phone calls and I find that it has been moved. Locks, stocking, barrels, and other ones that can be located in a hospital. Well, I finally called them up directly to see if there's still a person. pros they know all too well who I am, they have been waiting for me. Or more precisely for my money. There are apparently ears of storage these aren't seven. I owe customers $1,000. What would have happened if I never checked up on this, would it? Would I one day be walking past some pawn shopping to round out? And there in the window next to the watches, the saxophone, the old Canadian Legion corner or more unelected. are three stars of my scene following out in a dusty shaft of summary. The folks at the lab, do me with suspicion, but not because I am an empty lab. What the folks at the lab seem described by is this radio-sign. They don't really understand why I want you to have it. I am reduced to using picky tricks, pre-ambling a drone called by describing myself as having been accused of a patient, which seems a little melodramatic meaning. And leaves them. completely unmoved anyway. Or if I'm not being treated and playing the ridiculous submittal, stammering and apologizing. It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and all to know a fail. What begins is frosty but cordial relations between denourcing manager and myself devolves steadily. I find it's runtime and she refuses to speak with me outright. I am screwed, we visit in Christmas past, walking through a room right now being completely unheard and unable to physically manifest. I will not be able to see the facility towards the vault or wherever it is to keep the straws or ask for my many medical questions. My audience with the sperm of the ideal egg is dinner. I recalled last time I saw these fugitive children crying. It was in summer of 1997. By that time my illness was fairly advanced, I was some 35 pounds under weight and old man at the age of 33. Virtually the last thing I remember was on an isn't. I had been told if I could get the sample downtown to the lab with 45 minutes, I could do the harvest at home. To this end, the lab technician at the sperm bank had given me some sterile containers. When the abstract is out of the farmer comfortable, produce my sample. in the privacy of my childhood bedroom. But privacy isn't really the name of the game when your mother has to drive into the hospital. I've never been licensed by a sitting government to drive a car, and I'm far too weak to take proper transport. By happy coincidence, my mother's office is too blocks away from the hospital. After breakfast, she says to me, you're domestically, I'm going to start the car. Why don't you car upstairs and get ready? I'm free to sleep. weeking her italics, my own. If this breaks her out, she doesn't by home. She's a physician herself, so we might just be gone for the course to tell your youngest child to go upstairs and salute the archbishop and then join you in the car. My deep down, not my final effort after what is arguably been half a lifetime. practice, I've known my coat and grabbed the drawer. It is made of clear icing. In college, my friends parents came to New York for a psycho-allics convention. Getting on to a hotel elevator crowded with their colleagues, my friend turned to his mother and staged whispered, Yokehester, I worked. But it is just me and my mother and car. There are no Freudians to entertain with the discomfort of the alcohol situation. even in my weakened state. I'm certainly not going to ride next to my mother with a transparent mile of spooge in my lap. I look around the kitchen for a suitable bag and find perfect one. It is four by six of my favorite. It has clearly been on the kitchen since I was very young because while I turned it over, I see that it's printed with the image of an orange lumping and black cat and in clipping blood circle. tree. Among my destinations on this trip up to Toronto is the side of the old hospital. I'm told it's being used now as a homeless shelter. It was in one of Toronto's few rabbi Japanese and there were a lot of hookers and also a Christian ministry back when our location. The area has clearly been cleaned up because I don't see any hookers or a breakers channel show her, and The provided homeless people growing into the old princess Margaret all look  backpacking or in Europeans. I stand in the circular driveway, the place where the smoking patients use the congregate where their IV stands and enjoy their last cigarette. I think that's how this used to be my playground. I'm trying to actually feel something about the whole thing as I stand there. I'm not really coming up with anything. The building is possibly one of the more important structures in my life. I feel  I should well up with some sort of nostalgic yearning morning right youth. But it's just not happening, which is very strange. One hour. Once on my way home from radiation, a man came running out of the night to Columbus, Chapping in the house, people. Another man came running after him and  a car came and all came to lies. The man getting chased actually yell, stop, thief. I remember thinking, myself, well that's very cliche. I was close to the robber, I could have stuck my foot out in 15 grabs, but I did. He made it across the street, dodging traffic and was out of sight in the moment. The man from the night of Columbus stood frustrated on the sidewalk as the cars rushed by. He turned and gave me a dirty look for my inaction. I wanted be safe. I wanted to explain how we can turn. at that point. But more than that, how I had essentially let go of any sense of agents in, I could lie on a table and could shoot me from a gamma rays. I would eat what was put in front of me to hair, could fall from my head, I'd probably be burned. But I was not involved. That was a stranger here. But he could even see me standing there seeing vaguely surprising. They say that times of crisis of the true test of one's character, I really wouldn't know since my character took a powder that year, leaving instead a jewel-bright hardness. I would add my very cleverness that year, an airless relentless kind of opening this. Every time the complex human emotion threatened to break the surface of my consciousness, I would have a joke. Come on, give us a smile. I was Thanatos' rodeo crumb. I still am, and eros' as well, as it turns out. Years later, in a tender embrace in bed with my first real boyfriend, he said, My name. Oh, dude. I stopped, sat up, and responded in my best in the evening. Yes! This kind of behavior is actually a joke, things. There was a period during the illness when I was at my very sickest at 115 pounds hovering in and out of consciousness. This month and a half was the one period in my life when I was on the thinking. Where I was at deflecting every emotion in my heartache. But it would take millions of cancer cells. Lining up for their big Esther ruins finale in my link static system for me to find me shut up is sobering Or would be where I think about it which What remains if your past if you didn't allow yourself to see the thing in her If you don't have your experience of the moment. If you glossed over with jokes or zoom past them, you end up with curiously dispassionated feelings, receipts will be populated. It's as if a new from Bombwagon involved your left or the hospital card or rear scanning walls for familiar photographs. Sometimes, in the absence of emotion, your only reclosses to surround yourself with objects, assembled and challenged about them. So I am doing it right to draw to the human for the moment this physical evidence will have the surface proof that the illness was breathing because even now I only have the right timing.

This is Mary, my class. Each week I'll program with course which is theme, bring your variety. This is where I start.

The only frame photo in the higher house was me 12, the tiny old man and everyone assumed in the grandfather who wasn't packed on trace of the inventor of the Soviet hydrochloric law later became a dissonant and winner of no though peace community. And then there was a soundtrack in the trial. I put in my hours wrapped in the doors. One of my parents controlled the tape that we listened to Alexander Gaudy. He'll still be a dissident who sang with great pathos of labor camps. Exitutures. And Exah, Mirgom, Zani, Oyniv, Oyniv, Zopra, Mepsodul, These words were playing in cars and homes all across the subordinates with Soviet dissent land in the 7th. Even now, After the Soviet Union has collapsed and they could go home, Many of the most prominent former dissidents living places  the Reveer massachusetts, Aberdeen New Jersey, Efected New York. It never made sense to me. The whole heroic generation of Russians had gone from a place to drama and conviction to these dull grooms streets. And I decided that long last to figure out why. My name is Pry the Little Thieves. I'm a physics teacher in the Faculty School. And we are standing in my lab at the physics lab. It's very teach and spend several else every day five days of it. Faculty schools at prep school are pretty hillside camps, Harry. hand-bored. But we've been in a story of being a home-trum physics teacher, one five years. I know we've been this. Well, we see our football field, but they actually play lacrosse because it's a lacrosse-seval. This is the need to be in a pool when Soviet tanks enter Czechoslovakia August 1968.

If you night's before going out into Red Square, they'd be in a pretended to get together where Alexander got it himself, the singer, so popular in my family's cup of Sierra, upon the new song about resisting authority, whose most winning phrase was a call to arms. Will you dare go out into the square at the appointed hour? Well, if you'd have dared, he spent four years inside the area and was forced out of the Soviet Union in 1974. For many people, just let's take. that's it, it's the way they look at me with the age man. And so I don't look  the one who would do such thinking the end of the day with me. But watch our maze. It's not as if they've been stopped with a collectivity around the state. Until the Soviet Union collapsed, he gave speeches. published a chronicle of Soviet human rights abuses and served on the board of MSD and National. But in America, politics will never be politics, not a way of being. Galis himself came to United States after immigration years ago, and we had a concert for him as small concert, but maybe about 40 people in some place across the river in Na'iyak. He started to sing his songs and in America did make it. much sense. I still was a great poet, great songs, but somehow it didn't sound and even Galgi didn't sound the same. I remember listening to him to Moscow, in Moscow, apart, which when he was singing for this instrument, the feeling of danger, feeling that tomorrow somebody can be arrested, some people were imprisoned, some people in labor camp, you remember host, because of this interactivity, everything was so sharp and so painful that's Galgi's songs were. just a kind of a very subtle, very desperate sin. It hasn't that he doesn't grant him here, that the achievements his power these days are his successes with his students, if he doesn't see not being Congress, about so be it this and something notiotic or something mess you up. . That's what is great about America because every one in America is something that some experience you go and you find out that on next street, that would be more expensive, that would be sold at this end, that would be some character or some guy who made 20 millions because he invited some software and that's what is in the United States. friends in Russia are still on the front lines. Sergey Kavallov, who is Yeltsin's human rights commission, and a long-time deputy in the Duma. But he subagarrasse his an important human rights actings. And I cannot read myself of the notion that there is another life that is being of my blip, a whole relevant one, which he stayed in Russian. I asked him about it. I thought whether he ever thinks about that man. And finally he tells me that of course he's gone down. Who would have met going to a labor camp in certain areas? Yeah. And if he had come out alive in 1000, well then yes, he likely would have become a politician in acting in some confusion. He's very polite as a citizen. If he had survived, because millions died in this game. And it dawns on me, more powerfully than it ever has, than asking him if he feels out of place here, I'm asking him to make that rather dead. By the time of Soviet union did collapse and there was nothing preventing him from moving back. He felt it was too low. I already became really familiar by plants. At that you're trying, you're talking the attitude of the efforts. So this is what I fought against and what I shall continue to fight against for the rest of my life. Now ... I قدت اسم一imas Imagine then in this future the impact About continued to rest of my life. I still believe in those things.

We have all the 60 if so the changes are there. Oh Wow I see a lot of connection but I'm still no other than him. In 1993, Yeltsin decided to bomb the first Russian parlor. I was so disdain and I wrote the alphabet as published in the Russian language. And most of my friends, the city, very close friends, they start calling, it's against me, which I did mine, but basically part of the message was Richard Michael, that I don't live there, I don't understand why you. So, America, I couldn't go right to say, that wasn't, I'm four, and they said, it didn't last long, right. And that wasn't completely wonderful. We're standing in front of 54 make wood, avenue, and Newton's justets. If anyone should have a reason of what perspective on distance and suburb, it would be my old friend Matt Vay, who is dissonant, Royalty. The kind of old saffron in the frame photo of how far he stares wasn't my grandfather, but he was my things. And for most of my days how he was exiled in Gordon, my days family lived near us, crossroot on a parker, take a ride, and another ride. And we had Russian and chest lessons together. As part of a parental rear guard action against our creeping Americanization, his parents listened to and got it too. More important is father was so proud of the spokes and the West. So they always have reporters and cameras. I think that a lot of the neighbors were very suspicious of us. And because my dad was so busy, you didn't have time to write the lawn and we're , mother grass sometimes. People complain and say that our house was , no, we weren't being respectful to our new neighbors because we weren't cleaning up. It'd be lower to property value if you don't, you're lawn right, right. Exactly, we were, , meeting a capitalist cent. I tell Matt, that is a child. I found it hard to have a merit in life. school in a Russian life home. But maybe he felt different because his parents were on a mission to die. I didn't see myself as different from the other immigrant kids because he was in transfers for a fall. And it just meant that they would go away from them. So, so Europe or something, or anything that. Where are my parents? , and they'd be trying Europe and talking to me, mid-Rond and , I don't know, all this weird people are doing. You think they called that at Tommy? Yeah, I remember being called. I might teach us in junior highwood savings Where are you rushing to? This for longer. Or Nothing. So red most kids Not made in think of family with sister special Until so far up down In 1989 When my baby was 16 And they went to Moscow In 15,000 people came up in one strand of And I think that was a dream point When I realized what I had since this And what I had since not been holding up to really understand. It was just, I mean, it was incredible physical experience and since that space, Costco was completely flooded people, falling, happened. And I remember just walking from miles to the night, this one in the days, because I was leaving my home in the streets. But we're not so much returning point that not interested in the world right now. I think what they learned something different is that this is an artist that we probably ever had. He has a dissidence relationship to the world, but without the politics, he simply doesn't fit into society and he doesn't seem to stress about it at all. He lives in a part of Brooklyn and it's only barely connected to public transport. He's not a job, he has various projects in his own invention. His latest is a bi-weekly zine theater team. Meanwhile, his family wants him to... settled down to more traditional work and moved closer to the trains. His grandmother, Elaine Abonner, who has been one of the Russian governments most of the Soviet critics, is also very critical of Mata, especially since he dropped out of the topcoat program. She has often told me that she is going to die by getting engaged in. What Mata's family wants for him is the kind of  they have before political work taking enormous thought. There is a wooden margin on Abonner. I meant just forgetting about. We're getting in that. Normal, decent human life, which is meant to be constantly running. It's a big, , fun easy thing. For not me, there is a very much glamour associated with this and it's, and so he doesn't find it so strange that they would live in the suburb. Well, maybe they got what they wanted. I don't feel  there's anything. So shame for me. I mean, I mean, just having this excuse me that they were talking about. I probably have more sort of mistakes. You, maybe that's why. It's pretty cool. Yeah, I don't know. I'm going to , it's hard for me. romanticized distance. I mean, I never we never talked about the distance. I have stayed in talk about grandma. That was very different. And it was not really about their political choices, but about the smile. My name is Alexander Gerson and I am your father and my father was not his. But he brought all of his fear from Russia and he raised me to the fire. He now lives in a big house and the ocean on Cape God. And he thinks it's ridiculous that I'm asking my innocent father. They do feel  he'll deal with them and he'll want them to just educate themselves and go back to nothing. It's very difficult. , if I deal with Swords. largely because you can still do these ideas. You feel what you feel, what do you feel, what do you feel about it? Well, I mean, largely my idea of the moral life comes from listening to stories about the political heroism and moral heroism. But meanwhile, we were in suburbs. That makes sense to you as a... the prediction between our lifestyle and our admiration, , the identity that everybody has to do here. Of course, yeah, I mean, if you are saying that you would prefer to have a father here, or a dissident instead of just a subarbitment. That's, I, I don't understand that. Why, I was in better bed, this is also the subarbitment. So it would be the same situation. These people are not heroic enough that they stop being heroes. This is what you are comparing. Probably they did their part and they did it enough. This is why they are stage. They did their part. They cannot do much now and they don't have to do it. Of course my father is right. But somehow there's a part of me that feels the distance. shouldn't be. I think it's because, as a kid in suburbs, I thought that history is what happened to other people. The people in Moscow and Paris and New York and Woodstock. They were out there doing these important things. And we were here comfortable on Woodford Road, not doing much of anything at all. The suburbs are about Sydney Outland, and about Pride of Eyes. And it isn't certainly have a right to it. But when they were in Russia, they proved that it matters to what you do in public, that it is not enough to be more of the kind of walls of the castle. They still believe that, as I believe, Pearson, from my comfortable American policy. that dissidents in the suburbs for feed magazine. We have to fight! On to the ball, we have to fight! X3, shopping for a better future. What's left of an old neighborhood when a new one starts to form a topic? Lots of money, but the old residents did not stop. It's American life, but it was released in the United States. It says something that one of the most profound social experiments in Chicago is happening inside a supermarket. And while the executives are dominant. finer foods wouldn't call it this year. There's really no other way to see it. For years, leaders from Jesse Jackson to Ronald Reagan argued that a business is just local before airings, entire communities could change. This is a story of a corporation who tried to follow that model. See this usually , or you don't believe, black, maybe, or you don't. Up until maybe, two years of them, it's just  change overnight, overnight. Justin Thomas has lived in his greeny green house in projects on and off for the last 30 years and works in the new store down in its built across the street. A thoughtful man who treats everyone the key girl to bread him. He tells me that his job in the store cafe is to basically do everything he needs. Which basically means a lot of heavy lifting. It was a lot of crazy stuff happened. , in years old, you couldn't really rest on shoot. games, stuff, started tearing out some of the buildings and projects. And when the neighborhood and the community could have been  real prices up, possibly school. Two years ago, the Chicago City Government began massive revitalization of Green Green The gig economic incentives to balance its to move in. All of the buildings. and new library on app. Parking. And acres were clear to go three story townhouses for trash.ca us and craft houses in the Stoom. The whole neighborhood began to book different. People living in the projects, next door to Yepnston, New Congress and logs. One afternoon, just when I got to the parking room from the soup. Over there, Charu Wright was the basketball. Wright did wear a blockbuster deal. I think it may be extended from the blockbuster. Maybe. to write here,  to maybe  wear this BMW is right here. Yeah. It was  a hayman really for , people to get up, . Of the 6,000 people who live in the projects 93% are on the phone. And when dominance kept their deal with the city, they agreed to hire two thirds of the BMW is one thing too. set out to do something on this, , you get all over one because it's everything that's good. And then you get to the store or , up and running, and then it falls apart. The Wayne Howard is the head of teaming resources about this. An African American man in this board is he first started coming to Greenick Green decade. For years he was here every week as part of the Kibriniki Tutor in the program. And thought he knew a little bit about you. But even he was... surprised at how unprepared some people work for regular work. 35-year-old men are part who'd never held any jobs. Ever. , there's no other way to put it in the man you need to be sensitive to what has been a way of life for something for you use that are working in the store. , having been a product of your upper need to be re-housing for. The city paid for a two-week course for applicants for top-not-to-wear jeans to the... interviews to bring their own pens to fill out applications to not argue with customers, to come to work on design. In short, Dominic's ran into exactly the same problems that any government agency or chair slant some events when it tries to move people off well fair and into jobs. The Capriini store manager told me that even now, some employees won't come in for days, and when they do find me show up, they're shocked to find out who's in fire. A few months back, two step sisters, one working in registered and the other door. Dragon Grosheris had an argument ruin their entire ship, and they moved punches me in the crowd. Right there at the check-in line. Most of the early hires didn't work out. One manager who had been 14 stores over 25 years said he'd never seen a turnover in the so-called. Historic sex won't say how many of the original staff in 250 are still with dogs, but they had been admitted. It made me as well as more. And every employee they write. they have to find and hire another from you. None of this gives you a sense of the atmosphere in the store, which in a way is the most remarkable thing about the entire experience. When I first walked into the doms about six months ago, a store employed, a small woman in her 70s, greeted me at the door, handed me a shop and basket, and told me to let her know if there was anything she could help me find. In the aisles, customers were chatting with each other. Teens were the green hangout by the pieces that were coming. Elderly, the drink coffee and read the paper in the store cafe. At the checkout line, the cashier was telling the joke, a slightly greasy one, to the customer and front of me. It didn't seem  they knew each other, but they were both laughing. She was maybe 20 African-American. She was a ballroom white cat. I thought maybe this was some sort of... a special day at Domets,  maybe the employees were being evaluated or is the story of the anniversary. But almost every time I've gone back, the same types of things happen. If you ask an employee where something is, they don't just point in general direction you eat. They actually drop what they're doing and take you over to the product. There's a man who works in the Ritter Department who has stopped my husband in the store, taking his bottle of wine out of the cart, and replaced it with a cheaper better version. People seem genuinely happy to have these jobs, and have the first decent story that I've ever had in this evening. It's also one of the most comfortably integrated environments in Chicago. The diversity of the stock is almost a lack of a way of this metaphor, but diversity and the customers. College groups at next-world Rooka Club, Smoke Hamhawks and Turkey Tales, literally late right next to the gourmet smoke sausage, was sundried to NATO, phasal, and primers. I  the story. It's okay. I don't think that we're going to do that story. Oh, for people moving in. The people give them little class. The more money they do, the we have. The more money they give them, the more money they give them. He headed the grammar school's championing drill team and runs a community garden project called Brean Greens for kids grow vegetables and sell them this coffee When I asked him what remains of the old man prime now that it has a new shop in the center tells me pretty much everything games drugs important Standing in between three of the high races is clear the benefits of redevelopment don't stand which Quran smells He points at a squad card, and one woman kneeling down from his foot. So a woman in the parking lot, put a notice from the strategy. Oh, they're, they're out in my dress. They're out in my dress. But you guys understand right down the side of the drawers now. Please come on. Come on, yeah. Yeah. So happy to speak to my. Oh, , , , , ,  last thing. They're all with them. Never leave. Never leave. Dan says what everyone can bring to the sense that it's just a matter of time before the city tears down high rises and sends them all packing. People said this to me months ago and it wasn't clear if it was paranoia and then recently they were proven right in every detail. The house in court he's announced to plan to demolish the committee high rises and build a mixed income community in his place. It's still not entirely clear how we shake out but the most light this is. Some people will be alive. to stay in the new improved public housing in the rest probably most of the motor porting for its cotton square or being saying so much when I was I was probably not there the whole house, nobody are outside of old street, that was a tag, the tag is here there and  black here's been walk. You have to give you a fight. You have to say in games where you walk over there, you have to fight. I want to say I want to go out to Mowberia, where from Babeloo's day, they have terrible stuff. You can go and then let's come do a Babeloo today and come to the right around the fair, so   how much stuff and the car now will come and he has to float in the car and he has to float in the car. It's peace to be that day. After that, we make things come over there. Good bro over there. So in a way, right now, it's time period. It's sort of , well, I mean, you can come in. Yeah, you can come in and you can go with families. , but this is not the time period. Go. , we want to see the few people who will be allowed to stay in the area and live in the nice new public housing. We'll be the best bats. Keep your mind over. off-public people with jobs. With this in mind, Justin, who's only working his work for a month, has made it his own personal project to informally recruit people for jobs at down next. He talks it up at his Baptist Church, encourages his kids' friends. When people find out he works at down next, he helps us set them up with new moves. I mean, if you give it, if you're not in work. place and where you're going to be. The way the neighbors, where you're going to be. You can definitely can't live on here and say a favor. That's not good. It's something that's not good. It's kind of  shaping up with those people that we have, those that want, , I don't know. I mean, God help him. I don't know. , I don't know where to be here. At this point, results of the social experiment are as far as the neighbors, where you're going to be. A few hundred people got in the robot jobs, some of the ways they've changed in lives. And 6,000 were in the residence of most of the animals of the pets on the day they told them about.
