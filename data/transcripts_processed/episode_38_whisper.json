Some guys have to support me and act in, bring sodas, coolers, band-aids. You guys who are wristwatchers, contact lenses, think that we creating the civil war that everyone draws the minds around. It's better if I walk here than if I drive. I don't wear no underwear. I don't carry pairs or bananas or anything  that. Where are they going to get the answers to send war? I eat raw meat. We have people here who believe that their impressions more authentic than somebody else's. Some of the yoses. because they, they have fleas. Chinese men came to me in one of the joining units. They were no Chinese in the 100. My unit, I would prefer, I mean, to have just plain old Caucasian males. Statism and documentary by Jessica Yu caught men of re-enaction. What you better than when men stage civil war reenactments, sure there's some tension between the union and Confederate forces. But the view battle was the one within the ranks. However, who is properly authentic and who is not? And  any complicated, speaking of an important enough to people, this conflict has spawned its own vocabulary. Because you do these reenactments called themselves either hard cores or farbes. You can guess the right one. Alright, so the guys really want to be authentic. Farbs will far be short for far be it for me. As in far be it for me to judge that person is right over there. Farbs is someone who is not as authentic as you think yourself. That's the easiest way I've put it. Farbs is anyone who would wear  tennis shoes or would wear modern eyeglasses or would wear cotton instead of wool. I see someone in line and he's got modern glasses. That takes away from my event. It might not affect his event, but it takes away from my. I'm in this for fun. I'm not really in the arm.

I draw the line of what public sees and her sees. it's hard to imagine people in other countries. English and French citizens re-enacting the Norman Conquest, or Northern South Vietnamese recreating the bloody civil war. The question here is why do Americans vote so much emotional energy to restage in the past? Welcome to WB EZI Chicago. It's a American life, my request. Each of the course which is a theme, and quite various writers, performers, documentary producers, to take a whack at that theme. Our program today, simulated worlds. We've just blacked museum, simulated coal mines, fake ethnic restaurants, airzots, medieval castle, another recreated worlds that fly above across our great morale. The Italian writer, I'm very happy about an essay a few years ago, in which he argued, that this urge to create miniature, simulated worlds is a particularly American impulse. A significant American aesthetic in one that is not talked about very often. Heco traveled the United States from Disneyland Las Vegas to recreations for old New York After a visit to the LBJ Library in Austin, Texas. where inside full life-sized recreation, oval offices and same materials as the original. Echo Road, is this the taste of America? Certainly it is not the taste of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Seagullin Building, the skyscrapers from the East Van Dwelle, but the American imagination demands the real thing to attain it. It's fabricated, you absolutely need. Once a day's program at one, the quick national tour at two, right or jack hit. on simulated dinosaur worlds. Actree, we get medieval on you. Well, we take off medieval scholar, need research to talk about that with an actual British accent. So you can tell he's for real. With us medieval times, a suburban castle, comb restaurant, comb, jelstein arena. Act four, how morning addition takes reality, every day on the radio and why we call for it. Stay with us. At one, Saddleson, make a reality. Our back to Jesus.

It reads, there lives at this time in Judea, a man of singular virtue. Well, he's alex museum. in San Francisco, in front of 13 websites  Sanctions, regarding Leonardo da Vinci's the last suburb. In this type of program rather than use the Michelin Guide to Torimera, we use an Alberto Ecos, SA, Trails, and Breality.

There are scenes blacksmiths with your bathing waist deep and real pools of water.

And you might think that growing up in a white music would become a fun thing for a kid, but he said that was not his experience. Actually, I was a chair of my own music because my father always used the music as a threat. We were not good. We'd have to spend a night in the chamber of bars. So, actually, to this day, I still get the TVG, he's walking through my self-esteem. Currently, it tells me we have to rush through the music because there is so much to say. Over 300 statues. Historical figure. New Armstrong, Toronto, right next to fictional characters  Donkey Kong, and Alice in Wonderland. The juxtaposition is actually kind of busy. It's kind of busy. And I'm afraid to let go talks about this odd even we get as a spatial temple of ease. The recent years get confused. One room, for example, depicts a dozen people at an outdoor camp. Mark Twain, Slugging Pagwood, Gracester, Rambrand, Crusher, and we will hold it a little bit of jacket. Yeah. Whistler? Baitoven? , to this trick? You will see that.

You have to keep the planet in place. It can't happen just witnessed the sermon on the map of Jesus in the apostles. A logical distinction between real world and possible worlds has been dependent on the point. It's an excess strange about combining figures from different historical moments together. Really part of that is because of space. I mean, when we keep adding figures here after year, we have to start categorizing and putting together. Pekka says that one reason Americans haven't urged Bill. elaborate lessons, to reenact, work, and strength, full size, fake, colonial count, because then we just don't have strong sense of history because Europe means having. And so it's  we're seeking to ground ourselves in some vivid sense of history, and these are the tools of the world. Probably, and I turn the corner and we see this combination of historical figures, Albert Einstein, Sidonth Bore, Charles Darwin, Gallauder, and Bill Gates, sweater, holding top people in the size of the Let's just down the hallway from a room called liquidist 80s. We can actually just build a silent, salamet, a little silent, push a board of silent, the Renaissance, and then there's a lot of high-hoove sound reasons they did during our campaign, for orchestras. There's also a room with the views that are very mysterious in groups that they are of Voy George, Lawrence Welch, Danny Thomas, John Twigolder. That is... This one is from the former Jesus' step of gay, Saint-Polaches, has beens, Rodney has no answer. He takes me to stand in front of her, just one lone figure, we open the gun, check marks. Now why is it that check marks gets his own rule? And Nelson Mandela has to, , share a room before the people. If we hit more action, other action figures are being this for also. But for now, check marks not only gets his own rule. It's a full movie set that's what it's . It's each with a own up car and pieces of a roundham, plus that semi-automatic weapon. The point of all this, is that it's a relatively reconstructed detail. The rhetoric says, it's partly to reassure people that no expenses must bear it. This is it. It's what Americans want. And insane abundance. But it does supposedly high-c American restaurants, or dark, and good-pandling , dotted, software-, and stuff in the customer, zebran twist. own affluence, states, or inches there, and bops, and big, and so, and nothing but an end growth to make an end for a shredder sauce. So the customer will have more and more, you can wish nothing for it. The logical outcome of this desire, this place is  the Donna Iana hotel in California the RaccoD describes. This way. The poor words with which Newman Natural speech provided cannot surprise the described from Donton. Let us say that Albert Spear while leading through a book on Gowding, the Swalt of Nover Generous does LSD and began to build an natural catacomphalism in LA, but that doesn't give you a idea. Let's say, Archimbaldy builds a segret of the milieu for Dalai Part. Or Carmen Maronda designs a Tiffany Gowkow for the Jollyhold Pell chain, obviously, the clush style on the street. Japan's Sonata and Buflet miners are sent by Perikomo, and it arranged me by Rachi, and from by the green van. Let's see what's going on. Let's try talking about the restrooms. They are in immense underground cavern, something  a Tamira, Grave, Byzantine polymers supporting plascabe, rev cherubs, basins of big imitation muddler of pearl shells, the urinals and fire place apart from the rock, but when the jet of urans are there, but I do have to explain here.

The amazing, the over-stuff and the absolute sumptuous at a low price it sits to its visitors. You can have the incredible. Just  the movie innards. Okay okay okay we've changed scene. You figured that out. Now we're in coal mine. Okay coal mine. Back we're taking. Being in a big coal mine. It's just how fake this is.

Now the first world will indicate that we are arriving and the think about world and again that we have a lot. Please feel free to touch the goal. I had eliminated this, but it's not cool to you or your goal. A couple years ago, Australian Princess Australia spoke. Cut city's on the phone. We should argue that one of the defining qualities America is the number of people who have been. try to shed the past, and believe you, shed. Start over to popular NASA, create a new way of life of self-suffering communities, unlike communities that existed before. In the Shavibless, Montana, gay communities, Cisco, the Mormons, and Utah. Look that in this way. Creating new worlds is what this country is. It is what we do. And so when we create these little small, simulated worlds, the aviation asthyuces. So, medieval castles, technical or movies that I've had, we're just doing a miniature preparation for a beautiful real, as whole. Here we go, sir. I think it's the best for the world to be a friend of mine. I think it's the best for the world to be a friend of mine. I used to be friends of mine. I used to be a powerful host. Back to, financial exhibits. While this hour we're talking about simulated realities, simulated world, black museums, civil war, reenactments, fake coal mines. what they can say about all those worlds is that anybody can tell that they're fake. And then we shall do what's new soon. When you go to the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas and it's huge pyramid with a full-scale replicates, things out and fun. You do not stand there and wonder, did I wake up this morning in Cairo? where you are. The world of dinosaurs presents a different problem and that's because of the nearest science. When you go to a natural history museum and you see a dinosaur, the impression that you get is that what you're seeing is not conjunction theory, but settled scientific fact. is a contributing editor Jack hit recently to start with the world of the dinosaurs turns out to be a man made world made up of pile of bones and  my other things that are made are picture of the dinosaurs is flawed and perfect and it changes. Not long ago I attended a lecture by dinosaur visionist Jack Horner. He's an notorious troublemaker, a hippie without a flammled degree, he turns the dinosaur looking upside down. He's a tall skinny thing in jeans and boots, Tangled Grey Herod. the generous beard. Honders speech was entitled, would Tyranosaurus Rex eat a lawyer. The reference, of course, is that seen in Jurassic Park when the lawyer gets the anchored off the John by an engaged T-Rex. Naturally, we all thought the answer to a semi-retortical question was sure. Of course, T-Rex could eat a lawyer anytime, any place. But Honda was there to prove that T-Rex could only have eaten a lawyer. It's the lawyer already dead. T-Rexy said, it was not a mighty warring predator. Not King of the dinosaurs. Not. Godzilla, but a slow, putty scavenger who wandered from the carcass to the carcass has blind snacking on rotting scraps. No one in the room quite wanted to believe it. Little kids just sat silent and incredulous all, as if it's at the sharks only aint find them. A hunter pile on the logic. Typically predators, he said,  lions and tigers have powerful front arms to hold their catch while they rip out the jargula. Two ricks has no arms, really. There's those dainty clots comparable to having a few things. is growing out of your shoulders. Interesting, but not exactly threatening. Terex also had big muscular legs, usually interpreted to mean good run fast, but harder as to ask how swift or weightlusters. In nature, sprinters tend to have long calves and short thighs for leverage, ostriches. Animals with stomp muscular legs tend to be walkers, typically slow, usually not too coordinated. Corner with making sense. There are lots of shifting chairs and coughing. And it was more. Cat scans of T-Rex skulls and revealed a sense of smell more elaborate than any of the species except Turkey culture. A handy adaptation of your presuming stinky corpses. Also as I said was poor, not good for predators, he turned a hunt twice. At last hornar said, T-Rex didn't even walk the way every book, National Geographic Magazine, and Spielberg movie has shown us, standing up, constantly roaring, front-cloths poised to strike. Instead he walked about  a sandbag. a bird, head down, tail straight out, body parallel to the ground, but with all the agility of a penguin. It was a strange feeling there, because we all experienced a kind of reverse epiphany. When something you are absolutely certain to be true, it turns out to be completely false. But  what you hear the evidence? It just seems obvious. I mean, there's tiny claws. Come on. It's always... tip off. But after a while, I no longer cared about the new T-Rex, as much as I wanted to know where that older figment, the marauding predator, come from. We invented, of course, constructed in from just a few bones. But why? From his office in Montana, Hornert told me that the old T-Rex was, in part, the creation of a kind of arms race, copin' marsh, and the boiler composition. Edward Copin' Ocey Marsh, the two Indiana Joneses of the turn of the century. copes associated with the University of Pennsylvania, marsh with Yale. They were called bone warriors. Two men who hated each other's guts, and every year pursued larger pots of money to find more elaborate excursions, to find bigger bones. Was during the time of PTBonum. It was during the time when you put up your most fantastic stuff in your museum or your surface or whatever it doesn't happen to have. And you drop people in and you're competing with everyone else. So a lot of T-Rex. is original persona came up with science, but just good ol' American hoxters. That's why they forced T-Rex to stand a natural upright on his hind legs, although there was one other reason. It's because people made dinosaur halls with very high ceilings in the head to fill up that extra space was something. But... I mean, it's a hard and tell-what-a-one. I mean, they wanted these animals to look for Russia so they made them as tall as possible. They had to bend the tail of T-Rex. and worse, they broke skeletons, they removed parts. It's funny, I mean, they're early on, they were actually found evidence that animals didn't drag their tails, but in some cases they actually removed the evidence. So they could get the tail on the floor. Does it get any more rig than that? But it isn't just that most of what we thought we knew about dinosaurs of raw. as to how they turned out to the century of the South VPN dinosaurs, laboratories and history, but so could Turtle בא for the war. But the world changed since, in theirочкуances. In those billions of world, the discovery of dinosaurs and where they live on live in good weather, the scaling of their rattlesnitein люди elle got extra accuracy. But are they better vexing咸ly starve to no use than their They pass through discernible fascins, changing, not as often as skirts or haircuts, but a disloyal piece,  mens lapels, about every 10 to 15 years. They've served as a kind of national psychic erector set, which we've put together in different ways depending on our mood. To compile a comprehensive list of dinosaur versions, I drove back to the first great haul of dinosaurs, New York's Museum of Natural History. Early this year, they assembled their dinosaur bones into a new, more so-called actur. display. Properly enough, before the visitor even gets to see the view, but one has to walk through a tall chamber housing the old standards, between icons of the dinosaur myth. It was good to see it. Here was T-Rex, head bowed, his new humble position. And across the eye with his long gracious neck, frisky, five-ton tail, zeal friendly promissores. I know he has something, but I can never remember what it is. Run a store to T-Rex stand in a room all by themselves these days. obsolete models parking stored at the hip-roenured displays, in other words, dinosaurs of dinosaurs. I was shown around by Philip Freyley, a mounting expert. He's the man who does the actual work of making these bones assume the positions they do. We sat beneath the rear end of the dinosaurs. Philip tried to take me back to the first decade of a century, but even seeing a dinosaur getting on a train coming to one of the few. museum's coping or marshing stock. Given Fraley's occupation, he wanted me to appreciate something else. The beauty of the armature itself. By armature, Philip means the steel frame that holds the bones up and I did come to appreciate his beauty. Each once in unions and lived and threaded are pelvis-ways 2,000 pounds, so to lift that up and to have 2,000 pounds supported on, and to have pieces of steel requires a lot. of engineering, the tensile strength of the steel, the cantilever weight. This was high tech for its time. These creatures had slept forever and had to operate for the first time in 100 million years. Put it put them back on their feet literally, because the raw iron strength of Pittsburgh steel, the American Industrial Revolution. But the exact dates are also timely. The Brana source went up in 1906, in the T-Rex in 1912, just before we all want. on the slumbering giant of America, woke. To the Europeans, we were still a friendly dumb roux with totals democracy in America, but we were about to prove ourselves as international warriors. It crowns it flooded through New York Museum's sought two images, a affable with dim broadsource, across the aisle, the Bazaarca Raid T-Rex. Friendly and Tolagetated, then fury. Just how the world came to see us, an imible joshingick, who if provoked, will kick your ass. Run! were two, T-Rex had become important enough to our nation. That incredibly, there were contingency plants, protect the skeleton, the same way we protect the president and the original copy of the Constitution. The country felt there was likelihood that the museum could come under attack by the German army or the German navy, and in order to preserve the specimens they contacted the Carnegie Museum and Pittsburgh. To T-Rex, we shipped off. to Pittsburgh, presumably where the Germans would never go. By the 50s and 60s, technology forever changed the time so we came into post-war dinosaur fashion. Where the beast once was made from the tea joints of best-seemed steel, a new substance gave him improved flexibility. Highestives. That's right Benjamin, lastics. Now enemies could have a perfectly production of the Germans for the yields. a plaster cast to be reproduced loosely. But this stuff interpretation out of the hands of paleontologists and put it directly in the hands of music directors. What they allowed people to do was to put them into a son-out rage as poses. Son-out dinosaurs could be jammed into action poses. Locked into face to face combat,  to operate grizzly bears, a rear-back ready to assault. This was the 50's dinosaur, the dinosaur of kits. There were no longer held up by steel but animated by plastic. The essence of the music. at that time, a substance in a future entirely art making. These plasticized dinosaurs continued until the 2008s, the decade of Michael Milk. In this era, no longer was the dinosaur a big dim monster. Now he was a sleek, swift, calculating hunter, the Velociraptor, the six foot tall predatory entrepreneur who learned and adapted quickly. He was the perfect dinosaur for global capitalism, who eventually starred in best-selling book and movie Jurassic Park. Now leave the date months and I do mean leave the show and tell us even problems solving and tell us how she looks at you can see she's working things out. They remember. So Rex is so strange in that movie. He comes across  the elderly member of the family. His big scene is when he eats the lawyer. The T-Rex is clearly second banana to our new star. His appearance is  Robert Mitcham's cameo and the updated Cape Fear. So whenanuck could work on it is. no the audience from the Griselda original. Now the 90s dinosaur. Philip and I walked into the new dyno display for T-rex and the Brana Sorris hardly seen relevance. We see dinosaur eggs and baby dinosaurs, the ambience is largely about parenting. It seems a more ecological and holistic, we are meant to see these animals as part of the natural ecosystem of their time. eggs, babies, parents, deaf moms. This is a story about the cycles of life, a warmer day, a greener tail. This is a story of dinosaurs not as George Pat would see them, but as Al Gorewood, emblems of a proper view of the environment, the Ego-Saur, who's seen the light of family values and the beauty of biodiversity. And in an era when America's role in the world is uncertain, when solutions to many of its problems are unclear. Our nation's standards are exhibit speak directly to our time. bright yellow stickers attached directly to the display cases. That message? We just don't know. , look at this one, right? Look at the sign. It's a big yellow sign. And it says, these are all intriguing hypotheses, but the fossils do not give us enough evidence to test whether any of them are correct. The mystery remains unresolved. Well, right. I mean, I think that what we're saying is that believe what you want. still at the past by every display it's possible to sense a coherent thesis among the hedging plaques and timid explanations. I honestly couldn't put my finger on it at first, but Philip did. Dinosaur's words most successful life form that ever lived on this planet, and they became extinct, and extinction is a real part of life, and it's not so bad. Pursure fear deeper , there's only 100 years ago that dinosaurs signal the beginning of American greatness. Put progress. When the dinosaurs died out the world ran on and other species were created, one of those species happened to be the human form. I think that in all likelihood, our species one day will become extinct. And when that happens, that's probably not a bad thing. I'm reminded of a Gary Larson cartoon. An auditory. of dinosaurs are assembled. They're seated in their chairs, they're long, necks and little pinheads looking quizzically at the dinosaur speaking on the stage. He's showing a big map of the world, poking at it with a pointer. And he's saying, folks, the news is bad. Another ice age is coming. Food is growing scarce, and we've got brains and size of walnuts. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. I'm a little tired also I'm a little tired also I'm a little tired also I'm planning to go and wait Though I am real old though All that build your years ago But it all not being a little bit so I'm planning to go and wait Now the children are born Will wake up In wonder where I'm gone And the flies fit close around Or I know I'll be No one's gonna have to get along Without me They'll say There's a little dinosaur I didn't think he's really cool I am so Where's that little dinosaur? He must be He's the boy The dinosaur The boy He's the boy He might be Oh, no He might be the boy He's the boy Oh, no I  dying to sort of come back I wanted to come back Yeah, let's try coming back I'll come back I'll back to stay Because I'm just real little tight also But I could never really go Never really go Never really go I'm Jonathan Richman and before that check hit This is American Latin who was in New Haven. We're coming up with a back-and-time only 900 years with another simulated world. It's in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues. To American Life, Marocos, each week in a program of course, which is theme, theme variety of stories on that theme. Today's show, simulated worlds, and we have arrived at Act 3. Fuck. I'm just going to describe what we're heading out of. It stayed 90 here just that North West suburbs and it's basically your basic industrial, , higher access and building what you do grab. But we're looking for them at the latest, but I want to quest for medieval authenticity because we're going to medieval times. We need little times to chain of seven fake castles across the United States. For about $35 per person, we get a Jocelyn tournament, medieval dinner, drinks, memory photos, and trip to the dungeon cost extra. to judge the authenticity and meaning of the experience, I asked Michael Kamiyot to come with his unique style or theme research. He's actually admitted as hobby to visit medieval recreations and tour sites where everything find them. He had never been to medieval times before, but he had been to several recreations of the villages in Europe where they do them in real castles. This one called the Campsbury Pilgrims Way and Campsburyning, when were you literally going to a space where everything. the sound and even the smell of the middle ages is supposed to recreate it. See the sights smell the smells, see smell the farm yard and the peasants are looking the cows and they have wax figures and wax works figures for the individual and what are they to engineer to the smell? They smell the wax figures yes. Michael says he notices an upsurge in interest in middle ages in many fairs and medieval equations. Because most people see the middle ages as a time when life was bored of it . Simple. Night's, for nights and peasants, for peasants, people knew where they started. But that's what you think about it. Then there are people who are attracted to the garlic, garlic, gargiles, dungeons. It's the same thing. It's not an idea. It's the idea of the opposite. It's disold and not all the rest. Monstrosity, not hydrogen-synth. Do you think that the impulse that draws people to a price  many times and enterprises ? Medieval fairs. Do you believe that that impulse, that the post-peak which words are things, is similar to the impulse that makes you a historian of this period? People have different reasons for time-traumming as what we are doing now. Some people, time-traumming also, to really enter another world, and to find a sketch, a sketch, or something. For the, for our great-grandparents who  medieval things, I think it was, it seemed very safe in the Middle Ages. It was not as easy as I, , if you're religious, it was a nice secret time. If you are interested in the Shibarab of Shibarab, it's almost very, a concept of honor or crucial. My interest, I suppose, is more, I see it as a time of enormous, of an as to us today. I think it is a great different from today. And it's that difference that excites me. , with the world in which you could get married when you're called the Asal, when we burn the stakes, for thinking, , for thinking things, and is it? It's all the such differences. That's what fascinates me. See, I wonder if we can see if they're going to emphasize and how they're going to introduce, we'll fill any other nations and everything will be, well, that's why since you've got to let's say that, we continue driving past industrial parks and suburban sprawl and to final. Just past corporate campus of one of the most high tech companies in America, but a robot, I go and dismayed my producer, Nancy, up there tonight, see the sign. And times, that's right. And keep your eyes peeled and clear. See the parts of the hair. I have had the underrated slide. Do you see? Oh my goodness, there it is. It's a wonderful look, marvelous ventilation. With three flights, the American flag and FSM, it's too far away to see what it's . And of course that, for an issue they have been problemed. The American flag flying over the medieval castle. A 14th century castle, Michael says, a late 14th century castle, mind with young towns. Picture, if you will. low, square, industrial warehouse, turrets, and castle towers stuck on there. As we pull up closely we see the whole building is made of this kind of plasticized cement, with lines carved from an imitate stock. Michael Marvel said what it keeps calling to heraldry, huge multi-colored shields hanging high on the wall, this is the parking lot. They are authentic, it says. In the parking lot we encounter in a pleasant smell, but we are unable to determine this authentic, the way it is not. And then, if you want to see it in a doughy should be meeting with the Royal Couple, the space to count in the Lady Campus. For barely in the door and people in great property costumes are counting compressing us. What would the Ashred requirement in the Crown and K through the sub-atlet, post James Bond, pre-rising Sun, Sean Connery, the woman who could be Princess Dress, isn't really the costumes that he knew from the Times. Walking around you realize the issue, power of language, everyone is calling you, more word in the Lady and this part, to know how to respond. Everyone in our book is very awkward for some reason. I find that I stop using contractions As if no one around me speaks English as first language. I will do not understand that We cannot open to not all girls get it Antimium often quickly frees up. I'm gonna play you the some piece tape and , what you need to know is that when starts She's sticking big boom microphone in the count space What is this? They're supporting a stretch line at a solidiano, not what they did to cover me, I believe. All of a sudden, that morning, she bouts. We mean  harm. Thank you. I'm glad you heard that. I thought it was taking wish and oils, so this was for sale, letting me think. And we are each handed a black and white paper crown. You and I are , there's no question whether or not we've got to wear these crowns. Tonight, you shall be cheering for the holy and pious, warrior priests of black and tonight's your mortal enemy for this evening's tournament is the bread and yellow night Michael our meeting for scholar is loving this and I mean loving he loves how they try to get the audience and about the experience of the fact that everyone is fighting to six different teams each room for different region of Spain each room for a different night because the fact that we were introduced the words of this castle this is just a lot of this is so much more exciting and I'm not this is a very warm What are you seeing that you're lucky to have a very nice to be welcome to the Lord of the Medivitat. Hospitality was a crucial aspect in the Medivitat. It's a whole point that you will be to be a bit of bringing people from into your and in your large yes. Because we are as members of media, we're simply taking side to be greeted by the real word of the castle. It seems less of babies, and he is not the case for rather a real sense. Life was very important for our victims. I'm the man that cuts the fish. In other words, I side the paycheck, so yes I have the law. This today, this is the general manager. This is the medieval time started in Spain. It's on his first Spanish and so the tournament where that disease grew creation. Of a Spanish-style tournament in the year 1093, this is main difference between the two European castles on the right of the world. We have seven states, thousands of names do so, let's behave it. Good night. It is by his account. very high. How much is one of these buildings cost you for up? Between 15 and 20 million. How many people do you serve here a year? About three hundred past. Marketing management steeped. That's really an appetizer. It's been a thousand bowls of soup. 300,000 chickens. 600,000 glass Pepsi. So it's rather involved. How to get it? Respective an executive. What these numbers look ? I think we actually should be seen in the castle. What these numbers look ? I'm going to get this sound out of it. Get it. And now, let's get in. Let's get in. Medieval times in Chicago serves 300,000 people a year. During the 2000s, also the size of the audience is Chicago's public radio station. Or I work. Now let's consider staff size. Size of National Public Radio's entire network news division. That's all of the money in addition. I'm going to get this sound out of it. Consider it. All of National Public Radio's quarters are. all over the globe is 195 people. That he got times has 250 photomic co-years at this one castle. Remember there are six out of these additions. Many of the times as an annual budget that is millions of dollars larger than national public radio and all of this data may not mean all that much to you. But from where I said, I feel that it pushes me to this disturbing conclusion. And that is, that I work for a radio network that is less. popular in Chowstay, sport that is in debt for years. All the way around please, very last three sections. The United South Palson to Arena that seats around 1400. It looks  a medium-sized professional hockey ring, partly because they have those plexiglass screens around the edges of the oval to a super tech-gear to divide you from the corners, to a down there in the center. I'm incentivized person to serve you, St. Sam. And the tiered seats that rise up steeply on all sides of this noble table front of dinner. And the city color code it, everyone reading for our night,  night night, sits together in a group. Michael notices the music. As these people are processing in, we have a gory and chant religious music. Beautiful, but the surgical music going on in the background, which is fairly strange as a tournament. Strange and an act. I don't know why you say that one in that group. You can't measure experience  this. So actually, I just don't think that's the right pressure. You just say, this is right because I think it's how it feels. But that doesn't feel quite right. Please  your blessings, but you're not going to have monks singing out of the whole liturgy before I talk. It turns out the entire evening is scored with me. It's  a movie. During the course exhibition section, it's kind of disco or something. Nancy's where she heard Carmen. But mostly these accents  soundtrack of movie whose images and values and get right down to it. I'm straight from the north. This isn't the sound that you came to star wars. N directly. Happy New Year. Well, Happy New Year. What's Re的 Ajarence with it? I'll be your surf tonight. Tim brings us each a medieval appetizer, kind of boat pizza, medieval roasted chicken, which is the precise which is important because we give no silverware enough to eat a cup of hands, and a medieval pepsis. Nancy might come in with a hateful but... Are you a wenge? I'm a wenge. Are you a brinkswenge or a wenge? I'm a photo wenge. I'm a photo wenge. When formed at Wenge is an actual job title here. That's only application. Wonder it. people put it on the resumes once they've worked here, packed their lunches, server lunches. this is the whole Wednesday, the whole idea of it is just to complete, but in the real middle ages, meaning actually never served food to nobles, who are getting people who tend to turn it and it's  this. And in fact, even the word which did not exist to much of a trader. So, when she's the one who, , he oldy, when she is a, is a modern construction. I mean, that's a construction something with London, of zip. the 18th century, it's not the opposite of the Middle Ages. Soon, another anachymism. All the surfs and winches, traips out, central arena. I know the natives show your appreciation for your hardworking surfs and winch it! Oh, surfs and winch is around that. Yeah, the story you see, you've never had surfs of my chis. How about the tour of the field? The cursor too low, and that's a little bit. This is America, where any surf or winch can grow up to be pressed, so it's no surprise that commoners end up on the plank look nobles. And it is the nobles who start on the show, 6 nights and 6 squires, all of them are long hair and aging now. The gifts and the look that's part middle ages and part chond lines are all the way. They start by doing these complicated massage damage for sure, of course, these beautiful stashes and who are entering to sidestep… the night's end do these various kinds of target practice or spad. Plads, as they spear tiny grass rings for the night's end. None of this,  the same. We can part of a real thing. This would be practice on practice that you do before now. Then, we'll need to install a smoke, while machines on that switch, and that some chimistic cannot see for this very purple light. I'll put it bigger with plant. No, no. No, in the arena, they split the subgroup of Maddox Grace. I saw some of your bald salsa that didn't want to see. You're this is Mont's Lord God on the high-breast hall. Let's see. High priest of the Jews? Right. We can see high priest of the Jews. The Jewel. The Jewel. This is a funny mixture. We're not doing it. The judge, we're in England. And they vanished 600 years before tournaments  this. They got Stonehenge. This is one moment that they would learn to play this in two of the discipline. I think the Treasury broke kind of, why didn't you smell anything? No, I don't know. What we all know is that the government is to bring in a healing of magic. As opposed, this is a new age you bitch of you. After this, they're more impressive course. told that we're supposed to do every time green night readers, green night set up as the evening night is passionate. Michael says that particular color choice is not the best says that middle-aged is green is color goodness. He says that he says it's a great and green night. Black he says it's more accurate color to represent evil night, which is but black representing people probably would not find the most cultural America. Timeline Tiger practice is the main event. You're holding a couch last, that's the last that you're holding, you're right shoulder. And the whole point is to be japs yourself and throw the whole thing upon you. So wait a second. These guys are going to charge against each other and this is a correct material. We're going to charge it to the other, kind of hint to the off-off voice. We're not going to be the big stick. That's what I'm sure everyone's japs is. We minigurls and the audience give hand-cretches various nights to carry into battle. I historically correct them, and then the Justin begins. But with the course of the evening we've learned the next to no facts or history of other creatures. But middle of the times, does stage great fun. It's complicated and cinematic. It's a set earlier there's music through everything that happens on this arena. It's totally choreographed at last a long time and it involves no fewer than 14 people and six horses. 3, 9 yellow off the course. Now the green guy is coming out of the... What is that? That's a miss. Hold me as a ball on a chain on a stick. And now the yellow guy is staggering around holding a knife. Who knows, hold, stand past. I'm lost in the cup and I'm lost in the yams. I'm not a horse, but I say it is mountain game. the bad day now it's getting down now wait now without happening a road turn on they tell they gotta get up before yes because often taught I'm swach it's a mischievous right nice even when night printed back on the battlefield they walk off their horses to farm English became the great warriors and the ladies my getting up the horses just  this and fighting on the ground because you could do what you're not horse you could do that  the last thing you could kill someone are they in the evening everybody's been to kill it except for the evil green night, and get sent to dungeon, and one other night. Our night, the black and white night. Later we were told the whole thing's fixed, and they put us in black and white team, because they knew he was... My point is that the whole idea of these night was to try to kill each other is not historically accurate. Most tournaments were not in history. But despite this, he liked me. In the car in the white homes, with its many conspirators in the spirit, with the spectacle, circus, and populist, it was low-brow and best possible sense. It was a homestead thing. in the act of the set, we're inaccurate in authentic, in terms of costume, design, action. I think that's the long way to figure out it. If that wasn't accurate representation of Earth, and even tournament people would be bored, stick they wouldn't go to it, they wouldn't get any of it to it, because they lasted six days, and they were , , you're not going to be surprised, , it wasn't the time to experience the spirit, the spirit, the spirit, the spirit. The set of each will be authentic, it will be very boring. But we were driving out to MIDI, which I'm generally, my client said, thing that appealed to him most about the images of his ovens. That did it did not seem  a long car. And in the car home I suggested to him, that MIDI for times did not create that film, ah, it was most of a familiar image, just movies and story books. It was weird enough. And it's, calling all the mixtures of strange things in it. I mean, the hot mixture of the modern building and the castles, structure and the long head. punky knights look  sentopholes from Playgirl with the... the ways that the things were mixed together to me in the strength of it was medieval because I was at a middle ages, it's incredibly high-bredant, it confuses, that's again, that's a cat anybody's not, it's not the age of order and systematic, high-artic level of things, but the strange thing is new describing is not the America, Exactly. In fact, Spore system-sern America is a very medieval country. I'm more medieval, it must be nerve. In the Middle Ages, it's not a pioneer culture. It would just be getting to create things. It was a new sense of newness moving forward. Evangelical, full of weird, wonderful mixtures. Ultra-religious, and yet the same time, ultra-dechident. I think that's one of the reasons I was so fascinated. In America, the Middle Ages, because we're kind of...we're living. In the commemorative photo, they can put us a medieval kind. The distinguished style of... The University of Chicago was grinning at on paper crowning the set. Little mock frame they put photo inside says in papers at bottom. Your night to a number. That's nice. K.N. G.H. That's four simulated worlds on the radio. I work for National Public Videos Network Headquarters in Washington, studying when I was 19 years old. Long time ago. And I would  to talk for a minute about how reality is similar is constructed on programs morning edition all in essence. Programs I love, programs I worked up, consider morning edition. Bobbi, who's just as low in the machines of your stories coming up today, and then he says first this news, we'll call a castle. Why does he do that? And we will presumably call his closer to reality. He's closer to the truth. to the thing being simulated in the simulated world on the radio. In that class, starting the stories is processed today in Russia, somebody did whatever and then he hands up to a reporter and again, why does he hand up to the reporter? Well, presumably the reporter is concerted to reality truth is being simulated in the scene that it worked and then the reporter comes on and the reporter says, okay, today the Russian person said whatever and then the reporter goes on, okay, it's up. the story to some piece of tape in the quest. And that is the tape is 12 seconds. We put 10 seconds, 17 seconds long, and it's  one long sentence or maybe two sentences of somebody's some brush in saying something about something, right? And at that point we're there. We've gone as far as we can go. We are actually at the real we're hearing a tape recording made out in the world. This is the real we've arrived. And it's interesting that the word for that piece of tape in radio journalism. is the actuality. It gets as precious piece of the actual world on the reading. Okay, this whole apparatus, and then finally, you get to what's real. It's funny better, it's how puny it usually is. a sentence or two. ? That's how much reality you get. That's how much actuality you get. Okay. for 101 years old. Well, I promise to be today by Nancy update yourself based through Home gospel to your planet. remind units are come to our lives to them.
