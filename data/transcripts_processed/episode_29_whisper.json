I've been young people. Big happy event celebrating his bigger. He will be not more optical to step straight. It's the famous visitor that's now in the war. sin to John Kennedy, 1964 which in my view makes it even more appropriate for Bob Boat years. Now I'm in Berlin, John Kennedy's contemporaries, everyone. Bob Boat is 73. Now I'm in the world world life, she will be 70. John Kennedy will be 70 but instead of a big, lively event, powerful voice to his young people. We did, the golf person campaign strategy is big, both they follow. In an order. You own a pick and see the pick of Bob Bowie's and Simu Simu's. , they have to be a huge hit. , what message are they trying to get up fast to us? This is a campaign. Nothing we are to work. Now, each week, we are on the small thing life, which is a thing, and for the wide variety of radios and the pharmaceutical,  the type thing, the documentities, the radio monogods, replotage, sounds, tape, occasional radio dramas, basically anything they can think of. And today, we've been able to speak to some Bob Burm. Because it is this thing, it is the same thing. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But it's going on in my community. Really a day goes by and everybody's in hard, harder, strange, hard for just to get into his past week, there's this thing in the name of his heart. The Republicans have put themselves into a convention hall. For the Republican convention, and it's  14th year tall. And TV guy was called the mayor saying that, , it doesn't mean I can look bad. I don't think that there's really no way to film to shoot him. the TV, which is the entire point of the model for the convention. This is why she's done with that one with the model. And the positive thing. And since that one, yeah, my heart just goes out to the man. Something deep and put into the man's step in. You can go home. And you may have taken three hours. One came pain dollars, at two, in search engine how you, from the combined goal. At three, I went to who you can find it, you can not put them for four months actually, got him dead and he ran in. Usually he waits about him, so he sees the show, hopefully he holds nine or two when the most steps. One key element is to the text, picture and image command. sleeping in conversation till the end of the body debut. About the time we were to do everything, things  flirting with each other, and this is another way to find out if I'm with another one. So, I tell the doctors to if I understand there's something in the opposite direction. And then there is a lot of good things. And the critical analysis that's in case in the scenes and the stories, it's just a complete puzzle. And it's just got a way great on where you go out with. And then, and all ends were found one by the different from from the words. We're going to pay you not a set of stuff that is written in that word. Just because among other things, he catches all these names, nobody else gets. And that would go. And the reason this thing is wrong is that dull in this painting, this is what we can see something. And this is our firm, let's see, this is our first of the day, and this is from Backland Commerce. This is February 15, this is our after the final meeting today. This is the day where there is this warm, well, well, we've got to have a sharding basically said the Forbes and the first one is negative odds. Those don't offer gold from up at the stunt, they're going to be talking about me. , the movies use a decent picture. They'll all hands in these pictures. Which Forbes knows that the game is not okay. So all it gets covered in class. But after the book, people leave the stage or something. And her good on my previous, , heads out onto this stage and he said, we can all the Detroit stuff where we can now sit there, communities, right, themselves. Other stuff, maybe I should not, is that wedding night. And then, then he sees the photographs. I'm going to be a piece of paper. I'm going to be a piece of paper. There's an old piece of photographs. They ran the shop beneath Forbes, Perium, they went to Facebook, juga, and we're going to be buddyy of them. So, is it anything someone makes for a year? And they'd be asking me to pass them by the evening. I was wrong, I never would tell anyone to sleep for a reason. To a carol, I got one for me, first mouth. He was standing in the garage, he could hear a tired and pain. I better one of those to have to learn, letting nurses be the other one. Before this black and white, he was smelling the wrong way for me baby. He looks really innocent. The doctor, he touches the people's woman, he says, So it's up and it's up now the baby's working. Baby, this is a hundred pairs of notes in the room. I asked five different dollars, the identity of the baby, held by dollar and further than half a day before. It seems that anything left to her, after all, this was the picture of gold, it's  a food publication. I'll get no answer. The basic pose of the gold came, is the last thing that it finds out about their hand, with the death. You can spot the dollar, this is the world glass boxes. and ground floor from the hamster holiday. It's the one that newspaper came from the glass to prevent people from outside into me. Gold himself remains largely out of sight. He makes two or three very brief turns each day, and his otherwise unavailable from the moves. Gold's speech is that nothing in the general blind picture. A dozen times, I listened to his call, and poisoned by the overtake. Nothing. Nothing. None minutes. not a pun. It took me a while to figure out why this was his within the struggle. But goal wasn't running to the lesson. The constant thought that it was me. Man himself had subcontracted about all the dirty work. The people who made their careers out in the suitful. That was why he was in the first new sentence that he personally. He wasn't there. He is not in the name of it. It turns out that everything I will discover about Bob Gould, I will discover by stealth. My first discovery is embarrassed by his own name. He's catching me back room in the game just before he's about to go on stage. He thinks no one is looking. He checks out as we're flocking furtives. His hair is sprayed and done. In any website of his pocket, honey cameyst and squirts two pit blasts, breast and endings. Also, his wit is genuine. It's not just an end. He's stopping through the snow at the world dog setting championships. He's watching meat and bacon poachers. The school girl is purchasing me. As he's about to leave, and after that he's got her asks me if he's having fun. Learn what I mean being in Dallas and he's mostly into a snatter-peen business. But all nice dogs too, not  the Congress. He thinks no one is listening. Instead, it's just for the fun. All other than that, that doctor, it must be inferred from the world he's created around himself. The dull campaign consists of slipping on many blue suits, forever whispered to each other in dark corners. The campaign pays top-tock, everything. Now you get the feeling most working with some person from the ancient state, and dull, soul-in-all, and that that be the last account in the way he shouldn't be doing this. You also get the thing that you very little that you can't even get in with not good.

He grates through and part, is the fear of the thing he's been clapping for, he was still hearing him in the primordial. And when he successfully fed and fed off on the field pond, he rarely worked with us. And now certain nothing interesting to ever occur in case we're in a strange day. thought he was going to land and then he simply fought a little. he didn't know what to happen. He survived 2 years. After you walked from the space you finally knew as the 4th was a place but you came right through the dagger. You were cursed and you were poisoned and you were killed and you were injured. You were to get to the place that you liked. Remember, mister Cole? The announcement for the people and making the person on voters, if it is legal, this will be the same. He probably wouldn't come down. It is the few weeks of the name statement from this, he brought tears to our eyes by saying that, in our opinion, the office of the whole, that is being legal. The obligations to the people, the issues to be moved, and flavor to the person, and then the part with walls. But according to Re, the most decision between this wonderful scene in Re is ball-litre scene is a PR scene. John is often used to be in scene. The scene is in the genre, it's not important, , it's the original scene. The scene is in the genre, it's not important. The scene is in the genre, it's not important. I'm just gonna ask you what I'm gonna ask you. Come on, I'll you, you, you, you take all you have to take me. I'm just gonna ask you what I'm gonna ask you. This is American light, America's. If you can upload in the course which is subject, you can get variety of varieties of different stores. So there are topics. Aw, boy. you go right now I'd act two of the children, act two, how you can do. For this act of our show we have invited you welcome to our show and then we have a smile go. It's my goal, it personates about go. On the day night with coming to Brian, just go and personally let them in the day next I'll be sure to let them. his former headwriter, the solidina alive. And he's probably best known for a sketch that he created. It's a solidist and it's really, it's almost hard to believe that a single person came up with this idea. Because it was mostly just in the spring out of the competitive unconscious of our nation. This is a sketch that a solidina of record the superfeminies, it was a bunch of Ashikago, Shikogor, guys, big guys who have talked about their girls, Dables, , that's my tombstone listening. Anyway, so at some point it became clear that it's my goal. This is going to be the person who's going to be imitating Bob Ball in the kind of Librarian show. And above the mean, he does this, what he's accusing is screening. This sort of a TV marital can stand from the ceiling. And then kind of a brand talks to the mother, and the mother is a CEO of a full golf girl. And in the website, Tom Kidd. and all of a sudden, so you don't see those things, you see the smile of ourselves, and then it does, those words. So when we came to the user, we're gonna have to imitate Bob Go. He said about to, , design him, get, , think about, you're the pain. Thankfully, I thought of Dan afterwards, and from some, you can see, you're burning, , you're drinking the sound, , why? What I try to do is, is all, is find something, take it for him. because otherwise it's just boring to do things that doesn't happen so long. And now I started with the monotony, sort of how you could be into the monotony, not going to the mountains and the abstracts over the mountains and then you could have that, . And again, Akari kind of does the bully from the 70s. Well, back then, sort of mix and powder. And then I figured I took a little further and make a little muslims. They're about everything. They're about to get into this building. Then I figured out about girls actually the fleece in the muslims. She's not a muslim, she's actually. We're just passing the muslims. What is the call of the muslims? We're not a mayor, but we're not going to land. They really did it. She did it. Keep going. Keep going. Not just going to Brian, how do you listen to me? Bob, no one last night. Bob knows New President of the United States. That's right. No, that's not a rose. No, top of the post. That's right, no, it's in control. No, it's writing a border. No, it's zero. No, it's zero. You got books. You got books for that, no. Isn't just a little sweet about you, I'm patient of both. I'm on. from them because this is always a little bit scary. I'm telling you, he almost seems to be seriously well, it's just imagining, , he's deep in star seems just letting them out in 1239 more in the ocean. So I blow, I blow Glec Gretland and say it's all set. Think of a real branch. They can sing at the end of the world. I'm going to have a snack. Don't ignore, don't ignore, don't ignore. Because if he's stupid, his lyrics are never heard. And so... I think about it, it's a thing. It shows the deep impression, something. And the way that I never could see him doing real well. When I do a politician on that show, I'm almost always doing the, , the aid of that politician. It's basically, sometimes I just don't think, giggling, pouting this more favorite thing. Take all of that. We have that next. Let me drop. I think I'll check imitating somebody you would have to do. Yeah, it's hard not to wrong I mostly sorry to me it just seems  it's really gonna get worse. I mean at the point where he's supposed to catch up, right? You see rubbish magazines and that because of the weather the to this update though as this new part module trong that is playing together two or three words in the series. And, , pretty dope. In this image, in this version, in this edition. Who wanted to do it with just a music? You just, you just forget where it is and what he's going on. And then, let's get a small watch in his problems. Come on. Come on. Why won't Bob go the baby? That's great. That's how he's Bob go. He's got a little bit of Bob go on. Why won't Bob go the baby? Not those hiding. enti skip. around and start talking about the situation. As somebody who is doing this drama, we should tell very soon, first we're going to set the blame to launch me. Go, what we make of this house, sort of a community example personable, I'm going to tell him the rest of it, and how he gets to know you can do something good. I'll make fun of that on the floor. and it seems to be anything that works on. Yes, from. So if you buy that, and then you have to be the possible basis. You have to use it. But also, can't just end that stretch. Stretch is trying to get in the way. Basically, we need to use something just  this. I mean, supposedly we use another one. It's not going to be this good. This is not a thing that the place where we go to is man. what if it seems fun? If you tell me when you try and hop, paint more. If you burn on a relationship, you think that will be the same. Oh. So, yes, you have given me tips for how this looks  me. I'm just a little bit nervous. I'm just a little nervous. This is a couple of pointers and how they might be. This is a little bit difficult. You mean just a few people? Physical moves? Yeah, physical moves. I do. I do. I sort of walk through the bottom. I start with the task patterns. The matter. When they're in the middle, they don't have the same things. They don't know. They're happy. Oh... and then you can't even afford to buy me some money. , you can't even pay for some money. Well, depends on how far you want to take. You can pay for some money. You can pay for some money. You can pay for some money. I'm an ideal. How's going everybody? And there's more of this more effort for this. it opens? Just withdraw these and then you get one 2 challenge to begin. Gimme mentally roll the allows here. Worse is going directly back here floor. You can do what you want everyone do this while you switch. You can get a glass of bubbly air and push. You can win! It does. Grab it smile. Yeah, it hits Bob Durstall. And then I'll leave you. Stand my center. We're going down. Take 76 for a while. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it again. Sanford, Paris said, to be number one happening in 1964. And this time, 68, we want to come to the kids. We want you to pick kids' votes. And you're going to do it  they want to get ready. Sanford's number one. The world is beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. After two different minutes. Most of his experience Bob Ball, World Bomb Bomb and television. Less of such experience most of his meetings in his computer. And without you discuss Bob Ball, his television for the world with that, somebody who writes about TV. And the person who got, is he done in Danish running? And he writes something in World Bomb, called Mano 2 and Rupy Waffin. And this is his Bob. the TV show, Beverly Hills, Mahno, too. The way he writes about the horizon, he is in his immune system, more, of all than he. Crayns from sheer cuttings. To his own analysis of the program, he needs to do this in all the anchors. And then what are that means for the nation as a whole? Who are they taking progress into what a person is supposed to be on his own mind? And so we, we had to sort of a little bit of a short, door of his violin and, and we found to have to view him a visit his website, weren't, but the addresses turb thunderstorm. you got you, got you visitor, got you, got you, got you, got you, got you, got you, got you, got you. Anyway, so we are, we invite them, we'll wake up in this, yes, we're involved in the dissing them for our show, they asked them to watch, Bob and Mr. Victor, when they pulled them, he said, I'm not, I'm not, I've got it to be mine. So I'm not you Larry King, Larry King, Larry King, Bob goes on the dark way so you can power it to let it shine. All this bit was going to do the dress in world fast-wared lipstick, which I guess means you. going for that red light and beautiful. The first question is about the state in me by somebody that, hello, she did a visible. In Bob Dahl's, , it was a joke. And those details, , it was ingress. And there was a bit of a zan in our, about how they insisted she be on the presidential candidates, which is probably because she doesn't know what's going on there in World Nations. So, more likely, because as we said in the early morning, success on Tuesday's, means to persuade the announce fatto to be a mayor's life living for the presidential candidates. in Barbell there's only nine of our his passes for picking a VP. In all cases, no one is on the top father's name, but  all these things, within the process for Barbell serves to list the things that's going to be this puzzle, you take them in fourth and age, which in fact can't really help the human body shouldn't be able to say that it's health-grade, but in all cases, a painful dog can't keep him because he's really important to us. So when this is talking about kiddo clips into the other doors and how she didn't stick to a script we just talked about the book that the doors were in which I guess was Elizabeth the doors could start talking about the book which she did. And she makes the inspiration she wrote to L. King which goes to L. King. She's writing the writing to L. King. She's talking about the writing to L. King. I'll be brought by a slide from the door wide. So I'm 15 years old since. And the program is mentioned in the book. L. King. But actually, it's ended Elizabeth the door and shaking the door while it came. If you want to interview the boys of the police because the Lisbethol gave him the plug in the book that he had a extremely sturdy, wiery and clean. When all two points is gotten down from the Lisbethol, the big old smile on the faces of the thought we were there to talk about the book, the flower. I can't hear she's a Lisbethol, and the seriously we never wanted to be on the Lisbethol's hands. That's all right, number one. can't use him. It is a bit there is talking about him known as engaged because it's summer vacation. The Americans, all well, knew in the media, say some sake as tomorrow was happening. And how new are to the Mr. Melee manipulation himself talking about the buildings out of the media is that they are totally in the atmosphere stating the fact that he himself is nothing to do it. how many years have you been there? And remember, though, instead of casually dropping his best words one by one into the conversation, just wheels off a whole bunch of them hosting. Who are large? the system on the whole text, and show you the Pimba door down. And I have to wonder whether Lary King has really got water sent in because Pimba don't keep making the spaces as it got my beautiful keys. So then as it goes talking about Bob Dors message and Bob Dors and Janey, the only switchers are really awful is that the Jane the boat keeps. The one Bob Dors basically says that without told the Jane the politician can't keep, which is a key scale for you to ask me. Many ads in all the boy tweets of their big Putin is no longer free. The onboard scene how is glad to be beingергant and the real screen for the powerful success video in the oscillators about the energy and power of location. The main part is that detecting the more we expect when the AR?? The core,ها with zero Sonic doc and LMAO appears in simplifications. Bye birdabe Meanwhile, Lairking is making her Susan Marlale theme and who's  a big family of the city's, and Bob Gaw as women's wellness. The women's are going unknowing all the surface time for women on these rules. More ironing is now strictly answered in up to embossialing, and we're going to mid-town and nail the stool when seated in front. In mid-town there's a state's shop which shows a rhythm of the national identity of home. In this one moment is, look the national gadgets that's hiding high. I believe they should keep money that everyone says with MCI, which is another huge number of people who are doing it, and people money to obtain of nation debt. So, they should ask so fast, who are you voting for? In the second day of his name. I don't  the situation may be a one bit. I don't see anyone with any handballers as good ideas and don't  banks or don't  his stance on issues. Plus, I think he's too old. Unfortunately, this is new. In a certain age,  two old, he will be a one-term cousin, and the other lady is testing it in the one-term cousin. So maybe Bob Dorr should write around on New York Marsh Faze if he gets a sense of what he should be doing. The long Bob Dorr goes on about what he's done for women saying, I've been waiting for the woman, which is a real, real, real thing to say. So then being able to identify as you done, Bob. the Shaman's sponsored by the Republican National Commutation in the Smurking Kid, leading through two balls of murder design that we need. The Women's Equalization for Life is a mission that is found staunch in the wing. I don't know that it's such a good idea that I'm only thinking about sickness and death in the numbers and programming. The American things have to be the momentary game , yellow area we get with a three-length street, put working in the same age. Americans , how did you get involved in this debunk thing? Bar something, just ignore I guess. The new rise of Bob Dole keeps looking at him since he's morning, but our son is a boss danger that is looking at the cues. And hence, it is a true virtue that the endeniable coals about the contemporary money and Bob Dole's pocket is simply a chess viewing. And then Bob Dole says he's not scientists and so clearly now that smoking is addictive, which is real because later he refers to relatives who are sick of smoking more to problems  how much evidence he personally needed that day. Moλ are kids  Ok klaramer in such smoking. And Bambar said, yeah, all these stops smoking, and we'll talk about the problems that we've taken with many other people with lost control of the signals. , when do you think most respiratory disorders come from the news? The main problem is that it's not that we expect you to help don't do it. And Bambar said that, what he's about to go on, the news about the toll and telepsi and the news that's it, we all laugh and we get a lot of things to be medication from the cell and the patient from the news. So don't  these aspects of this betel when a batch is being used in this fresh lady. She says, going on, that they will support us now, so my bone is a joke about all of the influences of this fusion. So when we look at the money we are going, we want all these betel's going on, but going around the country to places where many child views as they can view the surroundings. And we are sure to download, if you want more conversing, we will go to search and put me up to the package. So don't be afraid go down there  this now, speak to the content. is a legitimate court of question. Can you say you would never tell a one? And Bob told us, yes. And when we speak to all those, yes. , who's question is it? I don't even know what I'm talking about from the function. When I think of the conversation, it's a quote from the perspective of your own. They think the law is quite innocent. They only get the health insurance question. And they'll help us in genes and days, and jazz and dietary things, and they'll think they'll not serve. And they'll think they'll not serve. Next, they talking about the stocking, and the company that calls the latest in thinking how to work with the phones. The coalition's urgent, and I'm hoping he was that guy who called up and Jason Hills was on, thanking him for all his work and controlling Blacks and he was in Blacks. It was also an idea to see about Ronny made today,  the one call that they take on the show, he was some local who didn't get the date they were going to work with the company and pass it on to his. The company gets to his multi-million for his. the loss of his immune, and should unknow that bad dog to the poor with a part of his should have cut off. No king asks whether Susan Malnalli could so approach her abortion state as to be a pebbling. This is Malnalli is no one but her. This is the more of the being of the convention of the baby. There is no greater animal than to speak on behalf of the gentleman who really wish all. If you think Susan Malnalli just found the dog or something, then the relationship is going on. No one knows. The Susan Malnalli found and available for the ta feminister bath crew. Especially when Larry King plays with the Bob Dore's, the best he's approved most in the Larry King's. And then Larry King needs a pun of the money that the news funk is on there that the two points for Michelle to remember are NeverLive, the Susan Mawonari.
