We were taking it because almost  a kind of industrial sabotage. Back to how to be a man, right as Sarah Miller, a tense class in New York City to choose women, how to walk and talk in an act  man, that tree, strength and numbers, six women, a van, a 12 hour drive from Mississippi that starts in the middle of the night and ends in a casino and a cotton field. That poor, taking sisterhood one step further, happily married a polygamous white experience how having a Women married one man is the ultimate feminist lifestyle From WB EZ Chicago and public radio international and American one. I'm our regardless stay with Equan Fatty suit David Sedaris this parable pressures on modern women and how one woman the sister Spong my father called me late when recently Sunday eat Excited with the news at my sister Amy scheduled to appear in a magazine called on the York Women. Can you imagine, yes? My god put a camera in front of that girl until she'll shine  a diamond. Between the single man and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook. My father was always placed a great deal of importance on his daughter's physical beauty. It is to him, their greatest asset. and he monitors their appearance with an almost freakish intensity. Because it was always assumed that we would go to college, my brother and I were free to grow as pump and ugly as we . I might wander freely through the house, drinking pancake batter from a plastic bucket, but the moment one of my sisters I'll be spilled if a key, our father was right there to mix his metaphors. Jesus, Flawsea, what are we running here at Gary Farm? Look at you, you're the size of a tank. two more pounds and you won't be able to cross state lines without a trucking license. Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves however briefly to drugs in alcohol. The one exception is my sister Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose yourself. for nothings. For Amy, school was dedicated solely to the study of her teachers. She meticulously charted the reputation of their shoes and blouses and was quick to pinpoint her mannerisms. Practicing alone in the basement, she would pace before her king-size blackboard in full costume. Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, referring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved. the bed-ridden mother forced the take oxygen to retain. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood in Country College. Choosing from her box of wigs and cast off dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail, instead of the wreck room bar, master in her slurred inflections. She was great as flow-wagoner and Eleanor Keller, but vocally her best impersonation was Penny Midland, a stylish 50-year-old woman who worked part-time. an art gallery my parents used to visit on regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother's better calf pens, Amy began calling my father with the office. Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversation list, our father would fidget before saying, Penny, will, what do , gosh it's good to hear your voice? The first few times she called. I need to discuss gallery business. But little by little she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive being banned. I want out, she'd say. It isn't that I don't care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life, I don't know that I can stay married to a man who, well a man who likes boys. I don't know how else to say at the man likes boys and that's the way. Our father offered comfort with such standard, non-committal phrases as, I guess it takes two to tango, one, you hang in with me. Oh, loo, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands. I walked into the kitchen late one after new, and came upon my 12-year old sister proposition for all. I was thinking that maybe you and I could get together sometime. Just. Last for laughs, unless we felt  taking it to another level, Amy studied the reflection of the oven door, brushing the white bands away from the forehead with her heavily jeweled fingers. All I'm saying is that I signed it to be a fairy attractive man. Is that a crime? This was what my mother meant, which she accused people to play the dangerous game. From my father to accept them, he's offered. Amy would have known the musical handler. and wandered who well seemed  a slap with. Everything he'd ever said would be called in depression and stand for possible sexual contact. Was that really a business trip? How do you snuck off to mortal B to if one of his previous tools? It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let penny down his gentleman's possible. He offered to set a rope with some available bachelor's pregnant and she made her debut with herключ. IVM and told my sister to take care of herself, adding that she was a very special woman who's up to be happy. It was years before Amy admitted what she felt. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine a very confusing period of time, for poor Penny Midley, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of the worst business associates. Here's the gal I was telling you about. he'd say, to Bob's sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think that two of you would make a dynamite couple I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don't you. Le llev TO Hazard the passage time is not altered my father's obsessive attention to my sister's weight, parents, and because of that, most of them keep their distance, checking in on me by phone. Is it just my imagination, he'll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me, is everything okay? Because she is maintained or beautiful, skinny, and youthful figure. Amy is my father's greatest treasure. She is by far the most attractive member of our family, yet she spent my most of her life admiring skin diseases, and praying for her home. It's not fair that I can't grow up here, she'll sing, gluing the pebble-sized ward to decide for others. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can't see any benefit to being herself, and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise. She's got all the net braces and faults tea the person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty scent. She's provenless now about how you can be suspicious. Help her heal your heart, anditzer, and asleep your heart. She enjoys wearing beneath sweatpants, tight and uninviting massage cases. She couldn't afford the matching top and is reduced to whaddling the streets much two women fused together in some sort of cruel experiment. From the waist up she slim and fit, chugging forward on legs the size of three trunks, and followed by a wide, dimpled bottom, so thick she could sit on a knitting needle and never feel a thing. She wore it home last Christmas. Where our startled heartbroken father met us at the airport. He managed to silence his disapproval on the short ride to the house, but the moment Amy stepped into the bathroom he turned to me shouting, What the hell has happened to her? Jesus Christ Almighty, this is tearing me apart. I'm in real pain here. What? Your sister, that's what? The girl's asses the size of her being back, chair. I thought you were supposed to be keeping an eye on her. I begged him to lower his voice. Please don't mention it, Fr. Amy's very sensitive about her. Her what go ahead and say it her big fat ass. That's what she's ashamed of and she should be I stole mighty naked land choppers on an ass  that. Oh Don't try to defend her wise guy. She's a single woman and the clock is ticking away How she's supposed to find a husband with an ass  that? Well, I said a lot of men that. You looked at me with great pity Chuck is had. What you don't know could fill up block. My father composed himself when Amy re-anchored the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a bit match for the gas tank. What in God's name are you doing? Look at you you're killing yourself. Amy hug the court of ice cream. to reach out and search the doors for a shovel-sized spoon. Your problem is that your board, my father said, your board and lonely in your eating garbage to fill some kind of stinking void. I know what you're going through and believe me, you can lick this. First of all, I'm not bored. Besides that, all I've eaten today are statin pancakes, board donuts, a Danish at the airport, and a couple of really small brownies on the plane. She kept it up until her father, his voice cracking with pain, offered to find her some professional help. I'm begging you to reach out before it's too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first you have to admit that you have a problem. When Amy rejected his offer, he attempted to set an example. Settling down to Christmas dinner, he pretended to be satisfied with nothing but a sliver of white meat. accompanied by a single spear of blood. His athletic regime became theatrical. That felt great, he'd say, finishing a round of set-ups. Now I'll do some squat thrusts, a couple dozen push-ups, and it's all for a satisfying run. Anyone want to join me? Amy? She kept to her fatty suit until her legs were chased in pimple. It was on the more... of our return flight when she revealed her joke, and our father, bracing himself against the countertop, wept with the light. Ah-ha! He laughed as though we were reading the words off a page, the way he's always done. Ah-ha-ha! You really had me go at-ha! I knew you'd never let yourself go. The fatty suit only re-integrated in the photo shooting hall while we were such enthusiasts. She had me fooled for a minute there. Buddy! with the fat ass you can't disguise the fact that she's a beautiful person and that's what really matters. Do you , Japanese know if they're going to be hiring a professional hair stylist? Someone who really knows what they're doing? I share his hell hope so because her hair is off way thin and someone needs to talk her into losing those banks. There's a lot I don't tell my family when we call them asking about. He would not understand that she has no interest in getting there and was, in fact, quite happy to break up with the living boy for. He was a pleasant hardworking fellow whom she replaced with his warfrab at mean cattle. Tattle pale enjoys chewing the electrical cords and as a result my sister's phone is often out of order but it doesn't seem to bother that available men can't get through. The last time she was asked out by his successful bachelor. She probably was. for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I'm really just not into white guys on you. This alone would have given my father an angrizzan. The clock is ticking, he says, if she waits much longer, she'll be alone for the rest of her life. This seems to suit Amy just fine. For the time being, she seems perfectly content with her rabbit and an angrizzan. imaginary boyfriend she's named Ricky. We'll be walking the street to her west village neighborhood, running errands, when she'll turn to me saying, Ricky gave me a bumper pool table for a one-month anniversary. I came home this afternoon and there it was, parked beside the baby grand electric organ gave me for president's day. I can know you played pool all saying? When did you start? How did you learn? Oh, a few months ago, Ricky taught me how to play on her last flight, Korea. He didn't tell me he was Korean. Oh, she'll say he's not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on  this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable. Hey, my father will ask, what do  about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he's really something. What exactly has she told you? It's always best to ask what he's already heard. For all I know, Amy could have claimed. that Ricky was in AVC of, or the chief surgeon at a hospital specializing in diseases of the kidney pancreas. When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I sang ignorance. I didn't tell him that, at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair, and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed and flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. Bye-bye. and their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their rips and cheekbones. When called forth to the styling cable, Amy said only, I want to look  some of his beat me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on his forehead. The glossy allopools surround the her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with... me and Rose, Rackish ditches. Amy was enchanted with an uva. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry criminal and grocery salon. Most people nervously looked away, but on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible, saying, I'm in love, can you believe it? I'm finally, totally in love, and  what? It's the screen.

But one of the problems in doing a show  we're doing this week. A show made of different strengths seem to go together because they were all about at some level. Different ways of being a woman and a girl. Is it you find yourself treading around all these broad generalizations about men and women and actually none of us should be worried. But, we figured, we came this far with this name, and met as we'll head down the river into the heart of darkness, and gender it per se. And playing the Martin Schenrolin over the gender apocalypse now will be Sarah Miller. Sarah Miller for a while had the odd job of being a woman throughout a sex column on man in a man's magazine, ETAF. That job seems to consist mostly of correcting guys, gross misperceptions about women. We send her to a class with you back in the years. city run by a woman named Diane Torre, a class that tries to teach women how to dress and walk and talk  men, which is kind of a reverse on her regular job. Sarah Miller put on a loose fitting planisher and tried to imagine transforming herself not just into any name, but into the kind of man who does not have a kind of ambiguous mix of tradition in the male and from much rets. She would become a guy's dog. I have to admit the idea of the workshop made me anxious. This before I went, I told the friend that I was afraid I... I'm already seemed  a guy. I'm tall, I'm loud, I swear a lot. I told him I was afraid that Diane would say something to me , God, you're a natural, and I would take this to me, you are naturally coarse and masculine, and naturally not at all pretty. I shouldn't have worried. It turns out there's a whole world of gestures and attitudes between me and a final shirt and me being mistaken for a man. There's the proper way to walk for example. Diane demonstrated. Sense of ownership. Sense that when I walk into the swing anything, anybody could be mine. I could own anything in anybody or everything in this room, but I'm only that my eyes rest up. So that sense of ownership is conveyed in the gaze. They're not afraid to take up the space of the own space. Often, check things out. How does this place structure? So when you walk, you think you have a perimeter of boundary about three-foot around you. And this character where he walks, it's coming from the shoulders, hits the tight, and he goes side to side at the same time that he goes forward. So it's  this 360 degrees, moat around me, okay. And we gave it a try. I thought so. was the quickest road to nail us, but when I looked around I saw the other step ramrod straight. We examined each other for clues. Oh, so maybe just introduced yourself to the people in the room. Just, , shake hands, those small, stop smiling. Smiling was the one thing none of us could seem to cut out. Diane had to remind us again and again. So as it became clear to me that I was not going to eat as a convincing man. manufactured a goal for myself. I was here I decided to learn arrogance. Yeah, so you want to cover the impulse first of all. I'm going to start laughing from the bottom. An ace bandage of my sisters is the first tool you need on your path to gender liberation. Mine was double-wide and kept snapping out of my hands as I wrapped your arm  chest. It's going to be quite tight, quite tight. But not so tight that you can't breathe in this. So remember you're going to be wearing this whole day and even. I close two big Levi's, a platformal shirt, a Princeton t-shirt with Hebrew letters. I would have hung nicely on a guy's broad shoulders and slim hips, but I looked a little lumpy. My breast had not disappeared so much as retreated under extreme dress to the middle of my chest. Two sad, misplaced lumps on certain of their meaning. My whiskers were good, but my eyes, day and point into the set about all of us. We taint the f- hopeful sweetness of femininity. And if I resembled anything, it was only some strange hybrid of a lumberjack, lady from lady in the tramp, and Marie-Anternet. I made up a new identity. Now my name was Dan Rosen. I was a brown dropout who worked at St. Mark's Book Shop. I stacked the at knee readers. I bought Paul Oster novels on Disco. My parents lived in Mount Kisco and were laying. Brown was laying. but arie Fab разм went out, and another one was hell vibes As day on I sat down for my eating lesson and I noticed that none of us were really winning any prizes in the Realms department. Two of the girls had long hair, tied back in ponytail, when you looked at them you had a split second to decide if they were women dressed up as men or the almond brothers. And it wasn't the tough call. One of them asked Diane how we should be sitting. Love soap them. . I told you to take a lot of spaces for soap. Really? Yeah. Let me see if guys are dying. I'm sitting next to them and they'll be in the zone around the seats. When is pushing, what into your legs? I'm so worried. The soap weighs as well. . We could sit and eat with our legs as wide as we wanted, but we were not meant. One of the almond brothers that's in the omni-bling. away through about half of his Peterbret, eating it with a slow deliberation of one not a piece of food. The other almond brother looked a little bit  a guy, but she had this way of nodding and saying, mm-hmm, he should listen and it gave her away. Only Diane dressed up as her alter ego, Dan King looked  a guy. It was the eyes more than anything else. Her is recall, detached, they assumed rather than asked, we were all too eager and naive looking. I said that we were quite little deaf. tend to be eating grass and everyone laughed. When we finished eating the places a mess, food, napkins and take out containers everywhere, no one wanted to clean up. We sat in our men's clothes staring at everything, not moving. I knew what we were thinking. So, no way we got some fucking bitches to clean the shit up there. Yeah, yeah. My eyes took for the workshop. Once I realized I was in very little danger of actually resembling a man, was there I would have some great... insight into the mystery of what makes men men and women women. But I think there's no mystery left. The train of genders, too familiar, whole of places, we've visited way too many times. Men are detached on a apologetic, on a Friday take-up space. Women are consolatory and self-assigned. Men go up women's sip. I'm not sure there's anything, Diane, or anyone could say that would really surprise any of us. I did have one moment in the workshop where I was... walking across the floor, shoulders hunched, looks in a scale, where I felt what it must be to be damn rose, college dropout, keeper of the magazine section. Is this it, I thought? Is this what it feels  to be a guy? But I realized that what I felt useless, defensive, underachieving, bored, tragically adolescent. It's not about feeling  a guy, but about remembering what it felt to be in my early 20s, and then putting this on for which RPM makes sense that would be a βremel which makes motivation to pursue the level to achieve an opponent's level. That's great. to be a failure. And I don't need to be in drag to tap into that. As our graduation ceremony for the workshop, we wanted to go to a men's club to watch strippers, but it was a Sunday night in Giuliani's New York and we couldn't find a single one open. I was secretly relieved and we ended up at a restaurant in the West Village. Right there in the booth I served to shesly unwrapped my chest. I ordered diet coke and a salad. Sir Miller, these day she writes a poem from Men's Help magazine, her novel Inside The Mind of Pity and Rayburn, sending out the smart. Coming up, who's looking me as feminist lifestyle that's a minute, which is called the video in Public Radio and Connectional, my problem continues. I have my request to be going to publish a theme by the variety of writers and reporters and everyday people can then speak on that theme. Today I have a program to enjoy being a girl sort of. In this second half of our program we turned into stories of individual women and girls to stories of groups of women and girls we derived from back three, strengthening numbers. This is a story about one group of women and I have to say that every woman working on the show at some point during this last week has expressed a little indifference to women And I think maybe the best way to start their stories with the road trip. Barbara Jull, Lynn, Tiny Valley, and Rosetta decided to leave the husband's and kids and grandkids behind the road. I was the first pick-up and they picked me up about four or a clock, four or a clock in the morning. We arrived at the donut place and they were not open enough. They did not open until seven. That is sad. They were not open until seven. They were not open until seven. They were not open until seven. on the way north six to the clock so we can go into the Donut place I think they are landing on the ground. We got three hands in the car. We landed on the tower and we just got hit a road. We got to sneak up into the room. So it's  four in the morning so that's two, four and six in the morning. On a Friday morning and you decide you're going to visit one of your friends, one of the hands was in the hospital before you hit the road. That was going to be a break. Yeah, but , I thought we kind of The poll is doctors from Europe and we come to see early in Jones, it's a special case. They do it on TV, all the time. I can fly to my DCS and I'm , I work for DCS, but I do work for DCS. I'm a little bit shy to tell my service. The problem is, I'm going to show my ID instead that I have to talk to her about her kids. At five in the morning, I'm DCS. I got a ton of kids. I said in the morning, I have a last one. They picked up, so I didn't know anything about that. Just a point. I'm here for the next three. I'm not my dad, but I don't want to be sad. I need to get my dad to pay for that. Yeah, I'm the first to get him. I'm a shipper. But we don't want to get him. I'm a slumber. Give me the hand, though. I'll write that, Rosetta. I'm a slumber. I'm a slumber. Hands. I must have been with no one in chat. I should say what teenagers bring up the minglewood in Chicago, Southside. A couple joined the group in the middle working with other hands in the switchboard, Palmer House. and every march they take big trip together, or they throw a party,  they did in their dance to do with themselves and families where everybody will wait and go, everybody. This march they took a table quarter and throw a crumptious cargo to a casino in Mississippi and back in three days. They visited a straight hand and worked down some sound. Three of the hands jeweled tiny and warm things we did to pop the things we wanted. In the south they caught they say that one is a bunch of women. get together  a few. Yeah, and say they have a mean one. Yeah, but we didn't take it as really, he ends to the guilt. No, that's our reason why we only stayed as your guilt whole day. Oh, he's out. what I'm saying? That's what it is. Now he needs to break your own face and , mean mine. Yeah. And you guys will have to tell the average work, so many minutes of money because of that. We just did something  that recently. The last body to follow that. Valin's son went off to the arms. So we came together with our families and had a big body to it. And at that barbecue, we scraped together the money that we had left. We sent him off to let him know we killed and sent him off with money in his pocket. And we all had our phone numbers and records. I'm having a chance. Yeah, we know he's going to fight. We try to do things  that to let each other's family know that we're here. So when your kids were growing up, we'd be able to contact each other. And my kids basically stay with Jordan by our allers. We all had partners take sort of each other. And our baby's work. One, two, one. One, two, one. one or two one over. I was one on one day. Tiny was one on two. My borrower was one on three. This moment in the tip of you guys heard in the last trip, we're really, literally. Everyone in the van is talking at the same time. And we understand. They definitely. Hey, man. What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? We met tiny Jordan. Yeah, I told him. What we did? We got to get the deal. We had to go and get this car. I told him. No, that was not. I can't go. We're now nowhere. We've had this thing. Should we go because we got this. And we checked them. Not sure what happened. While we got these models out, we were sitting in the �om Interior Group. Me and that car get in. Yesterday, both of us were talking together together with them. Yeah, we could remember it. Let me know in the comments if you guys are supporting the moon and fighting moon and we drove for how many hours because we're heading from Illinois from Chicago through Tennessee all the way to the 12 hours. We drove 12 straight hours and we're going to stop. We stopped at a great place and I got the great restaurant lamb or home of the throw roast. It's  so what you're talking about and you guys stay throw the roast at you. People stand in place so I know that you have to catch them. throwing rolls at you. Throwing dinner rolls at you. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it. So they're rolls are so good that they couldn't serve them fast enough. So one day the owner just threw one and that's how it starts. So all you have to do is just hold up your hand and it's cold. And you can't sit. Now there's a recording of this and somebody apparently is nothing. Break a chat with me. I'm not gonna catch it. I'm gonna catch it. I'm gonna catch it. I'm gonna catch it. Alright, so what's the name of this post people? The Amber's are wearing it. In the States, 57 and 55. There's love. Every time we get together, it's not funny games. But then when we get to get the following time, we laugh about it. The last time we went over that really was fun. I would have. Because, Valerie for years, Valerie, you're always... So, she picked on Tony. Tony, you're a Tony. The Tony is the slow one. She's very slow. You look  you have to wait for her and... , she's a little bit... I hope she's on time. Yeah, , so she can't decide what she wants to put on. So, this particular night, Valerie just picked on Tony one to many times. It was about some pictures or something. So, next... He said, woo okey, he said room, hooh you throw rope on there, you throw rope down here. He's at woohoo! Woohoo! He's coming over there to get found! That's where he's coming from. That's where he's coming from. No, Sally and I left it each other. He's dead. Oh no! We ran in the rain. He left it there. I'm not. That's the clothes that I . But it wasn't funny at the time. He's here to get in the now. We left it. There's a point where you guys are aware in there and you let this conversation better bush in the beginning when it's a bit of a destroyer newspaper. We came point in the conversation, finally, when you said, we were such brave souls. We have a tab of kids because most of the kids were teenagers. And then Barbara says, she's kind of off my kid. She says, we're not so brave. 7 months pregnant, quite cold. You're  a father. I'm not gonna say it. I never forget to look at the latest face. Whoop! Whoop, can I have a face? What? You don't need to be a dickhead. I don't need to be a dickhead. I don't need to be a dickhead. , and it started, so. Okay. And you look at me. Very good. Oh, shit. We're not gonna have, , the same amount of fun every time we get together because, , our lives are changing, , , one time, sit around, come get in, oh, , we're realizing the heck, we're getting out, , when we have in there stuff. This year we had a serious issue. We faced a tiny father dying. But not so that you knew that. Yeah, we missed the war. I was just getting it. So you have to tell, what do you think? We'll be quick to explain to the town. You look soooo. It was  Vegas. Sitting in the middle. , we have tried to encourage it, but they never do, , but they, they, , they're real supportive. Now, , we really have to go through a lot and they don't get crazy. We have tried to encourage it, but they never do, , but they, , they, they, , they're real supportive. Now, , we really have to go through a lot and they don't get crazy. the closer we get to that the parting time The angry mama's and it's really bad use to that I'm thinking he's really got entirely , remember when y'all can't do pick me up. This is calm and chair And that's how my day come See y'all y'all John was the one He calls me in the room. I want to pray with you He's that I just want to praise you. Same thing, but I'm not okay. And he's holding my hand and he's praying. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And I'm , , okay, John, , five minutes later. He's still praying. Okay, John, amen, bye. I'm getting a little mandarin. So I'm here, so I have to... What would you have some board days to do? What days to set? Okay, you got to give him your step. When you're coming back, can we say this on the race? Now my obviously lazy ships could not deal with the hands. We had break up. I just said to be less easier. Yeah, good bye. Yeah, and I broke up with it. That's what they say. Yeah, they could not deal with it. We are yours. Below him. , because we have so many bad, which room we have prepared is we're gone to sleep together. Somebody is constantly with me now because... Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! This is me! Hey! Hey! Come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Put the men in your arms, then serve the friends for him. Yeah. Thank you. Don't do it. Don't have the same kind of fun. they get pretty sick of hangwear. That don't think we can have the same fun. The very few of them, the one we have. Talk? It's very, very interesting. Definitely, I think it's very much more of a stormy. I  it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I can't even see them. I'm so scared to see them. I'm so scared to see them. I'm so scared to see them. I'm so scared to see them. I'm so scared to see them. I'm so scared to see them. Yeah The hands, tiny lin and jewel in the studio, also Barbara was at a Valerie Sally Tony and the next time is the song that they always played driving home from their trips when they have to return to their husbands and kids and live. I love you. X4 taking sisterhood one step further. If you ask Elizabeth Joseph it was the only reasonable choice. Mary a man who was already married to five women. She met her husband and she was a senior. Well, you look at somebody in my situation out on the school in one year's old. I could eat a marry somebody in my own age and take another 10 years and finish the job of raising the mother started. Or I could marry a food and failure and then practice divorce, lie, and  there's all kinds of wonderful excuses for divorce, but my definition is a failure. And or I could have found myself somebody in a building shop that didn't have been a million money. in the 65-year-old world. So, , I'd say it was no gamble, who was demonstrable, that didn't have to be demonstrable as they thought it was. So, it was really risky situation. Elizabeth Joseph is an attorney and now public affairs director in the media station in Utah. The upper-hand story is part of our show as another example in the continuum of the Academy of Women's World. She says that, because she was in a polygamous marriage, she'd be doing things  go up to law school and finish law school, and not have to worry who's taking care of the kids or husband. Whether what's wrong with that. In short, she says, Puligme is the ultimate and the lifestyle. It's having a man on your own terms and your own, is in your bed, in your house, at your reputation. , the juggling act of so many women have to put on with respect to careers and family. I was so much relieved in our situation because there are so many of us to share this for actual roads and all that, Access, hobbies and all that. Family and conversation for those of you who  my experiences with your systems, because it still radiates all the humbs and others that ultimately resonates in all of its own thoughts, taking into consideration the things I've talked about, taking into account the opportunity to express, doing what I've told now. For this community and coordination. It's so helpful. It's really helpful to answer on a large rudiment to the human health experience, but have it more community,Get to help our cleansing down the world, So able to go to work with the guilt-reheart and child, never seize the inside of a daycare center, anything on that day. With people who care about me. Now your husband has been his eight-wide. Yes. And how many of the wives actually stay home? I do all of them work with some of them. Yeah, we all work. We had nine years ago, three of us had babies all in the same year. And there was one. my particular that we really wanted to watch out for the kids while we were at work. And so we went to her and said how much how much is it going to take to get your job for a couple of years. So the kids go to school and she did that for us. And she went back to her. When you say how much will it take you to the rest of your pay her? Yeah. Look at her. Wow. This is all my fair. She was working hard. So when you first met your husband, had you been considering for what the news Oh, only. very recently because of Brandon who was proposed to me also but no I didn't even know existed when I was in college I saw him and I had no idea anything was going to modern news where the LDS history of glass and trees . When you met him he was already married to five well how did it caught him happen I thought actually, you can. Well, we were separated by a thousand miles, see proposed by the letter, and I came, flew down, spent my spring break in the senior year with him. His family, he married to my best friend from college. So I came, I thought as much to see them, but I just needed to check out the situation. I went home, Mary. What did your family say? They were understandably upset, but now they're going to tell me, Luisa. very educated but a month in a cowboy for my brothers with a rifle coming after me. My mother's very educated smart woman. She was heartbroken but she was going to give a dissociation with her only daughter to maintain point. Can I ask you to just explain just then the practical terms of it? do I say everything in separate houses? Does everybody with the same house? How often do you see hours? I see hours. every day and for sure. Strangely, I have a home that I share with another wife just that's so huge. And  Margaret has her own place and her own place, she's a very nice and nice and nice place, but we're all right close to getting. And that's not  if he's at Diane Nantes house, I walk right in front of her and make myself a home and we enjoy each other's company. Margaret likes to say that you've lost home. and you're just maybe one of us just because that's his nature. And yeah, there's three of us that have and groceries were close together, and it's a long standing tradition for the four of us got to dinner together. And it was in groceries. We just, , the family spends a lot of time to get in because our very fond one of the mothers and the families. And the accepts. And how many kids are there? Twenty, when I'd say about half a cone. And then how often he actually says. Yeah, we actually stayed with him when he's got his own quarters, but over the years it's very eight and almost 20 of them. One kind of sexual appetite and not a living. I think it's mid 40s, it's a little different. But in talking to my monodoms, friends, I have that kind of exchange of his name is locking on. More often than they do. And , roughly average one-to-week, it just means. Broorookous I've heard a lot of men talk about talking about the advantage of it as being this. They say that there are certain things that a new looks to a man for in terms of when talk about things and because we're going to be some vision of certain kinds of cause friendship. But a lot of men just they don't talk that way. They don't relate to other people that way. And so one of the advantages of religion is that the women, the wives can get that family. lives. That's one of the huge advantages  and that's a really nice thing. Some of our fun is times it's been  on a business trip and we get together and have it to keep a party or something. You just laugh and laugh. This is no good to me. I would, , wait a while. I feel about when there's really extraordinary pride in me. We're extremely proud to be associated with a fun mother. And this had weren't in the situation. and look into it and we didn't  him. We got rid of him. Well, when we did it. Did you have sensitive V-type power of whether a woman actually gets to marry him? , it's not, it's the fact, though, okay? I mean, rural as he'll be marrying people. He places. But he has learned over the years that if we don't  him, there's relationship with him and his own note. So yeah, we do stop or she. And , do people get jealous? Do you get jealous? Well, , us American girls are raised to be very insecure and jealous. Either what is a trait that you would want to embrace. So, in the early years, I think as with any marriage, it takes a while to feel your way and get into that security established. And yeah, there were times when I go, why, yeah, , I can see why it likes moderate and I think that's a well night. Then after a while you go, you have a good idea that Margaret doesn't. And you just start and he does that. That's his job. It's good that security is not in the sense that you love you for what you are. And 25 years into this deal and you sort of got to pay him back. I'm not too threatened. Is this something that you think is to be widely recommended to people? Or do you feel  that you are just in a special situation with a special man? And it's not applicable. There is only certain kind of people you got to be. For example, I had a son who had a family in the house. Anyway, a girl came to him, growing up in that community. She said, what I said, you're obviously a good father, and he's been kind of married. You need really  this girl. So, if he was blown away, , I don't know if I can do this, and of course I knew it very well. I'm a son, so , sort of you're one of the few guys. I think you lasted  10 years. And what do you think you can work for? Well, usually two wives is very difficult. You really need a third to balance it up. But usually the most common scenario is the two women were ganged up on the ground. But you're thinking , one out of 10 men, if they're doing it , it's  one out of 100. One out of 100. A thousand. A thousand. A thousand. A thousand. That's why most of this boys, most of this boys. So they wouldn't enter to you because they didn't have this college. They didn't watch their dad do it. And the main difficulty is just keeping everybody sad as fun happened. Well, yeah, you got to be with my smart  he said, I would do  it when working during the night, what it was  today and we do. We do. We're strong, we'll be in the pen. Same with the thing. Yeah, I've, I've, I've, I've only met. I'm not anybody that... could do what Alex is doing. I think more important is long-term politeness who's a myrane respect, well let they've done it. In terms of demonstration, they've been committing close to his money. This is Joseph. You got it. The lens will kick it the wrong. It is wicked. It's the one that don't know how to be close to you. The victim's only got to be at you. It's great. You take you. Now it's half the wrong. Can you relate to? Assist it's open up. So make your college screen. Are you letting me take it from here, Queen? Excuse me, but I think I'm allowed to get it. I'll just take it. I'm a person I see where I am about to do what I'm the same to the post you have no whatsoever the clue. I'm a very happy and I make it happy. You're very, very, very, very happy. I'm happy you'll be enjoyed. Please, the world I've been from our most of the time. I thought I could see you all in the other town. Totally, yes, but we've faced the decision. Maybe first, yes, yes. Yes, they're going to be the same here.
