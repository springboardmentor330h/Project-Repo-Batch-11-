They didn't investigate our sins. They would be fires, go ahead and they'll several times a day. It was just fire and jigs all the time. So my daughter started to believe that building is got old. My people got old and died. That the building was over and was dying because of it. Before our story begins, Chicago was run by the Democratic Machine, a black-haught and Danny Davis, turned out to vote for the machine, election after election. But the machine didn't reward the black-words, as well as the way it paid back to white words on the north side. The street cleaning is the sewers, newly paid for roads and sidewalks, economic development. Actually, , we had called the areas. of colonists, I mean, and just basically picking up the garbage in these boards. Just trying to keep them clean. So we all probably, a question who was elected, , there would be so much focus on garbage pick up that, , you'd almost have to just be the garbage old. I mean, I recall telling people time and time again that I was tired of just being look. are visual. Forestry begins Chicago political machines squeezed blackheads and demobled trailers, high public schools, rather than letting them attend white schools, which sparks away. Forestry begins the Chicago machine dot high-rise public housing, hold blacks on the south side, and keep them from moving into white neighborhoods. Forestry begins the Chicago political machine, but a system of highways. The coincidentally divided black neighborhoods from white, and particularly insulated the mayors, our white neighborhood, bridge court. Typical inequities, unemployment and white 11-word was zero percent. unemployment and fourth-word, but black-sword, is 25 percent. This is a story about one ethnic group in the remote, so many other ethnic groups down in this country. But zone candidates in city hall, one mayor's office. Because it's a ethnic group happening with black. But that doesn't  anything that happens in the Italian politician and Irish politician Jewish politician hates the law. White voters deserve their own political party. White politicians try to stage a public slow motion coup. In the mayor face pressures that we've different from those faced by any white mayor of any city in America. The story happened in the 1980s in Chicago. They're not trying to hear the story without thinking about what happened. Another black politician took office, Not on the fellowship. how he faced pressures in opposition, though we didn't have anything I've faced by a white president. The stars, people saying he wasn't a citizen in the United States. There's a backlash and a real part of it was about race. Back in 1980s though, when race came up in Chicago, it wasn't signal with cold words, dog whistles. People didn't pretend things were not about things. Good evening, Ron. Good evening, Ron. We're still watching them. Good evening, Mr. Washington. Could you clear up a point for me, , hunters? and that once you move into City Hall you're going to remove all the elevator boxes and replace them with fines. Is that true? It would be fine. What? Replace them with what? What fines? Vinyus. Vinyus. what? I'm not even going to ask you why. No, I don't think we have 3 million charges in this city. It's not a mean reward. You'd better pay some bills at 2 Coloubberg. Did you find another 1 ditch? Maybe they're 1000. of the world. We've been busy Chicago to this American life, America Glass. This weekend marks the 30th anniversary of the death of Chicago's first black male, Hero of Washington. You died early in the second term of office that you made some mistakes. Today we remember Harold's story with the show that we first put together in the early days of our radio show, with the 10th anniversary of his death. If you don't know anything about Harold Washington, you're in for a treat. Is this charismatic? realistic man, funny, smart, and great talker. Democrat framing issues with the skill that is hard to think of any Democrat in office right now, it does as well. Practices to get things done. I've one of our program today. It's about what happened during Harold's life. Let me have a short act too, that one came out. Let's see what we can do. Where does the voice you're going to be hearing of? of the power. It's mostly people who are close to Howard Washington. Many of the activists and politicians, Lou Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, then Alderman Eugene Sawyer. There are people from his administration, Jackie Grimshaw, Grace and Mitchell, Tim Ullblatt, and some reporters of Hollywood story, Brendan Jarrett and Row Anderson, Gary Ripley, Laura Washington, Lady Pincham's press secretary. There will also be an occasional opponent or voter. Take a photo of John Yorkon. at one yesterday. For decades, Chicago politics have been run with an iron hand by the legendary political boss Richard J. Daley. Our story begins just after his death in 1976. When the machine was sputtering, he was no strong leader and the possibility, small possibility of change. It gives you a sense of what it meant to be a loyal black ornament in Chicago. machine at that time. Consider what happened in City Hall, the day which you daily died. By tradition, the President of the State Council should have least occupied the mayor's office until such time as we process the election of the new mayor. And who was the... It was in France. a loyal black, all of them from the 34th law, but daily democrat, a loyal, impeccable reputation, impeccable Then, to shameless uprole. The only misqualification here would be black. God ordained that he be more in black. And the power structure sent lease offices to the fifth floor on the city's door, sent false, even entering the mayor's office. That was a tremendous insu. It was an insu, but it was not unusual. The way the scene took to the black leaders of the day. I mostly, there's leaders there with they were told. Spatenshikago had nowhere to go with them, cut them down. They were stuck. Then, there were a series of famous and especially infuriating insults from the White Protocol establishment. Biggest among them, White voters finally elected an anti-machine candidate being Jane Burn. And once in August, betrayed them. Suffered up to the White Machine, made appointments and decisions, specifically to prove she was not in the pocket of White Chicago. Then. Circumstances came together, some by planning, some by luck, they made it possible to elect the Black Mayor. The planning, organizers registered over 100,000 minority voters, called Rally's meetings to find it was time to elect the Black Mayor. The luck, two white candidates, split the white vote. One more piece of luck. Chicago Democratic Party had created a spite of itself. Howard Washington, running Jared was no friend and a local newspaper. Yeah, I was in that part. Now don't forget how I have done a precinct gap. His father had gloomed him as a precinct captain. He said he was what he was having years on. But his father was done wrong. So hell, it was not usual first men who had lost this resentment. Well, how the Democratic Party had deserved his father. At one time, his father ran for all of them, very good. He's confused. I got a little sense of mission in him. He wanted to do the right thing. But that he is. balance stuff for this pragmatism that you've got to play ball to a little degree with the organization and he was correct, he would have made it without the democratic machine. Usually in Chicago, Kutokawa activists had a choice that you go with politicians who were good on the issues but then had no political experience dealing with machine, where they could get hacks in the machine but with terrible on the issues, Washington was the rarest kind of politician. To live it on the issues in the machine, which was why in fact he did not know what on the top, we promised it's center fee, a draft black name. Well, we talked about her. He was reluctant, very reluctant. At the time he was in college and was enjoying being in the college. And during it partly because he was part of the machine. He set some requirements, how much money would have to raise, it had to get such a thousand new voters. Yes, that's what you never got that at. It used 50,000 knowing that no way in the world. Are they gonna come up with a thousand? New red then, what's hard in those days? Come up 50,000 reds, those. They registered 130,000. They're good. Come out, if you're going to jump right here,  what put here was washing the... over with a broad masses of likely when they had the primary debates. Oh, that triumph was a televised debate. No, because you had daily, you had burning, then you had somebody who could talk, Harold. But you'd be that one. Daily is Richard M. Daily, son of the Glate Mayor. with your J-daley. Burn was Jane Burn, the event in common there, and Harold, you're in New Harold. Those were the three Democratic contenders in the mail-over race. It is the fall of 1980, okay? Here's a typical exchange between them, three of them were asked to one point. What they would do, anything. About the police department's office of professional standards, the place in the police department which handles complaints about police misconduct and brutality. Jane Burn and Richard Daley. Sound-based squeegee- normal politicians. They have federal truism . I believe that the members of the police board, shared by Reverend Wilber Daniels, really do take that job very seriously. Here is the most specific that Richard Daley, that's turning, that's it. I think anything else, there must be improvement, there's nothing wrong. Proving, the office of professional standards. Here at Washington comes out. What is most notes or is that he sounds a kinky. was what I do to the Office of Professional Standards. When I answered, I would be the only one who asked the question. The Office of Professional Standards was arrived at the long and torturous situation in this city, in which members, however, members of the Chicago Police Department consistently refused to be adequate and professional in their handling of Hispanic so it seems that she continued to conduct a revitalization process People, it's just that something. What happened was, C.B. came across the black. Suddenly they heard somebody who's articulate. The news talking about. And the first place, the appointees all but nine or political appointees. Many of the investigators are wedded to or related to police members of the Chicago Police Department. A lot of people, black people, have felt so alone. We've been bossed by Sunday. he is seeing not that bright, they don't know that much in hero. They are watching him standing there between J. Brown and Richard M. Bayley, the son. Soku, so well-reared that people  people just three, it was  watching Michael Jordan be the best. The surprise act unfortunately at the behest of this mayor, as a minion of this mayor, as a sublater of this mayor, as a subordinate of this mayor. the story of this kind of love. How are you on your words that even somebody journalists, why journalists have to scratch their head and go to addiction. Black people love that and he jumped on day and burned took her about surprise shock her she was still reading from the shock I should never forget it. See this man got this. He's here. There's some way that being a black candidate from this is different from being a white candidate. If you're black, you get thrown into the chasm of misunderstanding, but it's way to merit black and error. And the way that white politicians are must never are. Two Americas simply see certain things differently. Princess, what should I read Washington say about the late mayor Richard J. Daley, many white chit patents still held them off, while black and Latino Chicago for good reasons. How to different. Daily openly stood against integration, this is neighborhoods. And after Martin Luther King Jr. staff, he ordered police to shoot kill rioters. He's a harrowed site. When he says that he would hope that I would have all the good policies of past Mayors, there are no good policies of past Mayors. He had none. None. None. None. None. None. I was late mayor, I regret any one die. I have no regrets about him leaving. He was a racist from the court. Here's the tool and hip to hip. There's no change in the style of violence. And he's viewed and far and oppressed black people to the border to the front of the woman. That was the way they were supposed to be. Just  some things on the planet, he thought that was the way they supposed to be. It was just  everything else he did and said it was a historic. I know when we challenged the late mayor on anything, much less called him that kind of name. And I think that was what made him so provocative. At least what made him so loved by the people who supported him and so hated by the people who wanted to deny him the office. He didn't miss any words. I give no who's honest to a racist. I do I appreciate a respect to a son. If his name were anything up then really, this campaign would be a joke. He has nothing to offer anybody. But a fit up tune can't smile. You'll back around and he runs on the legacy of his name, but in so the common sense in Jesus' name, everything I've forgotten will, I work for it, nobody gave me his name. The former taught him that he could transcend, being the third candidate, being the eyes of Lincoln. and he could take that Adam Powell position. He could take that Marcus Garvey position where you the hybrid between the politician and the public man. And you become somewhere between Muhammad Ali Michael Jackson, somewhere in the superstar. No, the way I may sound abrasive, I have no malestory anybody. I have a job to do. I've got places to go and things to do. And I have proofs to the job, just  in a masterful surgeon and you have to cut out the can. Let me not be blind. Now, now! The dominant coach may have messed up my pocket, but they haven't messed up my hair and wanted to. I believe in the powers of redemption, not to be but cannot lead. In the God I worshiped, that he would submit us to the numbers for four hundred years of revenue in this country for four years and suffer the indignities which we have suffered. How time at the time, high up to high and through heavy is almost... open the back of one of the most powerful people in this world. I can't believe there is no redemption. But that redemption is not going to come out in hatred. It's going to come out in poverty and attitude toward our fellow men. We've come into the 1980s with an understanding that we have not just a right but a responsibility to give the best that we have to with society. We want to give it. We've got to give it to Peter McCrom. He has knocked him down and let them take it. We're going to give it to him. During the selection, and during Harold Washington's terms of smair. In Chicago, every day is the day after the Hilljay bird. Every day was the day when black and white Chicago took a look at the same set of facts and due to different questions. Princess, when the media raised questions about Washington's past, they made white shit highlights, questions about location's prophecy, but it made minority voters more loyal. In 1984, a freeman. There are no scunners. Nine of five to the black people have heard of. What happened was the white power structure immediately. First, criticize her for having been convicted of a tax launch and failed to find it. We should be precise that this was not had. Hey, let's see how it happened. And it's on the turn, that's right. He paid with holes. Right. It was nothing to it. What did you do, man? But the point here, we'll listen to her. It gave him publicity. The other way I was not a god. Many people in the black community invented criticism from being leveled against it. And he was not a god. And he was not a god. And he was not a god. This is well, you're not mad. You can't be made or it's not mad. You may jam with very married motherly. We may have time for marriage, Jane, time for marriage. We may kidn it, you can sit and go back to his wife. Cannot be viable, politicians, if you're not mad. Here again, there's something that blacks on the custom scene blacks do. He stood up. Ins Flint you're not mad. He's not mad. marked me just notice that통 made mind that one these are not lastly at the ان so it can block the pipe the use we that's the one But he got some more for this one. And quite frankly, you would have to concede. I shouldn't have said that had quite pen it with the same back and run. There's no way in the world, he's been , I think that. This too, you might candidate who been in jail for sailing the pilot tax turn. He wasn't married, roomit being home of sexual labor. Being called around, a club has had a daily conversation simply being at roomit driver. You really play. What do you think of that? What do I think of it? I think it's here. Yeah, and really if it's a softF, I'd  to kind of , man, who's fellow? No, smell that one. No, smell that one. No, smell that one. He was a genius, but his criticisms also go to what the white here was. I wonder, as far as you can tell, what was the, it's a heart of the white here. Look, the coo.. back. So the Tushkaaga's headed primary day. Wai Tushkaaga is ignoring Washington's. Wai Tushkaaga was buzzed back. And when he won, Tushkaaga's had wildly different reactions. And he went to bed. When Raleigh Anderson was a reporter at Tushkaaga's shooting, I mean one of the few blacks that were doing this room. They after her was launched at the primary. And he was set at some. remember, it's feeling, right? It was  somebody's family, love it, and fit down. So many of us just really found it. And we were in this jubilant mood. Except you did not feel comfortable. Express, looking. So we walked around. We did it, we did it. We were birds, somebody's offices. place inside and go , yes! I jump over the down and then come out. Walk around. Yes. We're reporters. Yes, we are just... Yes. Ah. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. After primary day, things got ugly. Usually, when you get democratic primary for mayor and Chicago, means you want the office. Your public and party doesn't count and see elections. But in this case, as Chicago moved for the general election in April the United States. 93. 90% of White Chicago deserted Democratic Party, to vote for Republican named Bernie Appton. One of his campaign slogans, Appton, before it's too late. Black Chicago saw the Democratic petitions races, parents and both. Meanwhile, White Police was circulated hate literature, and the state of the chicken bones and watermelons. And it perhaps the most famous incident in the campaign, while stopping with Walter Mondale, Howard Washington stopped the same pastoral church in the city's White Northwest side. Oh, Terrible Mud. right. My lunch and cup of it. When Harold showed up, press on to ask you that, I mean there was this, I mean this angry, I mean people were approaching the car, I mean there was just people out of control, I mean ever thought that we were in physical. Then we get to the church, somebody spray painted on the church, the feeding, it's a die, never die. On a catheter, yes, FACEVENESe something curious about. Occasionally, Howard Washington wanted his supporters to say, passing something , sorry to turn now. And when they did, he made headlines. White Chicago and mainstream press saw it is more than just ethnic part. It was seem striking. This is one of the ways that being a black politician in America, it's different than Polish politician or Irish politician. Dutch painting. The difference is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, Polish politician is good air. Repolitive. I was trying to get an Irish Mayor, it's good effort politics. But when the Black Shawty got a black mayor, it's racist. Music One Leonard grew up in the White South West Side Chicago in both power washing. I think a lot of people thought that he was going to bring in a lot of people that we're going to be black and we're going to change the city. Now we have our chance. Now let's go ahead. Let's take, let's write all these so-called wrongs, whether they were right or wrong. It's in the story. Let's write these wrongs. Let's move in. Let's take over. Let's have more of a saying, a local government. People just saw that it's a threat. We felt what these people are going to come in. Move into the cornerhouse or whatever. And the other white flight starts again. I think that that was a big share. Chicago will become another Detroit people. Another Cleveland. Everybody values it all. Businesses leave. Many weights had already fled one set of neighborhoods during white play. The glances that white Chicago was used to having the late mayor daily, protected neighborhoods, for instance, by blocking federal schemes to bring in low income public housing or city. And how are Washington would do that? He was going to obviously no longer black these and these low income housing units were coming to every neighborhood in the city or whatever. And that would start the following year of what would it call it in the Far East, in the coming stuff. The Davenal Effect, thank you. This is one thing the Black politicians have to deal with, with the way politicians down. And this is true from Chicago to Washington DC, North Carolina South Africa, and to deal with the way fear. And how much? Yeah, 600 to 7,000 Black British borders in the city. When you get right down to it, the folks are here. Right there here, there here, and every group has served before, I'll see you. and the presentations must have felt when it's every group and gives our persons the publisher around being the robotics plane, they'll have these students to make their own move on in and take one of their own and put them in office. That's what we should do. That's what democracy is all about. What democracy is all about? What democracy is all about? The problem is, when your opponent's downsea election is just the normal work in the democracy. How how are you in fact rise above the fear? Every week at an hour of it? General election took off to the minute way not open To smear can life in our class today in a program story of race in politics in America story of Harold Washington I suppose first black mayor Mayors office in 1983 that just four years later Just a few months into the same term United 30 years ago in the sea So in Chicago and most American big cities the way it is to work and I say you still with some reservations It argued version of the Stills and Slots of this, but the way it used to work was that when Irish Americans took mayor's office, Italian Americans, Polish Americans, the channel contracts, and patronage jobs, and nothing municipal that is to their own communities. We promised one of the key center of movement to elect black men, which, kind of, though, we convened the early organizational meetings in his basement. It is part to imagine that Harold Washington ever come to office without him. He was disappointed by Harold. I don't know But he never became what I would consider the black man. Black people wanted something that was so simple, fairness. I used to get upset with her after he became black because her was too thin. In fact, he would say in his speeches. , I'm gonna be fair. I'm gonna be more than fair. No one! I know one! And you say! No one! Why they knew! I know! You're free from the fang! The Magnificent, the Fangu, and the Fangu! Hey, three of us. When he was safe, I'm not on it, my piece. fair but I'm gonna be fairer than say. , you want to go over with? How old is it? Those of us who are considered radicals, which? simply believe that since nail is the nail is her and all the rest of the white man and always put white people first without any questions without any apology. We said in a herald gap to put black people first, that's what we wanted. I assure we wanted to be two white people, what they were, the black people, he was just ridiculous. But people wanted to see the opportunity to have our community thrive,  other geniuses. It wasn't just Black Nationalists  Lou Palmer from this slide. Old-time machine oil is  Jean Sawyer, who is the black autumn, white democratic machine wanted to. see how it was in asthma. It seemed  it was probably that they would probably to say. I was going to tell you something. I love it. By giving a lot lower, it really about the same thing. Who is expecting to not black for us to be that new? He should have given me all people a little more. Well, and major pro would be a black person in America. What I'm enrolling is you're in this trap. Because I mean, this is sort of our curse and our blood because of this racial history, is that we have been complaining and pointing out all these inequities for a very long time. And therefore, all these things that you have pointed out that have been... and injustice to you, how that you're in power, you can't do because there'd be injustice to white. Therefore, rules have to be this great even everything's fair and square. People close to Harold Washington say that it was smart politics and fair and fair. After all, blackboards and created so and fairly in-pass. In the same services the rest of the city got, the huge step forward, because also the political stance he felt most comfortable with by disposition. In my by politicians or community activist games say, all, trying to get more of a one neighborhood over another, he was so enormously popular in Black Chicago, 85% of Black Electric turned out to be a good one. And why everyone simply referred to one of his hair all, but he could ignore the pressure. Take a Grinch out with the staffers. I think there is a difference between Black Appellation and Black Contest. I think of a part of the Black politicians who was definitely its our turn. And I had to deal with some of these folks that they come in and they want to jobs, crap  that. Right? They're good jobs. But I think of the part of the people. I mean they were interference. I mean I think the fear to sing, play with them. Yeah. I mean they were proud of you. They supported what he was doing. Probably have a Washington talk about danger of doing. to play with your teachers. How can you make the first black mayor weaker than any of his white credit sensors? Publicly, problem-intensive purposes. Teacher, you said. It's gone. It's gone. In the words of Cornel Davis, they said it what did? So I went to a street and I walked around that street and I stomped on that street. And I jumped up and down and I called out patching it, patching it, y'all you lying. And patching it just an answer. It is dead, dead, dead. Washington Tech Machine and Machine struck back. When the first day of Washington's first city council meeting, 29-autumn, all of them white, the old Democratic machine, teamed up to a post. The first time in memory of Chicago Mayor did not control city hall. But the first time in memory, Clop, as we call Chicago, Clop, sheer bullying force the fire of Chicago politics, Clop is in long-green mayor control. It was machines 29 votes, hair ups 21 votes, 29 not only blocked as appointments, and never blocked them up for consideration. The blocked most of his legislative initiatives, dedicated enormous energy to looking for ways to embarrass Florida. It was man. That was so divisive and chaotic that it sustained the animosity and suspicion from Black Chicago and White Chicago for years. It came to be known locally as Council Wars. For a local African American, Carmichael and Aaron Seaman. And stay tuned! teaching moments and local politics as seen from the Star Wars trilogy. How I appeared as a leaf, sky-talker, later with a rebellion, that's me spouting out plong, difficult words. How I was main political opponent, Edward Oliatt, the older man who fled the 29, also got a big part. What are you doing in my office, Lord, does, Edward Oliatt? I'm gonna put both bones in the first chamber. Just sum your past two ASHs flesh up. Alright, we should discuss. Come in, you assign me to a new console. I don't have to talk you. I'm the mayor. I can do whatever I want. I can... I find your lack of respect as to. It is obvious you do not know the power of the cloud. It has served all of the mayor's support. It can bring you great wealth and power or an asteroid as easily, Lord Choice, your world. You do not impersonate me, but only I take this parliamentary maneuver. Well, not me, but I cope with this negotiated majority. And I'm my elicis in court! KOOT! Well the decision is in my favor. OOOT! You may have prevailed in this junkyard videoly, but I will assist you with the pursue your disestablishments. RAAAAAAAHHHHH! Perhaps Mayor, what to do so he was due to the dark side of the cloud. You must make deals and compromises. NEVER! Yes, Mayor, to the feet we you must become me. Look at my face, guy, Tom. or I am your mentor. Nooooooooooooooooooo! Even under these adverse conditions, Washington did manage the past pledges, get some things done. Backwards, final, got the same street-repearing garbage, heat-hubbs, all the other wards. Tech agreement shot describes one scheme, Washington came up with to do some improvements around the city, designed to be a force, fairer, and fairer, to keep every word the same benefits. The 29th of course hosted. Washington needed their approval just to pay for it in the issue city bond So every war it was again I think it was 10 miles of street resurfacing and Alice of certain number of Alice done and street lighting and And so yeah all these on the blind issue and they were refusing to To pass so he put all the reporters on the bus and then and he would go around to his various war we went out to Mount Greenwood another area of the city that does that did not welcome blacks at the time to say, you're all doing it. Is refusing to support this bond issue that I want to use to give you real streets. And if you want it, you better tell your all-demand to vote for it. And somebody time you get through doing this, folks in the communities are pretty much outraged. Black men are not. They want if they're street-thing one of their sewers. They want if they're voted sidewalks, you're pure so forth. What happens to American politics when a politician happens to be violent? In this case, what happens? That everything in city politics has seen through the prison race. Even though often it had nothing to do with race, often it had more to do with the war. Gary Rippland is the author of very e-panded history of Washington's spy reference. , everyone wants to understand how a Washington is the first black mayor, and it's true. It's the first black mayor, and I was at the very same end again. Thank you, but it is also the mayor who beat... Chicago Pluto, Kumbrasheen, he was the first reformer in 30 years to take on the machine. He didn't more successfully than anyone else before I'm purely on a reform point of view. So he was a different kind of politician, but now I can never see beyond his race. In fact, there was a little of a cartoon in the timeline. I loved it. It was an edder asking a reporter covering the election. So anything changed, anything new? And... reporter answered, no, he's still white, he's still black. Really, it was never, it really wasn't that much more sophisticated than that cartoon indicated. We picked up a local tape and he's got just wax or elephant. You don't talk about it. We don't have the slightest idea about it. Don't understand it. He's, you don't understand the bias. Don't understand what push people, all they say, he, that book's nothing. Cheese, black divers, blue, black twie, blue. It must hate  so and I'm gonna do it nothing nothing crazy stuff that's what you read around He's done I also had to put it with him and I look at him for that Oh, I don't know silly business, I'm in a white book that you can work today Wow And this is more you did work What's that new major got us in race color 3rd or 6. Because everything he did, he thinks it would more about reform and about race, he seemed through the lens race, he gave Washington's opponents toward the deities against him, which they did. Typical example. Some primerates went up between 1985 and 2006, even though overall. times lower on the Washington, it's white predecessor. But as opponents tried to make the case, at this coup, the black mayor did not care about a poll. Heat literature would said that he would do nothing about time, because most crimes caused by blacks. So they were using this statistical bump between 8586 to prove what the hate literature was saying, that the black mayor is going to be indifferent to crime. That's plain, that that's plain to raise card and plain dirty. way of the story statistics to play the racial fears out there. So did Washington talk about race, did he talk about Chicago political machine, always being biased against the black community? Sure, that playing the race card. Sure, but also having to think it's true. What he was saying, whereas what I think the opposition was doing much more of was playing the race card and playing in a dirty way. But trying to tweak and abuse the statistics anyway. could to prove their point, planes, the worst fears of the White community. I never so Washington planes, worst fears of black community in fact whose rhetoric was, I'm going to be fair and fair. Packed is by the time you die, just a few months into a second dream about this. Howard Washington put together working majority of the council. Now many more white-svoted form in the second election, in his first. But every political observant of the set that he was making head-wet, Patrick O'Connor was one of 29 holds- He was one of the few swing boats, sometimes sighted with me. We invited him up to a picnic in our wood and he showed up at our picnic and he got a very reception. People that really didn't vote for him and probably would vote for him the next time. Respected the fact that he came out there and wanted to say hello, that he wanted to participate. And bear in mind that I was voting consistently with a block that was voting against him. And he came out and he spent the day in his fight. I remember one time we were both invited to a place that neither of us were particularly popular in the ward. And so I got a call from his office and this is again the time when there was a council ward going down. Asking was I going to this festival and if I was, would I meet Mayor Conor and our ward and go in there together. I too have no way back, Thank you so much Lotus friends toünden! not going on. You must be able to put my house. So the mare pulls up to the front of my house. He comes in. We have glass of wine. We had not hit up here. We sat around for a couple minutes and met my friend. He looks in my dining room. We didn't have any dining room furniture at the time of kids' royal young. We just moved in the house. So he says, this is where you're dining room furniture. This room payment up my hand. And here I'll go to the new desk. was going to cost me something. I mean, and he was just that quick. He was really, very, very good. But my point is, is that we got in the car and went to this festival. By the tiny left, he had people dancing with me. He was, , one over. He, he was talking with folks. By the tiny left, it might not have changed the mind of everybody in there that he was okay. But he made a significant impact. And he understood, by keeping that and going to areas where he was not expected to show up or traditionally not be the most welcome person that he was winning for centuries that people. And that's all he had to do. Printing Jared says that the Washington lived, who would have done a lot to ease the strengths, modern Chicago, the private had. Now was going to win the hope of the shock of the white population. And I'll know what it means. and go coast liberals. They were the gang into blacksmiths. And they could see something in him. They represented him. He was chirping, warm, friendly. And not only that, he was going into some law-coulouse white neighborhoods, reminisce streets pay for the first time. And they were slowly beginning to lose their feet. Back to President and Future. There are ways I think that the marriage changed the city forever, but there are not things you can necessarily measure by doing head counts and using a lot of numbers. What are Washington's phone press secretary? Now, columnism is not a sin of times. Thank you, open up. sitting in ways that will never be closed again. If you look at the numbers, you'll still see a lot of an equity, and you'll still see neighborhoods that are poor, probably poor, then they were 15, 20 years ago. You'll see neighborhoods that still probably don't get their fair share of city services, but you'll see, I think, a dramatic difference in the attitude, the public officials and policymakers have to equity in the city. What are you years after her abortion is now? This is still a messy trip. After how, when people were elected mayor, was Richard M. Dale, the son of Richard Jack. And even he was careful to have black pressure with your ears. And he kept the number of appointees in black administration before him. He should bond, smiling, noddle at the Washington News, getting all of his public sports equal benefits. Some of his unheard of him gave him four Washington. City services are still distributed more fairly, even today. That's not for people in black and Latino neighborhoods plus his, he's currently a Rom man. I'm not listening to them on the biggest issues facing the school's in police. But Emmanuel knows that he's supposed to be listening. He's been careful to put people to color up front. Howard Washington said the bar of all it's , , how to shoot. We first broadcasted his program back in 1997. We ended the story with this quote from Judge Pinsham, about how he was watching his legs. I just happened to be one. again, pastures, deserts. Make heroes out of business. The bare folks can't leave nobody know. He's made Dr. King Holliday. He used the most popular person at the time as death in his nation. The moment he got killed since he came to leave nobody know where he valued his. I don't think they're going to be to get here all the same kind of accolades because he might be too much. That's proud cast in this book in New York. You could have it at right then from the grave Harold Washington was leading these one person. Well actually, God willing, he was at that point running for president in Democratic primaries. When that candidate said, there's no black America or a way to America, there's there's no black America. Here they have his herocraft. in the summary, did he fare the fare? Some of you may know that I originally moved to Chicago in part because the inspiration of Mayor Washington's campaign. And for those of you who were called that era, and were called Chicago at that time, it's hard to forget the sense of possibility that he sparked a peak. We're broke up on a ran for Senate, I'm so pissed off. Thank you, Mayor, for messing us up with the United States State Council Office. Man is uniquely positioned to comment on how racial politics changed in Chicago since Harold's time. This is also a political applies in Harold Washington back in Harold's second month in Maine. Ten years ago when we read Broadcast in the show, a re-stacks the writer in the self-homes talk about that. He was during the Obama campaign, he was on a campaign bus in Iowa. He told me back then that things had significantly changed in Chicago's white words in the years since Harold's death. I remember that the night of the 2004. The Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate were Barack Obama was nominated. And one of the things that I looked at that night was how he did off the North West side of Chicago. , in Harold Brand, he got 8% of the white folks in his first primary. I think he got 20% in the reelection. And much of the determined resistance was on the North West side of Chicago. Obama carried all the one word on the Northwood. the president of Chicago. He even carried the briefing in which the impathable church sits. That was the church where Harold Washington and Walter Mondale campaigned in 1983, and met with really hotbow resistance from the crowd. Obama carried that briefing. I said to Barack that night, I think Harold smiled  down on us tonight. I'm Obama got to general election senator. When 70% of the vote were more in every white city, this is how it's planned for tonight. What happened? Well back then, 10 years ago when the last broadcasts show. We asked one of our colleagues at our home station Chicago Public Radio reported Rob Williamsburg to go find out. We went to some of the boards where Harold Washington was not welcome back in the day. 10, 11, 23rd words. Pocked 50 people. And all but three of them said that they will be willing to vote for a black man today. Be clear, people were openly racist today. I'm not apologetic about that. this guy P. But what if I thought a house here in Hague? And what happened? , smooth dead? Are you gonna over the parks? And over school? I'm taking over everything. Go, go in a holiday to Wolf Lake. Well, who's over there? They're all barbecue and all. We can't even go to our own parks. Got nothing. But then, the same guy said, then they said, the black Alderman. Tony crack on call. Run from Mayor. He said he's going to jump cleaning up high park. But there's a woman in there. Mary K. We lived in the 20th word by me right here, court. They've literally washing, got the lowest vote total in the city in 19th. Less than 1%. There's $199. There it goes, not one. Not. Should I do a reporter rob? Things are just different now. Back then, for me, it was white or black. I was purchased back then, though. More so than I am though. There's still some lingering around. Oh yeah. , don't turn my back on him but yeah. No I mean, there was 20 years ago. I don't have that fear these days. now I accept you a black or white, . And Washington didn't do. Bad. I mean, he was a sister. I would go for Obama as president and these none of you guys. She got a chance to record two dozen salmon. So what's changed? Everything. I mean, I've changed, they've changed. But when people are more educated, they're, , they're in-runs of the new thing. They've come a long way into the food. They deserve, , they work hard. Are you seeing the stores? , they're, , they're doing the... They're well dressed. They're, , they're clean. They're not the get-als. They've come out and get up. They want what we got. But we've always had. And so what's you take on that? Is that good or bad? That's good. Cut. Don't say anybody that's willing to work for what they get to serve today. They get served. You want it? You want it? You want it? And you go for it? And you want it to work? , you're supposed to ask. And you go for it? When I asked the people who reached Howard Washington, random first place, it's in the pond right in the cloud. For the rest of the Washington side, the rest had the same thing. I thought about how it was a mistake to think, we'd make the world change to be in the hooks and just one man. That's how I died, moving down to. And I tell you, not a people don't  criticize her or I blame her or for this. Here else it is. But should have been happening, we should have anticipated either his demise or removed off and been organized for that possibility. How was put on a pedestal? And I think that was amazing. We left it in almost God's status. Barack Obama, and that's the same problem. That is passage in dreams to my father. In the right's my Chicago. immediately after parents death. The day before Thanksgiving, Harold Washington died, is a bomb meeting. It occurred without warning, subtle, simple, final, almost ridiculous in its ordinaries, a hard of an overweight man giving away. It rained that weekend, cold and steady. Indoor is an outside people pride. By the time of the funeral, Washington loyalists worked through the initial shot. began to meet, regroup, trying to decide on a strategy for maintaining control, trying to select Harold's rightful air, but it was too late for that. There was no political organization in place, no clearly defined principles to follow. The entire Black politics had centered on one man who radiated  the sun. Now that he was gone, no one could agree on what that presence had meant. It's a thing of course that this is what so many Democrats are saying this year. That's it. the Barack Obama's and the Donald Trump's and Howard. He's a Democratic party, he's not in the slowest sense. I checked in with the Obama and Washington's campaign advisor, David Maxwell, this week. He's going to be Harold might've been surprised by the fact that black man was surprised just two decades in the current few seconds from him. But he would not have been surprised back last.
