There's a story where all the crucial action takes place, but then just a short fight drive from the spot where I speak to you from right now. Here in Chicago. The setting? A summer? Much  the one we're living through even as I speak. On this humid midwestern day. It's these a fiction? We'll see. really great distinction actually. By right-or-name Stuart Dibet, we didn't. We didn't in the light, we didn't in darkness. We didn't in the fresh cut summer grass, we're in the mountains of autumn leaves. For in the snow we're moonlight, three down our shadows. We didn't in your room on the canopy, we slept in. The bed you'd slept in as a child. We're in the back seat of my father's rusted rambler. We smelled the smoke to child's until boss said that he delivered and weekends for my uncle Vincent's meat market. We didn't. in your mother's view at eight, for a rosary, find the rear of your mirror. But you did black sneak, silver, cruciform, pangs. And the subining paragraph story, Dive at Castalette in H. Thousands of words, describing all of the things that two people can do when they're not using something. Turns out that not doing something, this every bit is vivid and complicated in experience as doing something. But my friend, where are the stories of the things that we do when we're not doing the thing itself? Well, we bring those to you today, right here. Part of our ongoing quest to document our actual guys in this country, WVEsis Shakago, Public Radio International, It's a American life, I'm our regardless. And we're going to ask you a question which is Dean today. show. We didn't. Back one, you come and go, the waiters remain in which we hear a few words from the DH-larence not doing it. Back two, dance. Scientists have a investigation by Mr. Danny Hot, but what exactly is happening between two people? Step by step, moment by moment, when they're not following them. Back three, same time next year, a couple nearly gets together. But does not? And then, an uncanny coincidence intervenes as in a fate, as in a dream, as in a movie. But what does it mean? Or, saying no for 75 years. Story of what happens when you say no to exactly the wrong person at the wrong time. And if anyone knew that, it would be a prison. Say with us, don't say no now. At one, you come and go, waiters remain. We begin today's program with this story. It's a part story, part philosophical inquiry to the nature of not doing things. In Jetfire. For years I wanted to write book by DH Lawrence, a homage to the writer who'd made me into become a writing. There was a cherished ambition, and as part of my preparation for realizing this cherished I avoided reading anything about it. So that at some point in the future I could go back to him. If not a fresh, then at least not rock-stained. Then, after years of avoiding lines, I moved into the phase of what might be termed creed preparation. I visited Eastwood, Spurthwoods, I read biographers, I mastered a board of photographs which I caught in the once-new docking wallet, blue, which I had written, DHL, photos, and termed black and I even built up an impressive... at notes with Lawrence vaguely in mind. But these notes, obviously, know, actually served not to prepare for and facilitate the writing of a book about Lawrence, but to defer and postpone doing so. There's nothing unusual about this. All over the world people are taking notes as a way of the spoon putting off and standing in the form. My case was more extreme, but not only was taking notes about Lawrence, where putting off writing a study of, and homage to the writer who made me want to. a camera ratter. At this study I was putting off writing, was itself a way of putting off into spawning and another. Although I've made up my mind right before that longs, I'd also made up my mind right in the novel. Right in both at the same time, it's inconceivable. And so, these two equally overwhelming ambitions, first, wore each other down, and then wiped each other around. I thought about working on the novel, I felt a thinking that would be much more enjoyable into writing a study of Lawrence. As soon as I started making notes and lines, I realised I was probably sabotaging forever any chance of writing my novel, which, more than any other book I'd written, had to be written immediately, for another protracted by the label came between me and the idea for what I could see as a rambling, sub-bernhardy and rant them. It was now a net. So I went for making notes and lines. making notes to my novel, by which I mean I went from not working on my book about the ones to not working on the novel, because all of this two in improving and note taking actually meant I never did any work on either book. All ideas were switched between to empty patterns in my computer, one can be meant we called C, Access, DHL. You have a C, Access novel. And said myself, pinging back and forth between them until after an hour and a half of this, I would turn off the confusion. because the worst thing of all I knew was to wear myself out in this way. The best thing was to do nothing to sit calmly, but I was no car and of course, instead I thought totally desolate, because I realized that I was going to write neither my study of DH Lawrence nor my novel. One of the reasons that it was impossible to get starting neither the Lawrence or the Orwin was because I was so preoccupied. but where to live. I could live anywhere, though I know constraints on me, and because of this it was impossible to choose. It's easy to make choices when you have things hampering. Job, kids' screws, but when all you have to go on is your own designs, and life becomes considerably murdered but not to say intolerably. Even money wasn't an issue since at this stage I was living in Paris and no work could have been more expensive in Paris. The exchange rate got worse by me. Paris became more expensive by the moment. What the money situation in Paris did was to emphasise that although I had settled in Paris really I just didn't pass in through. Streamly slowly. That is all anyone in the Shore American can do in Paris. Past through. You may spend 10 years passing through but essentially you're still a sightseeing, but tourists, you come and go. The waiters remain. The longer I stayed, the more powerful it became, this feeling that I was just passing through. I thought about subscribing to the cable channel, Blue's, was a way of making myself feel more settled. But what was the point in subscribing to canal Blue's when and all probability, would be moving on in a few months? Obviously, the way to make myself more settled was to require some of the trappings of permanence. The never seemed any point acquiring the aptly named trappings of permanence. when in a couple of months I might be moving on, might well be moving on, we're almost certainly be moving on. Because there was nothing to keep me where I was. Had I acquired some of the trappings of permanence, I might have stayed put, but I never acquired any of the trappings of permanence because I knew that the moment this trappings had been acquired, I would be seized with a desire to leave to move on, and I would then have to free myself from these trappings. And so, lacking any of the trappings of permanence, I was perpetually on the... the brink potential departure. That was the only way I could remain anywhere to be constantly on the brink, not of actual, but of potential departure. These were all issues intended to address in different ways either in mediated form, in my study of learns, or directly in my novel. It was by first. But there was an additional practical complication too. Since I was obliged to spend a certain amount of time away, from wherever I live, and since the rent on my Paris apartment is so high, and because of the exchange rate is becoming higher every month, I was frequently obliged to sublet it, strictly speaking, to sub-sublet it, since I was subletting it myself. And since, if you are subletting your apartment, you do not want to acquire too many valuable or personal items which might get destroyed, but then comes about that you yourself are living in conditions arranged primarily for those subletting from you. It's basically your subletting. in from yourself. That's what I was doing, subletting from myself, strict and speaking, sub-subletting, living in a part with the void of anything that might have made it my apartment in the sense of my home. I conspired to arrange for myself the worst of all possible worlds, and my days were spent in this unbreakable circle of anxiety, always going over the same ground, again and again, always with some new variable, but never with any change. I had to do something to break this circle and so I decided to sign a contract that would make me the official tenon as opposed to the illegal sub tenon. I wasn't even sure that I wanted to stay in the apartment, but I'd actually been extremely unhappy for 90% of my stay. For 90% of my stay had been dominated by anxiety about A, where I was going to stay and P, where I was going to start a novel all start my study at last. But as soon as the managing agent said that they were unwilling to let the place to move, a foreigner with no drop and no steady income, had became convinced that I had to stay in this apartment right actually being sublimely happy, that there was in fact nowhere else on earth where I could hope to be as content. Eventually, by rich friend, Irve Long, Manning, Zalat Gorten, agreed to stand as Galantyr. Managing agents were lentil, and I signed the list that made me do a push. I was ecstatic for about five weeks. Then I realized I'd taken on an awesome, not to say, crippling responsibility. And far from solving the problem, I'd actually put a lid on so that now my uncertainty was boiling away and the pressure threatened to blow me apart. The one thing I could be sure is that I've had to leave this apartment right never known a moment's piece of mind as soon as possible. I stayed here, the sawman, I'd failed to write both my novel and my study at Lawrence. That much was obvious. Round and round I went, making no progress, resolving one thing one moment in another the next. I wrote to the agents an officially renounced the map, claiming that professional reasons had obliged me to return to England. The agents wrote back acknowledging my decision to leave the apartment. I wrote back saying that professional. or reasons now obliged me to remain in pounds, could I therefore unrenounce more? Relieved to be free of the trouble of re-letting it, the agents agreed to let you remain in the apartment which I just announced. And so it went on, I wrote again to renounce the apartment definitively, he sent to somewhat creative knowledge into my decision. I wrote that, changing my definitive decision to leave to a definitive decision to stay, but it was too late. I had to leave. Now that I did have to leave, I was faced with a terrible prospect of having nowhere to live, but having to decide where to live without delay, and only then did I realize how much this apartment meant to me, how it had actually become my home. Although I believed that I'd hardly any of my things in this apartment, there were actually many of my own things that I now had to find a place for. Over the years, I'd actually acquired quite a few of them. trackings of permanence, a even owned surprise and mud furniture, some of it rather nice. Where was I going to store it? And what about me? Where was I going to store myself? Rome was a possibility. Lara might almost lie at a lovely apartment in Rome and was always arguing they've lived our second name. I've threatened and wondered, why was I even preparing that this? I was mad not to go to Rome. Rome was in Italy. The country where the lorances had spent more time. the name of the house. If I was to stand any chance of making any progress with my study of Lawrence, probably the very best place I could do. As soon as I arrived I knew I'd made the right decision. My mind was made up, I was ready to begin my study of DH Lawrence. The only trouble was the heat. The heat was tremendous, nowhere in Rome as hotter than now as a part. Even the light was hot. We tried to keep the light at bay, but it drilled through the keyhole, squeezed under the door, leaving it open the smallest cracks in the shuttles. My mind was made up, I was ready to work, but it was too hot to work. It was so hot we spent our waking hours dosing and our sleeping hours lying away, trying to sleep. We were in a picnic trunks. The perfect line, the perfect lie, is one which prevents you from doing that which you would ideally, pain-diss, written unpublishedable poetry, but which in fact  which to do. People need to feel they've been thwarted by circumstances in pursuing the life which had they let it, they would not thwart it. Whereas the life they really want is precisely a compound of all those thwarting circumstances. It's a very elaborate, extremely simple procedure, the rain. engine is where we have self-deceived, contriving to convince yourself that you are prevented from doing what you want. Most people don't want what they want. People want to be prevented, restricted. The hamster not only loves his cage, he'd be lost with IIT. That's my children so convening. You have children because you're struggling to get I as an artist or failing to get on with your career. Then you can persuade yourself that your children prevented you from having this career that never looked. night working night. And so it goes on, things are always forsaken in the name of an obligation to someone else, never as a failing, falling short of yourself. I've devoted more of my life to thoughts of giving up in anyone else I can think of. Nature wrote that the thought of suicide got him through many a bad night, and thinking of giving up is probably the one thing that's kept me going. I think about it when I take basis but always come up against the problem of what to do when I give them. Give up one thing and you immediately obliged to do something else. That's suppose, for example, that I decided to call it a day, to give up, to abandon any attempt, not just at earning a living, but at having a lung. What then? What would happen next? Within five minutes I'd be thinking about listening to music and would put a CD on this stereo. Five minutes after that, I'd be up again because I would have grown. I'd add up with that piece of music in the sky in the shelves and shelves of CDs, searching in vain for a piece of music that was not heartless, I think into myself that if I had more CDs, there would surely be one that I would  to listen to. And before I knew it, I'd be out of the house and on my way to the Megastore, looking for a new CD. Should anyone flatter us by asking what we're looking for? What we're searching for? Demi. We think immediately, almost instinctive, and vast turns, long, fulfilled, and love. But our lives are actually made up of lots of tiny searches, things  a CD we are not sick of. An adept print edition of Phoenix, a picture of Lawrence that I saw when I was 17. Another identical pair of swayed shoes to the ones that I'm wearing there. Had them together, these little things make up an epic quest, more than enough for one mountain. thinking specifically at the search for CDs, that's assumed that after deciding to give up, after sitting around listening to CDs and going out via a new CD, I found a CD I liked the idea of listening to. Still, at some point, I would not simply grow tired of listening to this new CD, but would actually become hardly sick of the idea of listening to CDs. And would think to myself that sitting around listening to CDs is a much more enjoyable inactivity. A much more enjoyable inactivity. If it is a relief and something else, anything is. And so, I would resign myself to picking up my pen and try and once again, if for no other reason than to render listening to my CDs a little less disparity, to make some progress within the study, DH longs. When will another we all have to write our studies of DH longs, even if they will never be published. Even if we were never completely, even if all we are left with after years and years of effort, there's none finished unfinished or record of how we failed to live up to our own earlier ambitions. Still, we all have to try to make some progress with our cooks about DH Lawrence. The world over, in Towers to Tarmine, in the places we have visited to come to us, we will never set foot in. The best we can do is to try to make some progress with our studies of DH Lawrence. Jeff Tire, reading an exept, amazing little book out of sheer rage, just so the author of Paris Trans and quite beautiful, I hope that you guys. We have this from Danny Hot. As he tells this story on stage, he glimpsed back and forth across the stage. Hi, how are you doing? Excuse me. So nice to meet you. So what's your name? My name is Victor. Nice to meet you.

Danny Hock, a series from your friend man showed Jail's, Haskot, isn't hip hop. CDs are to show our available at his website www.dannyhock.nage.com Coming up, making a deal with the prosecutor with the prosecutor's name 25 years in prison, and not make. in the deal means 75 years why you might see no 25 years and other stories what we do when we don't do something that's a minute how about getting emotional we not problem things king American Life Market classification the we've got three next year. This is the story of a couple that did not fall in love, did not get together, did not fall in the future, and some other step at all, he clears the story in folds. It all begins simply now, in the end of March of 13, Dornian Kortin, and she does Madison Square Garden, by tickets to the Robone Stones, Tattoo, Yut, and the Red Waves. And she stands in line with a few 21 row, three hours, and they get to the parking, and , the parking is the one. So we go and get our tickets, and the way we did the system is completely... randomized. And so he was right behind me in line or right in front of me, but I ended up getting much better seats than he did. So basically, , we made this deal that we would go to the concert together and sell his pair and split the light. Do you remember what exactly was packed in? I mean, , I was a teenage girl who's this really cute guy thing attention,  what wouldn't have been attracting that. So it's raining, we share a cab up town. I'm going back to school. I'd  to take him the morning off. I'm trying to catch my English class. And we start kissing back of the taxi. And I've raised tampering down in its chest. It's  the movies. It's just couldn't be more romantic. I'm feeling so grown up at this point. Just thrilled. So I go back to school and I'm all excited. Woo, woo, woo. That I tell my friends. And what my friends can give me this look? he's how old, , he doesn't what? He's an out of work actor,  , when I was , no, no, he's really crazy. I love how he's an out of work actor is it's turn off even if you're 13. even if you're in junior high school, he's done , oh yeah, out of work actor. Attitude. So okay, so your friends are skinned. Yes, yes they are. And it was weird because we, , I wouldn't go to his house. I didn't really want him to be in my house. To meet in public places, have these long intents involved conversations. Instead of instead making out. Yeah, basically. Trying to place up, using the energy that could be devoted to it. Well, but I was very serious. I was very excited to be, , , me for my mind. But we had this connection, but it wasn't about that. But , and so, but but finally, , it got a little, , this, dej. I was a special side girl, sticky in my last encounter with him was just uncomfortable. , the fact was he was 21. I was 14. I wasn't going to go to his house alone. And that was pretty much a deal breaker. Okay, it's about 12 years later. I'm back in New York City, person family stuff. I'm wandering through the sense of park. I only have anything to do that night. And it's suddenly I get this flash and the summer is  a bottle. I'm going to talk Shakespeare in the part. So I wander over to the delicate and there's this endless endless line. It's just huge and I get all the way on the end of it and it's clear to me that I'm not going to get in. And so I come up with this seed to cut to the front of the wall. So I go from the end to the floor. Right. And I see this really, really, really cute guy. Pull the exact same line cutting floor that I did. The exact same thing. And he's really cute and so I kind of catches eye. And ... I walk over and I say, , do do the exact same thing. And you guys, yeah, I don't know why I'm going to wait some minute. It's great. So we start chatting, he's got a blanket, I've got some fruit. We're chatting in an eating way. Perfectly comfortable conversation. He asked me my name, I tell him who tells me his name. And then he tells me. last name and I recognize, I can't not recognize it because his name was always really incredible for me. His name is  synonym for Malinab. But he pronounces it differently and it just always made me really uncomfortable when I was 14. I pause my heart start pounding when Malinab fries up and I say over 12 years. down. You and I picked each other up in mind, Rolling Stones. And who stared at me and he totally knows why I am. His jaw drops, , completely remembers. He can't believe it. I can't believe it. And I mean, it's just so romantic. what could be more romantic? Or is Central Park or on a blanket? We're about to go to Shakespeare New Park. It's  it's destiny. So, so, oh my god, end the play. All's well that ends well. So, it's awesome, bro. So I can meet together, it's all magical. It is. It is. Oh, it just could not be more perfect. I'm thinking, this is the story. Tell the grandchild. I love romantic comedies. I mean, I write romantic comedies. It's just  this is what happens in the movies. I'm so excited and we see the play. I will leave and we walk back to his place. And then  the sleigh's back of  this 21-year-old who dated this 14-year-old starts to rure its head. what was this guy doing? Dating me when I was 48. that's not acceptable. I mean the chip-offs there were just so many little things I can go back as apartments, but it was really this mess. Oh he seemed  he was kind of a part head. He was smoking up the whole time, he was growing meat, I'm spoutin' he,  he was constantly smoking out. And he's still an out of work after? Yeah, he hadn't really done much with himself. Since he was, because when he's at kind of coincidence, he's a little grunny, and , you think about him after he was just a young. That's your chance to romantic, but it could be just needs a chance that that exact incident's been so kind of. Yeah, yeah, in case you didn't learn that. less and less. So it just got up here. I left eventually. And then, , he called me randomly drunk at 11 30 at night from some bar. And I was , what do you do? And so this whole thing stayed in the we didn't stay. She just just never went forward out of who didn't. It was sort of  you were reunited to be experienced. They needed. Yeah. I mean, I First, it seemed  there was this big cosmic thing keeping us apart in no age. I mean, there's so few things to actually keep couples apart anymore. what I mean? , I write romantic comedies and it's really hard to come up with a reason. The people don't just jump into bed in the first 20 minutes. Oh, comma, are you serious? Yeah, it's hard. Sure. When you're doing the whole, , it's kismet and we know that they're meant to be, it's yeah, sure. That's hard. To sustain dramatically, that's why most romantic comedies are so boring, ? It is not. in the P.M.O.P. It's , oh, he's engaged to some other girl who's really stuck up and comes from this rich family and we know that he's never going to end up with the stuck up girl. Right. She knows what I mean, but  they go through the motions of  he has to figure it out that she's not right for him. what I mean? That's why , most romantic comedies are so mid-lit and why it's really hard to make a good one. So, so we had that. We had age. ,  it was pretty dramatic. , it was very real. That. How surprised would you sing about Romance? But I guess when I mean what I say is hard now, I mean compared to  the head-a of Hollywood and you think of the classic romantic comedies, those were written under the Hayesco and you could not actually put on your bed together unless they were married. And so it was an obstacle in that very direct obvious way. We needed to answer approval. and you need to be at the same class and all of that. And now, with sexual immorality of change, that's really the thing. It's , well, what's stopping us to keep people in bed? But what you're saying somehow is that, is that we, as a people, spend less time in the realm of we didn't, than we used to, two generations ago. Yeah, I think that we spent time in, I wish we didn't. I wish we hadn't. And then these people actually. get involved with them regret it. Yeah sure I mean that's really the story now. I mean Mark's a screenwriter in Los Angeles. I say good bye. I quote, saying no for 75 years. Most of us, the stakes have not been doing something many good and day are so well that as soon as the moment of decision passes, and everything else doesn't even mean to as memory. Sometimes, the stakes are so staggeringly high, we spend the rest of our lives in the shadow of that one decision, of one no, no, said it exactly the wrong number, exactly the wrong person. Skipigira is a journalist who's come but onto a story exactly  that. Better than in Vincent's Bogen. I met Vincent's 18 years ago on use 15. When he was about to become a freshman, yeah, Bobbin High School, Baldwin is just a coincidence, same as his name. Bobbin was a high school on Charles Southwest side. At the time of his all-white, and Vincent was going to be one of the first black hands to go to the school. I wanted to write a story from the Chicago reader about what it would be  for a black kid to come to that high school. So I wrote the bus with him once September day in 1981 and followed him during his first day. But kind of kid was he that. Vincent had just come off of the previous spring here the name was the most dedicated student in the six grade class 150. dollars. He wanted to be an architect and he was just a nice kid. He had a father who worked as well. His mother had been killed in the car accident a couple of years before. And he was a kind of kid who cuts the grass and sprinkles along. I wasn't the greatest student, but he did graduate. So when did you hear from that? How many years passed? I think it was in 1998, 9 months as I had . and I'm trying to attribute that caught my eye and set something  an armbrailer get 75 years which is a really long time for something to be. Our problem, and I read the story and it said Vincent Bogun had been charged in the 17 in our drawings, committed in the 6th of period in 1928. So, I'm done, this is Vincent. and through our road about and I decided to find out more about it. What had happened in the thunder is that while Vincent was in high school, his father was laid off from his job as a router, started dealing with a cane in the house. He got Vincent's family business, telling after that he died. Vincent became addicted to cooking, stole the school's hand in his car. There's not enough for the deal, but the states are turning a typical kind of deal, American court's plan. If he would admit that he is guilty, now 17. counts while I'm blabbering, which would make a full trial unnecessary, if  trial, then you get a 25% of your sentence. This is called as anybody watches cop shows on to the movies. Cop in the plea, you can plead barge. And this is what Vincent said no. Said no one away that changed his life forever. Said no against the advice of everybody in his life. He wanted to get a trial. His lawyer said it was in stake to try to convince Vincent to take the deal. Said Vincent, you're going to get hammered. You're going to try. will get much more than 25 years. We went to Kyle on one of the 17 counts of land robbery, which had to give him the maximum sense, for the years. He still had 16 counts left, 16 times. At some point, he may have been just before sentencing. The state came to Vincent again and said, please guilty of all the rest of the years. And we'll give you just a total of 3. Vincent again said, no, I want to go to trial. So he went to trial a second time. Got found guilty again in the injured. And got sensed. another third. After that, we went to trial again that 15 years in total of 275. We went to trial again that 60 years, though in one of those weird legal things that we had to variable the sense that we could be outside of the court system. He serves the 60 at the same time as he serves the 75. Basically the idea is that if he overturns one of his conviction someday on PO, he still has to serve tons of time. This was in a settlement, a month ago. So much time, the state simply dropped the other 13 counts against him. Why, Bob? Be wait to his old man. The day the judge gave Vincent the second 30 years, he also sentenced another defendant in his courtroom for murdering two people to 60 years. This defendant had a strangled one person with telephone court and stabbed the other person's 21 times. He got the same 60 years at Vincent had a death. at one. The difference was the murder,  guilt. Vincent at the time had found Jesus in the jail. I think he felt that Jesus might help him win some of his cases. And I also feel he was, he didn't  the idea of we built a pleading guilty to some crimes that you had done. Even though he didn't many of his crimes didn't end and end and end. Now you've written about this for the Alicia Patterson Quarter and just a few weeks ago you went down to Joeyette where Vincent is in a maximum speed present and you talk to him about why he said no to the plea bargains, why he said no to the deal for 25 years. How old are you at this time? At that moment I was 21. So what was going through your head? It was so many things going through my head I can't believe. know, well as the synthesis and so I was looking at 20 value years, half of that time would be 12 and half years. We're taking today, good time, 25 inches served 12 and half of that opportunity. I couldn't really see 12 and half years in my life, , going back without me, , couldn't have fight, , I wouldn't try to be, I'm trying to, I'm playing for my life. , without that particular time I was 21 years old. I couldn't remember that 12 and half years, . I believe that the Lord is... it's just my heart, . Would that write me not say this, this not meant me, . And that was the strong motivation of my part. My family did not understand my turn to be an understander with. I felt  that's where I was being laid at that time. And I was doing it for  that was through the way that you were doing it. And so as well as not cutting out to these parts. Why did you think that? You were guilty of some of these our brothers. Right. So why do you think that Jesus wanted you to go to trial? Where I don't think it was simply. that he won't be able to go to trial. But I felt secure and whatever I did, whatever decision I made after that Lord would be with me. And I don't believe it. I know I didn't put me in a lead, but I know this that I learned in your series less. I see it's  lesson. I've been in a massive security and potentially in the... If I were to the cop, I would only strike to the medium, steer the penalty. I'd never would have seen the walls of these countries. I believe that in my particular case, I needed that. I need to know the crabs that they can call for this particular punishment for a long period of time. And the Quartz here in the Middle East is in the cup of tax. Well, it's not an official term, but it's one that everyone down at 26th Street in Cook County at the courthouse recognizes. And what it is is a penalty for inserting the right to try. In other words, if you're offered a certain number of years, you decide to take a trial. And you get found that most likely you're going to get more time new one. And if you're a plug, it seems to make sense on the surface based because it didn't have that kind of an incentive. Everybody would be going to try and taking a chance and getting found innocent. And with a huge number of cases to be over, of course, could not pass the deal. There's a deal with the end very close. They need to take place. Well, last year in Cook County, just under 40,000 cases, we're disposed of a fire and jury revenge. And we're complete. About 33,000 rooms were disposed of fire and police. I might add that the tax is usually greater than the system in jury trials than the defense trial. In the defense trial in judge decides whether you're guilty or innocent. A jury trial takes a lot longer because you have to pick a jury. You have to instruct the jury. To him. To the lab. to make sure that certain evidence does not appear before the jury. So jury trials are their annusence from the system. I'm going to take up a lot of time. So if you go to trial and you insist on a jury trial, likely to get a little bit more time if you're convicted than if you just had a bench trial. So last year, since I set 33,000 please, of the other 7,000 cases that were about 6,300. bench trials and we there were just under 400 jury trials, less than one percent cases that were disposed to in Cork County, disposed to stranger. And is it necessarily a bad thing? Well I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bad thing. It just goes depends on your philosophy. If you believe, if you feel that the criminal justice system is healthy way to deal with, behavior that. we don't condone. You probably would be in favor of the test because it allows the criminal justice system to work and to work even if it has rising casings. If you feel that society may need to look for other ways to dissuade people from participating in activity that we don't condone, then you probably think that we should do the radical thing and provide by the Constitution, especially the six Taiwanese médias, but actually, Bhavada, I'm not a crime centre that my apologies. to a jury trial. And that's a rate that's not supposed to be fed or by a tax or a punishment if you assert that right. And in the instance case, the TS for a jury trial is even getting benched trying to jury trial. So all of these jury trials, right? And where it's, it's a particular nuisance from course. This case is taking off a lot of time. How many days have we talked about? It's not that many days. It's probably the day to pick the jury in the day or it's in the trial. But it's a... judging that courtroom, but it disposed many cases in the time that we have victories for instances. In that courtroom, afterwards some of the regular lawyers, lawyers, the sign of the courtroom, talked about some of the prosecutors who talked to the public defenders and warn them that you don't want your client to get boggantarized, and both of them as after being enlisted. At Constable Ward five, guests are both normal employees here to demonstrate dignity, they consider a free and family public certificate, and public aware of the rules that go against watching all the first Americans who are involving criminal and death threats and not committing killing OKs and political updates to cause a problem. And those officials who in capabilities are right to try. When I really, , look back at, okay, you all can be 25 years. And then some shit that's it. , then I said, okay, if I were to, , I don't know, God meant that even a better blessing for me. And it's still for me to take that one. Oh yeah, I'm never going to return on my ship under optimization, but ever sure. They have been able to see the things I'm doing in this country. My faith has been even stronger in the Lord is from that point. But I don't know. And but I know the God, and I know that all things work together for the good. I know the Lord and God for the good. That's how I look in it this is me. And this is what's been happening with you. It's  he's throwing himself into a kind of mom pure fatal disease. , whatever will happen will happen. I think that's right. I think the same kind of data was in the evidence of the rotten disease that I'm going to be. I'm convinced that he wanted to be caught. He did get caught last day after pulling $300 in a row. part in the afternoon wasn't wearing mask. It was not intelligent work, it was not ungrubbered. It was an ungrubbered festival and it was trying to do it. But I think that there was an element in Vincent that wanted me to do it. And I had to do in much psychologists. I'm certain, that's who he's mom-dad, is wearing. My brother Nina prescribes with class lines, Exactly how a husband doing what he's doing in a certain in all of your talks , he ever said that that he felt  he was No, I guess he was not there He said it was relief on his car I thank God for watching you Romans 13 This Nicholas got those lines. Oh, it was I believe We have to be right. Just to get back to the way the heat explains to yourself what happened. If you think about somebody who made one decision at 21 who said no at 21 once essentially 4 times in crap it's a session and then has to live with up to the next 30-none year. , now that he's had a decade to think about it, seems  there are only two ways to come to him. To think about it, one is, I mean a terrible mistake and just be racked by that. Or the other, , there was a reason to must be a reason. In this case, , God answers you. And that will just accept that in the forward. And in the way it's so much healthy or more... life is a human belief that there must be a reason to this right now this way. Yeah, I think that Vincent is remarkably healthy person now. Right, healthy, I mean, he's really adapting to his destiny. That doesn't mean that this is a successful belief. I think it's tragic, it's mind-boggling to take a look. Someone spend... the next from decades in prison who really doesn't even be Vincent went into prison very quickly started to be positive things he's never been any discipline problems at all in prison the season was been a concern he's been who's worked as a photographer and editor of such earrings of programmed worked jobs, he went to school. He's a painter, he does well paintings, mostly a classic cars, and he's very good at. Vincent was back on the right track, within probably in your own team. And I don't think it was because he had a 75 year son, saying that he didn't understand. If he had just 12 and a half years home probably doesn't think it may have been regardless of what they're doing. more than he said. He needed some time out and most guys don't do positive time  this and there's no doubt in my mind that this and could have come out a few years ago and got in the job and been a productive citizen. I was bubbly when they opened me and it's really out of ignorance. I don't know what. And the Wad didn't see the need to cut up with a 20-pray use, but that didn't. , now if I was offered that cut up to date, of course that's it. Even if I'm not played in Geltel this 17, of course. , even though they can never have it. I'm not playing in Geltel. I'm not playing in Geltel. I'm not playing in Geltel. Steeper gear, working on a... book about a year in a courtroom who in Chicago, then spelled them 75 years sentence probably last 37 and half years, because it's been heavier, good out around the year 2025, nearly 60 years old.
