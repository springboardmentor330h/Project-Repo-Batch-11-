  "text": "People really were different back in the 60s. Here is something that it is impossible to imagine any politician saying today. Many successful mainstream big time politicians in any way. Listen to the present of the United States June 4, 1965. Perhaps most important is the breakdown of the Negro family structure. For this most of all, white America must accept this. In 1965, Black single mothers became a national political issue, a national symbol, for the very first time, and it was the Democrats who put the issue on the table. A young assistant secretary of labor named Daniel Patrick Moyne-Hann, submitted a report to President Lyndon Johnson, calling for national action, to do something about the large number of Black single mothers. The President's men grew up in homes without strong mail authority. The report said it leads to chaos, crime, violence and unrest. Black single mothers to report declared, where at the center of, quote, a tangle of pathology in the Black community. Black leaders including the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is not taken to kindly to all this. They said that all this talk of Black pathology had unfortunate racist overtones and the issue dropped from the National Scene for years. then the Republicans pick it up. Ronald Reagan talked about welfare queens, Dan Quayles said the LA riots happened mainly because of a breakdown in traditional family structure. For two decades the entire national debate of a welfare reform has often seemed  it's really just a referendum on inner city single mothers. Which brings us to Barbara Clink's Gales. We gave Barbara Clink's Gales a cassette recorder, and for seven months she taped her family's life. And, story we bring you today. Her life in her own work. It isn't that it completely contradicts everything in the national debate over single mothers. Though sometimes it does contradict that way. It's more that when you hear her talk, the national policy discussion somehow seems irrelevant and off the point. It is if the policy makers have no real picture of what a life  hers is really . Today we devote our entire program to her story from the BBC Chicago, Public Radio International Smert Life. I'm Eric Glass. most African-American single mothers,  77% of them, Barbara Klink's scale's works for a living. She has a job in the new information economy, as a data entry operator. She's so committed to seeing that her kids graduate high school, that when her son Gerald cuts some classes, she started escorting him to class herself, telling his classmates, my name is Barbara. I think we'll be... single lot of each other from now on. Before we start our story, some quick statistics to put all this in perspective, Barbara's family is not unusual at all. There has been a radical shift in American family structure. The number of children born to black single mothers has risen from 17% in 1950 to 70% 70% in 1994. The number of white children born to single mothers has risen even faster from 1.7% in 1950 to 25% here then is the story of one single mother told her in her own words Hi, I know we laid on fire. She had my pop this time. Let me introduce myself. My name is Park. Hi baby, good morning. My single mom, I have three kids, Angie, Tess and Jura. Good morning. Angie's 25, Tess and Jura are 17, their twins. there in high school in the 11th grade. Hi, my name is Barbara Kleska. There's no need. I know I know that. You're somewhere, Kleska. Yeah, I always bring him to school. Oh, OK. And I stand here while he goes to his life and comes back. Every morning, I take your to school. If I don't take him to school, he'll get up, get dressed, and he'll just sit there. He won't go. In order to take him to school, I have to go a half hour out my way in the opposite direction of my workplace. Then after I leave his school, it takes me another. 50 minutes to an hour back past my house before I get to work all the gather takes me an hour and a half to two hours to get to work in the morning. But I'm sorry Mr. Mayba. Okay, I'm sorry. Last week almost every afternoon I'm going to go get my book. He did not come to my afternoon classes. I can't go get my book. Okay. Where were you? Where were you? Sorry for the keeping you quiet. You stayed in school, but you just didn't go to his class. That doesn't sound  it makes any sense. Does it, jerk? Where did you go with you stayed in school? The twins don't go to school in the neighborhood we live in. I had to borrow my coworkers at dress to get them into a Vulcan High School, because that's the Vulcan High School. It's a real good school. They really care about the kids and they work with you. Jero's teacher, Mr. Mayba, he care about Jero as if Jero was his own child. Grieve it on, come on, you musta tell us. No big dark secret is it? Where even gone? Where did you go last with? Sure, I don't think he's on your neck. No. Yes they are. What is it? No, man. See that Mr. Lego? That's what he probably doing. Those are the love hashy mark he keeps. If I hit you upset you, hey, do  what they are? Right now, all I can focus on is to try and end them through high school. Keep them through high school. Then we're walking down the other side of the school to the council office, Mr. Ware. We've got to read the state bureau because it was two cuts. When I talked to him about graduating, I also tell him when he walked across the stage. a car doorbell and my desk is open and she says she's not here to split and the clients look at us and lie and miss it  they're gone. They want to see that as well as our practice room. I know you guys want to have a class in the safe. Okay, what I was doing, the moment of silence, I was writing my name in a time sign-in on a sign-in sheet and I want one or two. I'm sitting here to measure the daily healing 來 I always dreamed about going on a farm, all the senior activities that the same is to when they graduate from high school. They get a chance to go on a farm because when I was graduating from high school I had a moral apartment and I've been out on my own since I was 16 years old. So I had to play growl up. I can live some of my dreams through the videos. That's why I feel the way that I feel. That nothing is going to get in my way. Nothing. You really think you're smart, you don't see. You really think you can't wait for something  that. Do you think I'm gonna give up? Huh? Do you think I'm gonna give up? Gerald, I'll talk to you. Hey. If you're in control, ask a cup of tea. If I actually be out there on the streets, no education or a dime, trying to deal drugs or have somebody, I will take your life and ask a cup of tea.

He didn't even go. She dropped out of school. He had babies in everything, but she's still a good person. She's  my first born. And, Gerald is my niece, me and his son, this, this, almost life. I never had a father. I never had a brother. And so, only time I ever loved a man was in a relationship. When my son was born, that's the man who lives in an unconditional life. and the heat, his love is just because of his mama. He's not because he wants something from me. It's not because he wants sad, so something. I may have found me, love me for me. . And test, she's a carp and copy of me. how to work, she's a young me.

At his, our group of ladies is named friends since high school. We do all kind of stuff together. We land here. We tall. We watch movies. We get in trouble with.

We lead the kids, the husbands, the job we leave everybody. We're in a role, man, eat, laugh and talk and just don't do nothing. And I make a picture of this to Jamaica. And we have been planning and paying for these trips as I told last year. And whenever the hands are sitting around talking about our trip to Jamaica, we end up talking about our fantasies. And what we're going to do when we get there. Every hen is... as a different fantasy about Jamaica and what they wanted to. My fantasy is on the beach, a big black piano with this man in a white jacket, and I named him Sam, playing the piano, playing  love song. I know this. And me leaning over with a exotic drink, and me constantly saying, play it again, and then간avia. When I go out with my girlfriend and let me in and go out, especially on one of those hoochy moments  hoochy moments, sometimes we're talking about something. I mean hoochy moments and I didn't even want to do a sex. We don't know what the truth is. It's so lovely, visually  something to split. And I go out and let me in and let me just love it. It is all over me. But they don't know that that's the... people to win. Everybody know that my people to win. My co-hark is fine about my people to win. I asked  if they know pop or the high work or the mom and friend. They're not any people to win a slip at their part. But when I go out to the man who needs to win. Me. The night we get to Jamaica, I'm gonna get out on the balcony. And then I'm gonna let all of them make me know that I'm fair. I'm gonna do the scene again. But you do the scene again. and they run them away. No baby, not that Zena Gel, Bobber's standing out on the balcony and they're counting my half-law and then the wind all day. When they get to know me, they see that evil twin was just that personality fuzz them all with that night, our party and dance and laugh. And then they get to know the series and eat them all. The high worker, breadmobber, they get counter-turned-off, and they constantly refer back to the night wind. that personality. What's your insight? Master's death. Get an appointment. It is for him. I don't know. When I talked to him on the phone, that's where we have met in the economy out. And I try to help in a decent conversation with him. And he wouldn't know how to make up. What's your favorite position? I hope that you  to make up in life. That's not a good point. I'm , do you have kids? , where you work at? Are you religious? , I'm going to talk about these things and then I get turned off. No. And I want to talk anymore. No. Let's go, Pat. When we go to Jamaica, I'll just make one passionate love. My girlfriend, Patia, she's going to do this thing and going through. And we said we have... PhDs on in hop-work. We can write a book on, no, that's not it. , and we just sit up and relax and we're talking. We always tell each other, well, , one day, put on the ADHD other's wedding, we're going to be standing up there and looking at each other, walk down an hour and love the happy. And so far, I read here, we sit up and talk about the ADHDs and we are a new chapter to our book. It just doesn't seem to fail. Oh no, man, it's too late. It's too late. It's too late.
