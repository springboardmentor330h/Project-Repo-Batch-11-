While waiting for the bus on a very strange hotel friend, but actually I can't tell you the friend said, he got first one in the year, that the content of the friends advice might not be suitable for young listeners. If I had the content of most of today's program, it's a American life by the way, my request, may not be suitable for young listeners. This program is stories. Three women and the sex industry So Seriously the street these job Calls friend from college my friends says come to phone sex with me and so I went to her house that night and we got drunk and took phone sex calls And I did it the first time and I was really good at it and we made  80 bucks and most of  the first net What instructions did she give you? See  gave me a list of dirty words. It wasn't even a list. It was  just this collage. Typed her handwritten. And just every single word that's associated with sex either, either profanity or just words  wet and hot and steamy. She said that if you got lost, you could really just string them together. And she was really, really, really funny. The guys in the phone seem  the normal range of guys you meet Sarah says. Someone  the bull, maybe 20% she felt  she could have been friends with. The other 10% she really liked. She would do cars where she was supposed to dominate the man and cars where she was supposed to be black or Asian. , you could just sort of do this accent. It was incredibly unpicated. You could just sort of do this accent which approximated  a guy in Nebraska's idea of what it is that an Asian woman talks and they would be. Okay, for example, so for example, if you would say something to me in this accent, for example, describe what you're sitting right now as this Asian woman , I really Your dignity will preclude you from doing that. Yes It will really well. I don't have that. I'm just dignity, but I can't do that. Why I respect that? I Also had a British accent. This is really really awful, which I which I modeled after I'm the The woman on LA law come on. Let's do that No not going to do it for you. How is that? That wasn't very good. I'm not going to control where Ms. Orchik is headed me. I want you to take a hands-up of your pants for me please don't I- Alright you can stop right there. It's public broadcasting. She did phone sex for a year. They got a job as a naked dancer. She did this for two years. She said that she heard her back dancing for hours and high heels, she ate her bosses. Every now and then a customer. I remember would say something mean to her. But she really, really liked when she worked with. And on the Saturday night, she would have a better time dancing naked at her job to loud music. Then say, don't you want to party with her friends? Because everyone comes trying to tell me, oh, you really hate this job, and you just don't know that you hate it. But I couldn't feel that I hated it. I called my sort of close friend. I said, do you think it's stupid that I'm doing this? , I don't feel  I don't  this job. I feel  I  it. I get up and... morning and I go to it and I don't mind. And he was , well, , if you don't, if you feel  you  it, then you probably do. That was sort of a ramble, but I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is there were really, really crappy things about it, but it was so far from the worst job that I've ever had. Really, what was the worst job in this? I'm just going to stop the tape right here. I'm just going to stop the tape and come in life. To give you a moment to consider what that worst job might be before she gives her answer. Okay, we all thinking now. I hear we go. Being a grant writer for the Central Park Conservancy. Being a grant writer. A job I myself have done. She said she didn't  working in an office. She didn't  taking orders. Being naked in front of strangers was preferable to taking orders. She says if you want to understand what this job is . She says it's really for her anyway. Not that different. Another service industry job she said. I think it was  day to day, just  any, just pretty much  any job that's not a great job. , that's  wait you say. I mean, , there's some days where you're waitressing and you're going, oh, this is pretty cool. I'm making pretty good money. , I'm working out in patio today. It's nice that in the same days. We're , if I have to ask one person what they want on their hamburger, , I'm just, I'm gonna shoot myself. What does Sarah's experience? Other women have a different experience. sex industry. Today on our program Act 1, someone whose life comes apart working in the Go Go clubs, Act 2, a diverse pornography to having sex with this girlfriend, changes. Stay with us. Act 1. Susan. Plus summer, reporter and radio producer Sandy Tallinn was new to a story about the sex industry workers respect. named Susan Walsh, was an aspiring writer who worked in Gogo bars in Jersey, Steve Sun. And then, a week of self-requid, we're going to start working with Dr. Susan Walsh disappeared. On July 16th, she left her home in the New Jersey to make a call at a pay-phone on the corner she didn't ever call on. She left her wallet, keys, and her beeper behind, she found a key would be right back and she knew from that. Everybody closed for her, since she's dead. So Sandy Fallen decided to set out on a different story. Try to understand what her life is  in the go-to-bar treasures. And to understand what might have led to her life from the heart. Again, the winning parents, this is another story about the sex industry, the large sexiest of her main at the suit of her feelings. My first stop is at Village 4, the Royal Friend James Richner, who says it wasn't on his arm. Jim and suggested Susan Walsh and I worked at him. She used the research and we spoke red lines. inside the sex industry which tells the story from the point of view of the work of the stripper, the street lockers, the hogers and horned happens. I first met Susan Walsh from the Office of Screw Magazine when I was working on a book about the sexiest you went to see about how gold's theater. And as I was talking to him I was complaining about how I couldn't get any worms and business. And I asked him to see if he could be some advice. He said, why are you having some women coming here? walking. She writes for us she'd be really good she'll notice that and at that point for some reason she writes woman's opinion appeared she had one block here and flying in the streets. Motorcycle Jack and she was just skiing off. She hardy looked  some people, stripped this, go get me into it. She looked kind of a college only as a little woman that looks as if it was in 30s. single mother trying to break in the dreams and hang the bills by dancing chosen comon. Susan started working with Jim to three days in the week. She was very smart, she's shooting in the sex business nobody ever met when I was doing this book, and I played with her people. She knew all aspects of it and what she didn't know she find out she was  her. I'm really good and quarter. And she was truthfully good mother. Big thing for , for us and David, who at that time you, , 10-11. , he comes my office and works on Peter, he works his homework, but he is a work on telephone and he taught. And she was just totally here to go to school. Susan along to be a full-time writer, Jim Gatton, to write a few pieces on Google from Voice, and he said, well, I'm going to go with film and radio books. But dancing in the books, she worked six days a week, and she was two shifts a day, just barely making. And she was always taught as a background. with her cheese and her inner heels. She didn't have the money to get on the past train to go home. She would just check into one of these clubs and dance set. See if she can imagine bucks. That's not exactly the highlight. The dust I had through the Lincoln tunnel to the Jersey Turn five passed the big light oil storage days in Rusty Pune's National Gas. I'm writing with Jill Moore, writer and actress, who worked in Jersey Go Go tell a couple of years, which got sick and relaxed. Jill was a friend of substance. It's terribly sad. I go in and out of emotional value, but sometimes it just seems too absurd to be true that it's happy. It's just just just such a loss.

She pimped its toward the men, pauses, presses her breasts, costume of lodges and folded up dollar bear in the beach. At the bar we ask her out, but nobody seems to remember much about Susan Walsh.

George came to our clinic in early autumn and was diagnosed by the intake worker with an anti-social. personality disorder, a sociopath, a deviant, whom I, a newcomer to the field of psychology, was now assigned to work with and therapy on undefined period of time. He looked almost ridiculously tough, sitting in a sleeveless letter vast in the clinic's lobby, hair scrunched back in ponytail, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, tattoos coiled over his arms, immediately I thought. awkward in his presence. The day I met George, I was wearing my working garb, a sun dress, and pair of falling apart flats, legs wily from hair I don't have shade, perhaps a swatch of slip showing beneath my hem. I felt stout and dumpy. As a therapist, I think I should be beyond these silly social embarrassments. I think I should at least be beyond my own bodily insecurities enough to throw my forward attention to quietview. laugh, but I'm not. Around George I'm not. In the sense of shame he evokes a new to be stay, is part of our treating story together. My office at the time was windowless, and so small we had to sit with our knees near brushing. I got ready to ask my usual orienting questions. Age, I ask. Instead of answering me, George gave a dramatic sigh. I have been waiting for this day, and said, I've seen six of you guys and so far no one's worked out. I needed a doc who can really push me, I need to be challenged. Challenge, I asked. how? I've got my problems, George said, and I can admit to them. The other six I went to just sat there and stared at me. I went somewhere, hoped it'd. me feedback, make me see things in a new way. So what are these problems? George sat back, ran one hand over a large tattoo on the bicep. Mastervation. You see, I can't stop. Okay. 7, 8, 9 times a day. I have strong advice. Now we've pulled a list out of his pocket and agreed. Mastervation, pornography, aggression. defensiveness, pride, control, these are my problems. Take porn. I love it, but the truth is I'd rather do it with a video tape than with my girlfriend, Joanne. You have huge beats, huge, Jordan said. My anger is just, you paused. I think I could kill her. I've killed a few people before, so I wouldn't put it past me. Jordan was staring straight out and said this. Testing for the reaction. So why do you think you prefer porn to people? I said keeping my voice even despite the fact that I suddenly felt that it's me. Don't get me wrong, George said. I  Joanne. She's a real smoker. But I'll be honest, the picture is just a lot easier. It's to completely quiet and beautiful God. She thought of my own bot and thought my breasts and his mind rest burned the shame. George is 35. years old and has lived seven of those years on the street, drugging, knife-fighting, stealing. He has been clean now for half a decade, a really remarkable achievement which he attributes to his spirituality, a weird blend of mysticism and having now. In his apartment where he lived with Joanne, he has two special cobbots side by side. In one of them he keeps his incense and tarot cards, and the other he stores his collection of fatal mysticistic videos magazine. At me the second cover design was floral contact paper left by the pierced meat. They bring him satisfaction in these videos. A lot goes on for a new trick. Joanne is, as he said, a beautiful woman but she is also unpredictable in the self-resour. A series of size and excitement seeking out control. He tells me he is from the old school, and expects his woman to cook and come to her fish on the table by six. That's the... halls, and sex where her bones are synchronized to kiss. When Joanne lets him down, he gets manned, really read-faced furious so he calls her up and stow all, while absurd across the face. He feels so much sheer and rational hate that he has to retreat to his room to watch his videos. They suit him, images, and their flash control. In our first several sessions I tried to find the origins of his hate. For instance, George's father beat him, but the beatings were not as bad as the humiliation that went along with him. He remembers the strap, the hands that were  hatches. But the intensity of his tail lies for me in this niche. The small boy, pressed against you for drape. White is an up-show bedsheet. The man pressing against him, shouting. George could feel his... Father's groan, hot and hard, right in the milk between the stats. He started to think of himself as a new, new girl, gross gaping place. He imagined his body was a girl's. George was discussed, horrified. Soon after where he learned to fight, started to lift weights, running from the softness that is the representative ball with us. I had at first a hard time dealing with George because he offended me. I understood his pornography obsession as a deflection of his own anxieties, so he would not have to feel his fear, his memories, helplessness, he tried to control me. Now understand, I am a woman who I spent much time in need to please me. I am a woman who, in her adolescent days, denied herself food or through it all up. so I could fit into the airless image this man in my office with all the struggling to possess and shit, seen time. I remember the smell of myself as an anorexic, a frail dry or  scorched grass, my limbs coated with hair. Because of these memories, it was impossible for me to to urge, but I did feel deeply for you. After all, I had not I want to strip him for the same goals to eradicate the weak part of the self in hurts. the streets and fields. During the first few weeks of our therapy together, I began to feel the old shame about my body returning more strongly than it had in the wild. Although George said he wanted help to overcome his pornography obsession, sometimes driven watch five, six-millimeter, and to learn to defuse his rages, he used his sessions to vent about Joanne's latest transgressions, and from there, would segue into dietrides about perfect Nelson6 their size and smell. After a day during which I'd seen George head ended, I would go home and feel my flesh more heavily than ever. I often felt  weeping. And it was during this time that I noticed small black hairs growing up around my nipples. In the one hand I want to pluck them out. On the other hand I want them to grow, lush  the marshwood springs up in slands. My prescription was for George to learn somehow that being soft is not me and molested and mooded messes up. You would have none, but of course. We had been going at it for about two months and told me a story that boldly no one. The woods of his childhood home divided his family's house and take the suites, classmate lived through several stains of pints. George was nine years old and that day Teddy promised him to use his own. and Tom and Troy truck, only George would come over and play. But when he got there, Teddy went back and was part of bargain. The truck, no, it's not a share. George had walked all this way. He had stumbled over trees and opened himself. Hope he would find his pool. So we home took his father's knife, some rope from the cell, and made a gallows and blue and Susan branches and survived. Boy, have I got a cool thing to show you? George said to it, you got a cop. Then when they were there, George said, look up. He was floating against the sky, the news, very bright in the sun. Clung, George said, using the knife to persuade. He used the blade on the kid's soft skin and had a sudden jarring image of his mother in kitchen morning wearing apron and slicing for a warm bar butter. Teddy was up there. George usedドchtford work.

Serious political parties. People appearing in the war edited by the ヨプasteressoer, beans andrated and his head and place, kicked away the stairs, so all of a sudden he takes swung, neck, punched the news. I was leaning forward in my seat. The rope broke, he said, I knew it would. I just wanted to scare him because I wouldn't be half. I can't be half, you see what I mean? I'm saying anything. Otherwise I feel  I'm just a dormitory. He took an aim redrag on the sacred. But do you think everyone in the whole world wants to treat you as a dormant? Use you in some way? Absolutely, Georgetown. I know it. It must be tiring or anything that you can never really let down your guard. Have you ever cried in front of someone to show that you're scared, set? George didn't say anything. Long silence settled in this. You are cut court. one step. What's going on George? Why is it unsafe to feel anything but defensiveness or violence in the office? Do you think I'm going to take advantage of you? Immediately I realized I've made wonder by allowing him the opportunity to sexualize a interaction. You take advantage to be that's going to be other way around. You lean back and you share living up. I saw the smoke slide on his mouth, felt it wrapped around the blue and gauze of cloud, getting me in moving material with a super dress. George believed that the body's outside him on missile's poise and poises. His aggressive slid-eyed stance is a typical nail-fnumb none. My eating disorder, the obsessive desire to be thin, thin, and perfectly poisonous the poised is typically female, numbness. Georgian I were both victims of our culture's fear of the feminine, unable to lay down our system of weapons and spread our legs open to life, because we learned that in this posture we would be ashamed, not in vigory. We did not know how to trust what we could not dominate. And recovering anorexic is not only in a particular, good position. in her articulating his truths. She was also ironically in a particularly good position these have the therapy to treat insogenous male. She understands perhaps better than anyone the urge to whip and dominate discipline and delete the female form. For years I was hungry but could not risk the softness of surrender. I dreamt of letting down my guard sitting at a table on which silver dishes seem ingesting colors orange. carrots, soft wounds, tomatoes, tangy dirt, chocolate cake. But I couldn't dare. Couldn't trust enough to let myself go. These are the memories that came to mind when I looked at George, rigid in his tube, his face set against the seatage of any motion that was in cool or mood. He told me about forcing himself to rise before dawn each morning, working out two hours and then, there were 40 sale adjustment methods, including $44 and $371 worth personal intervention. Now, I nodded yes, I didn't done the same for myself. The more deeply I went into it, the more difficult to became. Our therapy started to evolve so that I played a mostly silent role while he went on and on and on. I was seeing about Joanne's anatomy, the six-hour cloud. her type of sex. What about me? I wanted to say to me. Does it occur to you that I'm a woman here? That you just might be offending me? Let me that another smaller voice was burning. About me. We're not also attractive. Do I not measure up to your standards? Why not? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The antirulize are sessions were a lot  porn, in which I, the silent subject, absorbed his fantasies, and in my featurelessness reflected them back to you. George let me know clearly what my role in a relationship was, by shifting impatiently in a rice spoke, by the quick brushing motions in the avidous hands as though to sweep away my words. By interrupting me and then exploding into a radical temper, if I asserted my right to finish my own sentence. Quiet, he wants Lord, me. Now I,  a little girl, sank back down my seat. He felt dark and sprawled around me. I wonder if you ever think I finally burst out of you one day, that I might be uncomfortable with your sexual talk, with the kinds of expression to use. Let's hear it. shrink George said. That's what you're here for, and it's your whole job. I wanted to reach out and slacken. Not even in my office and I just shrink. I am also a woman and the way you talk about my gender disgusts me. I would never talk to a woman I was trying to make it with  that. Sure, that's positive. It's supposed to what George will come from. Alice, the real I thought. Supposed to mine, he said. Surprise, I said, I'm mine. George looked up at me, his expression confused. My face felt all red. But one moment then, our mask struck away. I could tell by the way George was looking at me. He was, for maybe the first time considering me not as a function. But it's even me. This smile, man. You not it. Hello. Shortly after this encounter, George left the state for six weeks to do a series of Carpentry jobs in Arizona. He returned to therapy in late May. He slumped down in his seat, looked at his lap. I was going to call you, he said in low voice. I had never heard him use that voice before. What happened in my hands? She left me, George Cine. She shook his head. Just  that. I called her at her parents and she says it's completely finished. Gonson. But I'm chasing you. I'm running after her  a goddamn desperate dog. Foning her 10, 20 times a day, falling in her ear. It doesn't matter what I do. It doesn't matter what you do, I see. We don't have to allow the story. about that. I've been trying every play with this bitch for the past week and earn what you want. Help us. This mouth was a bitter line of tension because I knew what. I think that's what upset you the most about Joanne's leading that you have no control that you feel helped the stouter band. George to my surprise not ... His own pain had made him flexible, open to vision and suggestion. For the first time in six months of treatment, I think we really talked. The next few weeks lots and changes in George. He found himself facing in motion and could not defend himself at ease. No amount of swearing or swaggering could express him more. the pain of Joanne's leaving so suddenly broke his shield with the intensity neither of us in anticipated. I withdrawn into George now and I told him to see. In some moments I think I saw his real face, the flow of motion crossed and when working in the city. I grew loving and loved the strength of the slow surrender. In the 80s August, I am 23 years old, I never met much, and I'm just out of college. I weigh 88 pounds. When I look out my bedroom window, I can see two lips. They are the most trusting beings, they are the first always open, they are long gold tongues in the count. Nothing bad happens to me. The sun doesn't break, we don't gag on women. This day, really many marks. I watched the world. I watched the neck cycle of this. Pusha as maybe this is what he was in. There comes a moment when recovery is religious. When a person says, all right, I will have faith and will lay down my sword and shield and see that the world works in the world. I look away from my bedroom in the and go downstairs out and porch. Someone has said a table for me. Slice to strawberry is lie  the tongues of babies and plants, wedges of cheese and bread. I'll put food in my mouth. For the first time years, I swallowed the softness, ice cream. I want to see if my body would blow up and disgusting fatness with the slow animals to give it a swelling and stomach. It doesn't. Letting down my guard, opening my many mouths does not bring about the room, the rate on the teeth. On the contrary, food brings vitality back to me. I feel my hair take on it, she, the long, is the new stock, stock, spring and bring. My brain now nourishes things in colors instead of calories. I can run harder, my eyes are moist enough to cry. George started to taste. Stiles voices times. He reported allowing himself to sleep late one more. He started going out some nights without his letter vest, black boots, tried kissing the woman I'm neck and going no farther. He brought wood home within the end of the work and days, stayed up late, making small objects without any obvious functions. A box mobile. She's okay. One day, he came to session and told me he had met a woman. Bucky. He thought he could fall in love with, but only he could get over Joanne. The other problem is, George said. She's the greatest person, but she's heavy, maybe 30 pounds over weight. I've never made it with a fat woman before. , me, I'm used to perfect curves. Thys, I can grab the hold of someone I flip  a doll. Give me one of his lead George Slimes. I was enchanted by the idea of George with a fat one. I had seen enough of George changed, make to imagine how his body would be with his fat ones arms. I imagined her rocking room and kissing her face and mouth. You could not help but see her spread lights on dead. And he, a little coward by the sight, so much trying to touch him, allowing himself entering to many layers of my mind. He brushes her, goes up past. and until he touches the curved rib bone, the hard male bone, taking a long time to go from the very and found only the full one of his thoughts.
