  "text": "When we were a week, we thought ourselves a new strong. And sometimes, if we were very weak, we thought ourselves a new, we were very, very strong. I mean, the question to play out was, I thought, I was, I thought, I was, I love, I remember my class, I think. Being able to, , taste the un Athletic kid who is very lucky. Probably seemed overly eager, so. And I had friends that would come over on the weekends. the school they would make our man reflected in the name. And so, when he was little, Chris Ware spent a lot of time thinking about superpowers. He drew superheroes over and over, trying to get them right. He always wondered, where somebody could find a radioactive animal,  one bit Peter Parker, turned him to be an amazing spider-man. He thought he might be developing his own real superpowers. There was one morning right, standing under the shower, of course in EG. and immediately, you're so cold the water is extremely hot by contrast. So you have the cold water turned up and you just animate it, you just do it, you just turn the cold water down. And I was in it for a very long time, I remember turning the cold and we didn't go any farther. That's where it was, it was stuck, you're dead on, going farther, but I am, to realize, you're standing under completely hot water, but I was, it felt fine to me. actually felt warm almost cool. The long-griseded there, it felt cooler and cooler than I. The only explanation I could come up with is that I developed the ability to withstand extraordinary heat. Of course we do. It's not a hot water, but that time I did not expect that happened at some hot waters. And let's come out of it. His first crush was Batgirl. Even now he says, if he just sees the colors of Batgirl's costume, just the colors, no image at all, just the colors. His heart still skips the. He invented his own superhero called the Hurricane, who could shoot blasts of wind from his hands and was drawn with huge manly muscles, made a hurricane costume to wear. Red tissue, black circle, each on it. A mask that is mom made for him. Yoke. There were a few times where I actually came to school with bits of a superhero costume, secreted under my school uniform. I guess I don't exactly know why I guess I thought I was , it's going to give me some sense of powers, but of course then I have gym class, , some, to change your clothes. I don't know what I was thinking. There was one time. Actually, this is sort of proof really super hero, but I'd actually drawn circuit boards on pieces of paper  by anic man 6th week done in the night actually I'd actually taped them on my legs to look  real circuitry exposed as if I had Mechanical legs or something that's I guess I vaguely thought that somebody would catch a glimpse of it think Wow, lucky's byonic Some of us spend a long, long time helping that we more than what the world thinks of us. And so, of course, we're drawing these stories of these mild mannered guys who under the clothes, wear a costume, and secret, but ours nobody suspects. And when we get older, it all seems ridiculous. It all seems really, really dumb. Chris Wear went on to draw cartoons for his living, but these cartoons that he draws now are  novels without real people and when a Superman type shows up in one of these cartoons it's always somebody trying to con kids with a costume and hate. He is always at this point. It's just more interesting that way. I think he's more  real dad that way. He's more  a drama in the fattery gets to a lot of all he gets  it. I had a few words Superman too. You're , , what do you care what you look ? You'd be all. And so you just, , you'd eat whatever you thought  you'd take whatever you wanted and eat anything. Really. terrible after a while. I think so. But I was super hero. I think I was probably, I mean, who's going to criticize you? Well, today on our radio program, super powers for real life stories about how easy it is to be caught up in the dream of them. At one, the invisible man versus Hawkman, the story of one man, two super powers and one big question . Question my friend that we all can face secretly. Question. The story of a kid who decided to take steps to become a superhero, systematic thorough steps that took her years well into adulthood. That three, the green team of superhero boy millionaires, Peppo, the amazing super monkey from Planet Krypton and the man from Shram, in this act, and inquiry into superheroes, and there are many each year that just never caught on at four, the Wonder Twins. The story of two, 12-year-old boys. in Burma, the real fighters who had entire armies believing that they could stop bullets and summon the dead and why so many people believe them. WB EZHCHAKAGO, a public radio international, a American life, a Maric glass, as a supervillain and say silence in the screen. Our program has begun. at one invisible man versus Hawkman. What we now present a kind of super contest for you, beloved super listener, between two ancient superpowers, two of the superpowers which have fascinated humans to sense antiquity, and actually this is kind of a super-worshacht test. John Hodgman has been conducting an unscientific survey, positive for people, a very simple choice. Flight versus Indisibil. This question is only for you. whichever you pick, you'll be the only person in the world have that particular super-power. You can't have love, which do you choose? I started wondering about this a few years ago. I'd bring it up at parties, dinners, flooding receptions. It was more interesting to ask them where people worked or where they went to school and clearly more fun to answer. a magic word, shazam, flight versus invisibility would instantly change in evening's character, opening passionate conversation and debate. What's up? Christy Moore was how quickly everyone would choose. That's so they had been thinking about it for a long time. Everyone knew exactly which super power they wanted and what they would do with it. Their plans weren't always flashier, irrelevant. In fact, they almost never... If I could fly the first thing I would do was fly into the bar, check out what's going on there, fly back home. It was to attach my baby to me and fly to a doctor's appointment at 11.30. Fly right. back. I think I would slide with Lennoxie. I would imagine if we got around that I had the power of light and it was a rare type of thing. I mean they would definitely be  groupies. I would imagine. So there's going to be just , oh yeah, I just slept the flying dude. , people are just , help. Score. I go into Barney's. I pick out the cashmere sweaters that I . I go into the dressing room that women says how many items I say five. I go into the dressing room, I put those five sweaters on. And I summon mine, powers of the disability, in the dressing room. I turn invisible. I walk out, leaving her to wonder why there's a tag hanging from the door that says five. I'm alive. person. So you would become a thief pretty quickly. Immediately until I had all the sweaters that I wanted and then I would have to think about it and fix to do. Typically this is how it goes. People who turn invisible sneak into the movies are on to airplanes. People who fly, stop taking the bus. There's one thing that pretty much no one ever says. I would use my car and just  creams. No one seems to care about crime. Then I think I would want to spend a little time using my pair of good. I mean, if I don't have super strength and I'm not, , invulnerable, then I mean, would be very dangerous. You'd have to rescue somebody from a burning building or something  that. You might, , catch on fire. Just having flight. I don't think it's necessarily flight enough. I'm going to be on the super strength. I'd still be weak. I got there I guess. I don't fight crime now and people without superpowers do so. Sure and theory yes but  I'm not a what can I do with this I mean either one of those you see you need a whole package there's not much you can do with any one thing I'd go to Paris suppose. It's not being super well they may  I could be going to Paris man sort of a superhero mm Going to Paris, man is not superior. And I have to say this drove me crazy a little bit. We are after all talking about the superpowers. Why not take down organized crime, bring hope to the hopeless, swear vengeance on the underworld. It's only a little bit. I propose to variety of sample scenarios along these lines, such as, how would you handle a mad genius taking over the Empire State Building, or a group of terrorists hijacking to CRA Go D stands announcements and why I learned is some people should simply not fight in crime. The first thing that occurs to me is because sneak up behind them very low and the knife that they didn't see and slice their achilles tendon. Oh no, I somehow show a sock in their mouth or something  that so they can't and rub some tape around their mouth so they can't be allowed. And might not be a sock, might just be some knackin'. or something. I can't keep all this in the end. I have to keep a bag full of stuff with me. knives, socks, tape, tape, do you think you would be tempted to enlist a teenage helper? , yeah, I think I'll help her would be good to help her with the complimentary tower. There's no other anybody else. Oh, it would just be at. Teenator hang around? No. People who consider invisibility always want to know, do I have to be naked? People who choose flight want to know how fast. Almost all ask, who would win an affight? It's during visible or flying. And so I had to lay down. some rules. In visibility means the power to become transparent will, including your clothing, but anything you may pick up is visible. Flight means the power to fly at any altitude within the Earth's atmosphere, at speeds up to 1,000 miles per hour. But even then they start looking for loopholes, hidden catches, super power fine print. They start negotiating their dreams with me. Now, when you're flying, if you're flying in a thousand miles an hour, at disk, I'm... 100.0F feet. Are you comfortable? Do you get very cold? Let's say I'm in this room and I'm invisible and I'm walking around this apartment and I'm invisible. And yes do I have to be completely quiet for you guys? Well  you're my footsteps. Because that's a pain in the house and also somebody's to let you in. Can I carry someone can somebody go on my on my back? Can you carry someone on your back now? Little people, little people yeah. Then you can carry little people on your back. Done. Flight it is. This is all part of what I call five stages of choosing your superpower. Sometimes this process occurs in just moments. For example, subject day, polished man. classes pledged into a cramped bar room corner, begins as they all do with stage one, got reaction. Initially I would think perhaps in visibility, the next come stage to practical consideration. Because you have the ability to walk around work, crafts, show up at one point, and perhaps go away for a little while and turn invisible and then come back and listen to what they say and give the power to spy on your axis. And that would all be enlightening and fun and in fact a little bit perverted. And you hear that deafness voice? That's beginning stage three. Philosophical reconsideration. That would, I believe it would immediately turn into a life of complete depression. You wouldn't get to really share with anyone. And I know there'd be some problems. with the perversion thing. Stage 4, self-remination. Invisibility, lead to these things, as an invisible person, down in our cat, because you're not going to miss out when you're invisible on, , no matter how many times you're seen a woman naked in a shower, you're going to want to see it again because there's always a different woman, right? And there's just  a lifetime of that. And that... That's not acceptable behavior. No matter whether you're invisible or not. And finally, stage five. Acceptance. Yeah, that's a good flight. So who chooses invisibility and who chooses flight? In my experience, though there are lots of exceptions, men lean toward flying, women to invisibility. And many good angst. just lay over their choice, switching from one to the other and back again. And that's because more than the ability say to burst into flame, shoot arrows with uncanny accuracy, flight and invisibility touch a nerve. Actually, they touch two different nerves, speak to very different primal desires and unconscious fears. My friend Christine shows invisibility. What's a good power is about something that's obvious in the other is about something that is hidden. I think it indicates your level of shame. How do you mean? Persono chooses to fly has something to hide. A person who is being visible wants clearly to hide themselves. Do you feel that you want to hide yourself? I want to... I'd  to not... I'm not gonna answer that question. You get all this to do with the guyel, wanting to be invisible means that you're a more guyel full person if you want to fly means you're a guyelist. I think the reason that I'm so conflicted about flying versus invisibility is that I have guyel but I really wish that they didn't. It is the hero, selfless and competent and unashamed. And invisibility, the villain. Almost everyone I talked to called invisibility, the sneakier power. Flying as people who want to let it all hang out. Invisibility is for fearful, crouching masturbators. First of all, I think that a lot of people are going to tell you that they would choose flight, and I think they're lying to you. I think they're saying that because they're trying to sound all mythic and heroic because is the better angels of our nature were tell us that the real thing that we should strive for is flight and that that's no more than all that can solve. But I think actually if everybody were being perfectly honest with you they would tell you the truth which is that they all want to be invisible so that they can shop-lift, get into movies for free, go to excited places on airplanes without paying for airline tickets, and watch celebrities have sex. Add anyone face with this choice and their heart of hearts will choose and disability. Yes, or they have this sort of insulated, heroic, mythical concept of themselves and the infects do not really give an extra respect to thought. In the end it's not a question of what kind of person flies and what kind of person fades. We all do love. Perhaps that's why when I put the choice to myself. I'm hopelessly completely stuck. Have the heart of this decision? Question I really don't want to face is this. Who do you want to be? Person you hope to be? Or the person you fear you actually are? Don't rush into it. Think it over. Which would you choose? Sanagement I can't do more than any my kids. I gotta get that man for me. I can't do anything. Exactly. Wonder Woman. Okay. What are the ways to create a superhero? Gamma rays, space alien abduction, prison experiment, or NASA flight phone arrive? And then the idea of a list is impossible that it to do list is powerful enough to achieve this incredible result. to let me get her smits up in the trunk. We met in the bar in Flagstaff, Arizona. I'd just moved back from Cambodia, and I was going out for one of my first beers back in the States. Not long into the first one, I noticed this Amazon of a woman with huge blonde and red street hair and frosty lips, wearing a short red tank dress, and at least 50 bracelets. She's six feet tall and showing a lot of leg. People at the bar swivel their heads to watch her every move. She stands next to me to order a drink, and in this throaty voice says, what are those pointing to my cigarettes? I tell her they're Cambodian. Her eyes light up, she shoots out a long, tan arm, and points it at table in the corner. She orders me there. Before I can say no, I'm following her to my seat. She tells me she's an international private investigator, a bounty hunter, and a bail bonds and forcer, and that her name is... Zora. I sit there for hours listening to her. Within a week she takes me to Las Vegas. We drive there in her red Mustang. As always, there's a cult 380 under the driver's seat and a 45 megastar in the trunk. In Vegas, we skipped the casinos and had straight for the mail strip clubs. Where Zora drops at least $200 on lap dances from buff guys with names her get up is the same as before. hair, jewelry, and ubiquitous tank dress, which I realized is the best way to show off her tattoos. One is this big circle with blue and white swirls in it, kind of  a bowling ball on her left shoulder. Every guy she meets asks her about it, and when they hear her answer, they sometimes propose marriage. Turns out the tattoo is a magic globe, she holds in her dreams. And in these dreams, it gives her superpowers, ever sick. I remember how the dreams. And they're very vivid, but it varies. It usually involves fighting. Sometimes with guns, sometimes with superhero powers  me. It's my fist, all that. And I usually have super strength and I can fly and I have all those things. And it's my most common set of dreams. And it varies. Sometimes it's medieval. Sometimes it's futuristic. Sometimes it's  a guerrilla war in Latin America. But it's  a guerrilla war in Latin America. Can you describe that Zora to me the Zora and dreams? Very powerful, athletically, but beyond the rules of nature that this world allows. So 6-foot 5 and long,  almost impossible long, silver hair. This sort of otherworldly quality too, where her voice sounds. did not sound normal, it sounded  almost music. It became something that I aspire to be. A aspire to be a sort of superhero, this sort of person who would spike for a cause. That was my motivation in life. Ever since I was 10 or 11, I decided. that that was my call. Zora took the dream seriously. So seriously that at the age of 12, she sat down and composed a list of some 30 skills she needed to learn if she wanted to become as close to a superhero as any mortal could be. She even gave herself a deadline. To master these skills by the time she was 23. It's news. Zora pulls out the old spiral notebook that was her diary at the age of 13 and turns to the inside back cover. There's a list. The list included martial arts, electronics, chemistry, metaphysics, and gliding, helicopter and airplane flying parachuting mountain climbing, survival. Throughout her tunes and funny, each time she's... started in a diary, she would update the list and write it in the back of the book. Each one with the same format, each one titled the list. Webinary ERAPTING. Scuba diving? Her biology, yes, I studied that. CPR, proceeded in mountain emergency kind of medicine. The list also includes bodybuilding, archery, demolitions and explosives. She wanted to learn how to hunt animals and death. a crack mat. Major physical condition. And the most incredible thing about all of this is that Zora accomplished nearly every item on the list. Rolling stars and compound bows and throwing knives and yes, it was very interesting. Last time, to keep up with the goals set by the list, she sped through school, starting in the seventh grade, she began completing entire school years during the summer term. She finished high school by the time she was 15. She got her BA at 18, a Master's at 20, and completed the coursework for a PhD in geopolitics by the time she was 21. She wanted to live  Indiana Jones, spending half her time in the classroom, and half her time saving the world in the jungles of Peru. Item number four, camel, elephant riding, invasive driving, stunts. When you're a kid, you have these romantic visions of what you'll be when you grow up. But how many people are so diligent they commit their dreams to paper and make it their life's work to achieve them. How many keep a list, amending, adding to it, ticking things off as they go along, well into their adult lives. So we're finishing the coursework for HPHD. So we're... decided to quit school, disappointed at the lack of cliffhanging adventure in her doctoral program, and since superheroes who live in the real world need jobs, she decided to seek employment, the only place that would allow her to put all the skills from the list to use. Zora wanted to become an agent in the CIA, and so began a rigorous application process, interviews, psych exams, a three-day lie detector test. Investigators out to interview me, interview my neighbors, interview ex-boyfriends, , you friends, ex-friends, former colleagues, people I work with, people I use to work with. They threw a question out in the living interview. So what would you do in this situation? If you were driving down the road and you had... I'm going to be your native agents with you. Someone who's going to give you some information. And you were in a third world country somewhere, and you were driving a car, and you accidentally ran into a dog. And people have been out playing the street children in the street. They see their dog, they kill them. And they get upset and they rush towards the car. What are you doing in that situation? You don't want to draw attention to the person who's with you. So what I said was that. I was a child major to get down lower in the car and I would get out of the car and draw the attention myself and try to appease them in certain ways either by giving them money more likely but and that was an acceptable answer. At the time when I was going through the process it felt  everything was coming together and I had not felt so much joy. I was actually told that I had to perfect personality for it and that I would do really well. It was  the fruition of my life that it was going to be the... step into the next, , where I would be using all that list and preparation for the next phase, which would be to actually put it in the practice. About eight months into the interview, Zora got a letter saying she'd been rejected. She appealed over the next year and a half, partly to find out why they turned her down. But the best they could do was to tell her to try again in a few more years. In the end, the CIA wouldn't take her and they wouldn't even tell her what. I probably took me one  two years or come. I was a basket case. I wasn't. I wasn't. I was just down. , I would have to work. I couldn't concentrate. I could slump down, staring at the wall. I put my whole life into examination. All the years of preparation. Most of us give up our dreams of superhero adventure when we're at a lesson. Sora was only getting to it at the age of 27. Here she knew how to fly helicopter and survive into wilderness. But for what? She devoted a lot of time thinking about why she might have been rejected by the CIA. Maybe it was all those months she spent right when the mission groups, doing her doctoral research. Maybe she shouldn't have told the CIA how she ended up in a clinic. in the East and IRA club one night while on vacation, Iroan. Maybe the CIA didn't  the fact that her father, a professor at the University of Minnesota, is an outspoken, Serbian nationalist, or maybe it was simply her own fault that she couldn't turn herself into a superhero. I had violated the agreement of the list, violated the agreement that I made with myself, and that had not been. come with what that the archetype was that I had become something . The point being that my mythology should have guided me better and it felt  such a final for you. So Zora remained herself. She had been virtually isolated from other people since she was 15. She started actively pursuing. that goals on the list. Her parents were happy she was so busy because she had no time for the way. But now she started working for a woman private investigator. One day when she went to court she wore her first pair of panting hers because she was told it would help her look more feminine. Soon after she was schooled in the sheer power of lipstick, short skirt, and a super model runway walk to control the minds of others. These days she works for an international. private investigation agency handles these categories. Child abduction retrieval custody, reverse things, a cult and ritualistic crimes, those tend to be really interesting, unlike one in those anti-terrorism, kidney-appertectionary return, counterintelligence. These happy doing this for a typical case, so we're with agencies. center on a mission to Mexico to do what's known as a reverse scam. The agency was hired by the family of a young woman who'd recently traveled there and fallen in love with a man she planned to marry after knowing it for only ten days. The family suspected some sort of con. Zura contacted him, pretending she was looking for a girlfriend who used to work with him in a travel industry. She took a photo of a classmates her to begin the scam. I sort of played the distressed American... student going to the Spanish school and he invited me on a couple of dates and asked me to come back for the bullfight. Where? Now I work  a little in British skirt and as a little tank top. I made it seem  I had plenty of money and that interested him that  he kind of perked up at that. He never mentioned the the whole time that I ever spent any time with him, he never mentioned that there was ever a woman. And he, I found him to be pretty emotionally open and very romantic guy, but I honestly felt that he probably was not in love with her, that he was taking this as an opportunity to live in the United States, and that was the report I gave. Before Zora set out for Mexico, I rode with her to the airport. We were late in hurrying through the terminal just ten minutes to spare. When she did the strange thing, she sat down in a chair far from the gate and wouldn't move. I told her she was going to miss her flight, but she didn't budge. I sat down next to her. She said she was scared about the case, about which disguise she might wear, about being found out. No, she said. She said she was afraid that when she got to Mexico, people wouldn't  her. The next time I was at her house, I hadn't noticed before, but I realized her bookshelf was packed with advice on how to build confidence. Titles  Francesca, Machiavelli for women. Books  that aren't really so far from the idea of keeping a list, having an ongoing plan for self-enprovement. Believe it or not. that if you just put something on paper and stick to it, you can change. Zora still has her list, but while the old list was all about being perfect and saving the world, the new list is very different. I need to learn how to play tennis golf and my new list is when surfing tennis golf, I need to develop some kind of talent,  I need to learn how to sing properly, but do some kind of comedy or sketch. who's acting, acting in either one, how to act. Oh, I need to learn how to sing  Billy Hawkey. She doesn't take the list so seriously these days. There are no deadlines. She puts things on the list and later decides not to do them. It's not a grand mission anymore. Now, it's just a list. Not a grand. C-C hybrid. How long is that different? GoallCSing! He's a man, a man with the mighty touch. A spider's touch, such a cool finger back in you, to enter his web of sin. But don't go in. Golden word, he will pour in your ears. But he lies, can't disguise what you feel. Billy Holiday, a Matator David Cideras, coming up exactly what Superman knows that Jigsaw Man doesn't. In a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program is. To American Life, from our class, each week on our program of course we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories. on it today's program, superpowers, and how easy it is to get caught up in the dream of superpowers. We've arrived at X3, at 3, the green team of superhero boy millionaires, the amazing supermookie from Plynick, Krypton, and the man from Shram, my friends, and the waves, 100-year- or more, whole armies of them, talking about new superiors, created by the comic book companies. It is rare for any of them to ask more than two years. The website gone and forgotten is... As far as we can tell, the authoritative archive of these failed super souls, the guy who runs the site and the title, your humble editor, Jonathan Morris, he says that the few great superheroes has common sense things by one, they've powers in making two of the sense to they have a reason for fighting crime. Three, the stories have a human patch to them. You can relate. You agree to come into the studio with a stack of some of the comics that do not quite Mash. We're seeing it. Try to find a very good, a ton of art. Let's see. We've got Captain Marvel, who's one of the characters featured on the website, is amazing powers that he can split by which we meet his limbs fall off and then flail around. Hopefully, I imagine, lighting up the criminal. I'm not kidding. He says split, his arms legs and head fall off and he screams, yeah, why popped apart. With a word, Sam, he returns to it. returns it to normal. That's why I'm in action. I don't even know why that is one of the most disturbing things I've ever heard. This company has a number of characters who shared their names with pre-existing characters. They had a plastic man who appeared in this very issue in fact, but it was nothing  the famous plastic man. Which was always an embarrassment to him. He'd be ordering, , he'd be ordering online, he'd get his mail all the time. That's ... He made a reservation at a restaurant and he showed up and he thought you would the other place the man. And there's even a point where he hears people yell plastic man on the street and he's not he's long past the point where he's thinking maybe they mean me. He knows the name of the guy. I did bring all the presses with me. Cres. Cres. The first team president in the States. A rather earnest young man he Cres record. becomes with a name  that, or it cannot. He becomes the first teenage president in the United States. This is the issue right before he has to fight vampires, too, which I was not responding to. I was aware the president had, but apparently it's right. Now, what is his superpower? , what kind of president does he make? Well, he kind of fits in that doc savage Batman mode. He's mostly a very well-trained human. He's taught by his. I hate to say this. His stalwart Indian companion, how to develop the all-important Indian tracking skills. And thanks to his Indian companion, Eagle Freeze, Manajari of animals, he learns several animal skills, helping teach Pres record how to be fast as an antelope, swing  a monkey, fight  a bear. , I've always thought that the United States Presidency would be so much more effective. Hasn't had the power to communicate. and troll the animals. Well, this one thing that pres proves, it's that there's nothing that the President can solve with two-fist and anine companion and a small army of birds and I want to say. If you would have explained to people the characteristics of a bad comic book superhero, there are obviously a lot of ways you can screw up. One of the ways is... to just overdue it, and cram the alms of character telling her his throat. One of the characters was a B-man, and everything about him was B's. His full name was Barry E. E. E. E. E. E. E. E. Is attacked by mutant B's, which were sent to Earth by Space Alien B People. He himself became a mutant B person who had B powers, and moved in a hive in econy and stole gold because gold looked  honey. and he could sting. There is nothing be related to this man refused to do. It says, you need somebody at a bar. You start talking to him in your realize he only has one interest in life. That's exactly what he wants to do. Everything would have gotten back to bees. You start talking about what you watch on television last night. So  I saw an interest in showing bees. there are certain stores  in a neighborhood and a matter of... business moves in, they always fail. But it's just one after another, if you're not there, are there certain powers that when people try to give them to people, it's just inevitably a formula for failure. There's one power that never survives on its own, and it always ends up enhancing it, and that would be shrinking. Now, why would that be because, because it, , that conforms to the rule of, if there's something intuitive about that, that anybody can understand, you get small. There's something intuitive about that, but then you also real. that you're small, now I can take it. And usually the power that the lad is, is what kind of thing, what kind of things would they add to the little guys? Well usually the one they get is you get to keep your full human strength. They  to give them something relating to being small. Antman has the ability to control ants. And again, as I say, I realize that's probably not much better. Well, that was going to say, , yeah, look, he's a strong as a guy and here some ants. He was just invaded the picnics of superpowers. Do you certain comic superheroes come out of particular moments in the nation's history? Positively, that's no other thing that really works against characters when they're tied and too tightly to a fan or a tied in two dilators. Something that is identifying an error. There's a character created in the 70s but who's supposed to be a retro character from the 50s named 3D Man. To help him hook up on the 3D movies that were a crazy 50s. Terrible, flat character. Nothing going on. And when you say 3D Man, what was his power? He, the hem of a magical pair of glasses. And had the strength of 3 men. And that's it. He was the strongest 3P. Fastest 3 people, whatever that means. Probably 3 times faster than human being. They always describe it as something as so much as 3 men, but I don't see it in 3 times. The agility of 3 men. There's 3 guys who are agile, but I have a little trouble with 3 men. Part of the problem with just naming off the superheroes are of power is that on the face value there's not a superhero who doesn't seem silly. Because you have to take to a point where the man is wearing a costume and he's driving around fighting crime. Then where does the line come where they rise above that? Do you have a theory on this about what makes it good when and about? I have sort of a half-form theory. I know that one of the things that really helps to super-park it over with the audience, get over three-eders is if it's something they can apply to the normal lives, grasp by way of fancy. And that's, I think, why super-strength, super speed, invulnerability or just general toughness or often so common, you can get on the court with it, get that super accuracy and it's slammed on from mid-court and really just school over somebody. Then that's probably a super-parry you want. But when you start getting into powers one character who had magnetic eyes of super-power, which is a little too esoteric to evalorce. Yeah, I don't even understand anything. Yeah, what does it mean? Magnetic eyes of super power. But yeah, in this first appearance, the announce that he had magnetic eyes of super power. They would illustrate little beams coming out of his eyes, making metal things shoot right at them, which would be terrible. This works. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Draked a high-end seedling If you have x-ray ice, please promise not to be alive Well first we count to 10, and then we'll have some fun Before we fly away, before we count to one day At four, the one to two He may have read or heard something of this story. How in a civil war in Burma, current people's guerrilla army, gods army. Had these two twin boys with them, starting when the boys were just nine years old, Johnny and Boother of the two. Finally, they came out of the jungle, smoking cigars and looking much younger in the 12-12 years. But for a while, many people believed that they had superpowers. Jason Bibetroy reported on them in Burma. He says there was actually a legend that proceeded their plans. The gratest scene Alexander Bibetroy participating in the competition is the title that year, duration of the trial of the character, Satan with the original member Satan mentally meant to have been a favorite rapper for windows to be called by colony Ablephones from.... yinolFe Jessie Umayury. The first female officer of the United States, April 21st lifetime, her age 72. The twins had to do with the vermicem ethalogy and the mythology was when the current people ethnic minority. When things were really tough for them, two twins would appear. The twins would have magical powers and they could just save them from that evil things. And what's for powers people believe they have? It twins at one time claimed and also their followers claimed twins were able to command ghost armies each twin head to 100 to 300,000 soldiers that they could command and when they were fighting at tough they could call on these ghosts ghosts who had come to support them. Other mystical powers were things such as bulls. to a bounce off of them or if they were struck by a trap from a landmine, it would bounce off of them. Jason, in the course of your reporting, did you meet people who claimed to have witnessed the twins using any of these points? Oh yes, certainly. I met several people. Many people. They told us stories about during meditation, the kids would be meditating with the twins and all of a sudden they opened their eyes and they would be an old man. and sitting there and it would be the body of an old man but inside would be one of the twins. Another one was they're going into battle. So one of the twins took his weapon since 16 pointed it to the ground and he fired 20 rounds. Later that day his troops came back and said we killed 20 soldiers. Because I fired 20 rounds into the ground. So I understand that in the course of your reporting you visited with twins. Is it twice while they were still out fighting? Yes. I visited with God's Army several times. And when you would ask the twins directly, do you have powers? Let me see the powers. Would they answer directly? Would they say yes? I have these powers or would they talk around it? They would talk around it and I would push in portion push and I would get answers . Yes, I have magical powers, but those powers only come out at desperate situations when we're in battle . I just can't bring up the magical powers to show you. What was their app at? How would they respond with the embarrass, but what would they do? I'd push with questions and then they would get irritated, they would get angry, several times, Luther lifted up a machete with threatening with it. through the translator I would get the translation that he's the safe stuff . The scary bothering us isn't he really bothering us now? I don't think I  this guy. And so what would they ? Moosa was quite shy. It's CGD. He seemed to lack of what attention and the drive to get attention. Johnny is one time out going. So, both of them were treated  kings. Both of them rarely walked on the ground, most of the time they were carried on someone's shoulders. It's interesting, so then in their little world, they were sort of super heroes. Oh, certainly. One of the kids with bark on, I want to smoke, and they would run out, grab, cigarette, light it. You want a lighter. and he wants something to eat, they'd run off and get it something. And he wanted to be listed up, they listed up, they listed up, down, they would print them down. They would bark out commands and also the commands would be here too. How do you think it affected? Did you get a sense of that? Certainly, Luther, he wanted attention. He was a boy who needed a hug. He was a boy. Didn't have his mother around, didn't have his father. They were mother figures in the camp. They didn't want women there. And they just seemed  he wanted some affection. He wanted, we'd go from soldiers, lapses, soldiers, lap and you'd just sit in the lap of the soldier or you'd come up behind the soldier and you'd quickly put his hands around and give a little hug. At the point when they are surrendered to tie troops, they write a letter to them on the letter said. In Burma we were very hungry and now we have food, the tiramisu from here. It is a nice life here. We want to stay with you. We miss you, Mom. Yeah, they didn't enjoy being in the mountain on the run. It was a tough life. They weren't well-guarged. And yeah, they missed their father and they missed their father. Your father. Do you think that the way the twins came to power in this? that a part of them believe that they might have magical powers. It's very difficult to say they believe that they were special, they were treated special. I don't think that the Johnny or Luther believes that they had magical powers. I don't know if if I were a young child and I were told that there was this legend that I and my twin were going to come and that we would have these special powers apart of me. probably would believe well I don't know the power right now but maybe in some circumstances I could. Yes you you you have a point there it's quite possible but I don't think that they believe that they ever did something magical in order I think that they were psychotic I think that they were part of a car. When you say a time you made a kind by whom I'm checking on. God is an army. This group of the currents. down and out. They needed some time from their homes. They needed people to believe them. I believe that they created the Johnny and Lusher as claiming that they were God so they they could come and people into fighting for them and they could intimidate their enemies. It's interesting. First they tried to win through politics and then through arms and then when arms fell they have to go straight to myth. Yes, that's true. They were desperate. They don't have anything left. They don't have the fighters. They don't have resources. They don't have any weapons. And the desperate act by a group of desperate people. Did it work for a while? Yes, it worked for a while. And then the Burmese forces were intimidated by the man's character. And believe this, so yeah. and they gathered a lot of support of a bunch of people and balance.
