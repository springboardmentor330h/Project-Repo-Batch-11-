Yeah, it was me Okay, that's fine I was waiting in the building for a morning Hey, oh my gosh, there's this video lab And today, oh,  what this is about to go Not only big, only two words. A story from a pair of friends, producer Matt Kilti, and from Twitter, had their right. You want to say something to them? Yeah. Or maybe this is actually really the story about Heather's need for constant validation praise. Hey, good morning. Hi, it's the most sort of  honest explanation of how this came about. You were feeling bad. I think the honest answer is sometimes. probably  more than I'd  to an embarrassing degree I feel out about myself. And I am a creative person in the profession that where there's lots of ways that you can. If you're so inclined you can find a sealed battle at yourself. There's always a list you're not on, always a sales number you didn't reach. Always a pitch that didn't get accepted. And that is your acting  you're at Yale, you've got other plans. Yeah, totally as you go ahead and ask me if I was proud that she jumped in  Michigan It was cool and he was  no, not proud Wait that but you you don't I do feel immune to all of these problems. I Maybe  kind of Sit in myself low these little bit more. I I Was I Would stop I think it's  the seeking out of a of a sort of that permission problem and feels God means to me to be a good and I don't necessarily believe in the kind of project of the sort of goal of trying to feed good. But I mean I don't think it's  that weird that I want to feel better about myself. No.  I think the question that  how might I feel better about myself is creating normal, , kind of about this normal, is it to be? It's  they're all industries based on this question. Yeah, it's  everywhere. you see it everywhere. , something real is even, it's on Instagram. , it's , as we think about Instagram, it's  how Instagram can use low self-esteem. , what are wired? What is this just mad-header therapy hour? What is this? What is this? Maybe I want to know what's going on. What is that throughout? No, I don't know. We do, okay, if you don't have a story, the header has been long time working on yours. Here's working on this. But it's about the fact that this idea is thinking of this pursuit of feeling good about yourself. Ow! So, sort of weirdly it's not that old, but I mean yeah, it's not that old. It's kind of always done a lie. And how so much of this kind of route trace back to this one guy. How do you say it, Fless? I think I think the stress function of Sess, how I've always studied. That's the time. Fless, John, that's the detailos, or maybe that's the detailos. We call it Fless, but we call it Fless, but everyone calls it Fless. I feel  I'm just thinking of this. and we had some big rubber patterns from the back there. Yeah, there was my little rice to go tell you about this. How did it go? Right. Yeah, he would love rice because he wants to make the spill with Vesco. He's the... I spent out of three hours listening to him about it. And he was , huge, huge, huge, huge, huge plastic. And I said, I think he should be the great magnety-r. He's , I'm selling it. He's selling it. He's selling it. Yeah. It was  a cigarette. It was , I'm not saying, I'm , I'm not saying it. I can see it. It's the mustard. It's mustard. And the big, , fair,  thing. Okay. So John, I should die back in 2014, and so we're not talking to the author and will store. So we'll wrote a book about the self,  how we think of ourselves, called the self-heating, self-heating, which has a whole chapter of the term. And then we also spoke to you, you work at all kinds of curious news. Question, sir. Mitch Saunders, one of John's closest friends, but I think it doesn't work. He merges as we get going there. And before we get started, I guess they just want to say, in reporting the story, it always kind of... started down, it's  an Ecarus figure. He's a kind of modern day Ecarus where he wanted so much to feel good. He wanted everyone who were world real good. But he did fly maybe a little too close to the sun. So what drew you to jump? And what I thought was so interesting about John in his early life. I was thinking his bones were very stochastic family. Oh than one 병 to get be once this Jubalsies and deeperer. it So, we got a little bit jar in this barn in 1932 in San Jose, the old street kids, his father was the one who turned in the stairs and he was just there. His mama's his dad home, she could be pretty strange. She did buy wife a hard time without the meal you could cook her. And John was a kid who's clearly very, right? Never really hadn't trouble, and was also very strict Catholic, a good Catholic boy. And the kind of good Catholic that kind of specialized self loaded. Because this is a sort of false time, that was heavy on, therefore. Just the same payment to the world, one man, a original send and the same, the idea that we're all born, centers, and in this way that came to all people, because all, same, he was raised to all, never seen, think what it is, I was brought forth in and if it's never seen that movie, I am in sin, I'm up to see, it's not shokai, it's not shokinger, someone  home or person, who touch yourself, who enjoy listening to music. any time he sets whatsoever outside of the night. It is this happening being called soning times in so many ways that he rusted not good enough from the middle floor. Each tell a story, a who has written his truth, so he's such a great story, where he ran for class president, he has great, he was by one vote. And do  what I'm saying? His own vote, one vote which is he voted for the other person, who sells that he does not allow. But he didn't stop him up to run but not enough to what a puzzle there. Yeah, he's a tangled web. When I was 33, he's personal archives and found a net of community girlfriend. That she said to him, he thinks I love most of her usual, actually, he will be , bad. This is one of his family. He's a son, records, confidence in himself. He's worried, later become class president. Attendant, the fancy private school, him, day. He's a little too short. He got me yelling. But he tells the same how he found your son clearly in the middle of the world. ushi's and makes him seem to be told to any California. He says, sure, he'll be a legend in the governor's government. Democratic governor and Pat Bra. And he would say the slater in the review that it's  this moment on this campaign where politics became quote, etched in his heart. And so, Nick. 166, the gate of 34, he runs for a seat in the California State House. On November 8, 1966. He wins. And then, well, he has this spectacular nervous breakdown. He can clearly call out for waiting to strike, so I started to sound myself. And my density in my life can utterly apart. Was there something that was supposed to be in this or what? Why? Why? I was , did I do that? , he never talked about it. to be about details of what happened, but the way that made it describe it to us, was it kind of as if John felt that he'd been being in his script, his whole life, his script was family, from his church, from society, of course. This is how he's supposed to address, how he's supposed to be, he's suddenly kind of criminal, he can say, I'd be able to be a man, maybe he didn't want to be a by that script. He was the one who liked him, he had no post to go. And after that, John realizes he says, book, and he has to find something. And so he finds this capricrease, it's also a past. It starts to ask questions , something , you see,  what matters to you, and that happened, how does you experience this? What's this new and new? Well, but , that was the first time we didn't have that cognitive thinking. The first time, it's a lot of relating. We can genuinely agree about who she was reading. It was these therapy sessions. , this... cap priest that was cracked on over and sending down the new cap. That would have actually been a space hall. Ascent is for a new station. I feel  this is a famous city. Yeah, I mean if you're a fan of magnet, that's where Donald Freper is of the other magnet. Oh, that's where he is. Ah, that's where the future is born really as lit. So the essence to this place in Big Sir, can't feel the artist on this. Nothing beauty next  John Fentler time here if you just imagine  this big Theid century house on a cliff overlooking the actually that's Edge is close there is that we had to get in the game John said the first time Scuffering the supposed to come the curves with no clothes on He actually turned him on life 쓰ice ? Etous has summer she She Buddy just come from around here. But this is  this was the point of this place. It was a place where we could go to climb the out of the where I didn't join so that I would be losing. A dark pit of misguided beliefs. Something the promise that it was a place to help you find me. Kind of realize true self and that you're doing so to find liberation, freedom, maybe even deep happiness. What a promise. Yes. You say , I don't know if I want to meet my true self. I am whenever people say that, but find my true self. There's a way that it's just sort of a family. It's , where to talk about my house, my house, my house. What is this self that somehow is taking up the garbage? Was I not my true self? Yeah, well, don't worry. We got some. the bottom of it. Indeed we did. So yeah, so no, so we didn't recognize Michael. Michael Pettett, Professor at York University, we called him. Where he studies the history of psychology. So, and Michael told us that what was going on in S-60s, is that it was sort of representative of this huge ship that was happening in the second part. Because up until this point, a lot of what psychology was, is the theme from the beginning for it. So, it's absolutely fascinating to be being that very personaged. which is the sub-trail of our sub-talk. We are high-mall air of Louis Vuitton's old-boot-seekers, ester-and-pul-de-be-all-covered half-mossels. And that even if you go and see the treatment, you see help, truth therapy, you will still be left with everyday archives. What's he called, ordinary happens? I  that. I  to do it. Oh shut up, Adam. Okay, so basically, for his, , yeah, we're all sub-ringing. this is all we're doing together. Yeah, and the best we can hope for is contentment, maybe? But a little bit after Freud and a little bit before S Cesarelli 40s and 50s. There comes this music out of the suit that we do have. The thing we can be free from our suffering, one of the second causes to sky, basically and to prove. Without documentaries, something of yourself called out some across this insect taste. and then they are going to be a little bit more difficult. And actually, what shared all of this little bit, for example, people are messy, they're impulsive. But fundamentally, people are good. And the reason that people suffer, reason that they fail, pay their own size. I found the same yearning for you, emerging, how am I, how am I, how am I, how am I, is because, personally say, I'm not really mean. People aren't even some, you're true, often, self-instead. People were suffering. This is they were trying to be here to really pitiful sleep. They thought they were supposed to be from all the moon. Just I think that I began to lose me when I was in high school. There's the young one and it's always trying to tease everybody. You guys make people feel  music. You're to make things go along smooth for the young man. Why am I afraid of it? You try to never discreet his mom. This is silly. I know it. But I can't seem to pray for the guy. I think that I've always loved people who I was together. But I've never dared put it in the work. Rajasthead, we got down to it, patient, happy patient, we tell him. But he liked that, then did play, sort of fall through. And that is what costs us, that is quickly presented outside world. Our team, you can see how this was done, young. So, Thai, Normie haircut, kind of playing role with good tactics for it. This is what people  to talk. Rajasthead developed this way. Happy, easy time this fall. This type of stuff you can get profit of being on real felt. There would become this huge part of the past. And that was the historical one. So these were often through  Wilson Town Group at Aslan. Yeah, so encounter groups, you could break from the everyday you would go to Aslan. You would be with a group of strange, you would be fighting for maybe 15 people. Don't know who has no expectations of you. So you could maybe be as vulnerable as one. And be. Rio, primary, my dear, how are we working on this morning? So John went to a bunch of these things. I think he went to eight in Counter-Sprit Service. And how it worked was? How can I not be? The school of Strayford come together for hours and hours, sometimes days and days and days on end. They'll be a group leader if they're a best to record a Paris National League of Guided Program. And what you're hearing now is a documentary that was spoken in 1972. Who's up? Heat long and counter-proof pad asking, and how it starts is the group leader. I think the light turns by 10 feet. Lays out these 10 ground through the streets. We've got a year of bombshells. That's how I want to use this for the last year. Also, don't ask questions instead be direct to honest. And one of the three, the one of the three, the three, the three, the three. And so, this 10 streamers, the sitting room, the desk, and the circle, it's crystal in theOutline's list floor. And it just sit there in silence. Clamping at each other. And then sing shit. I'm good at it. I'm good at it. Yeah, I've got a 3 million dollar. And it is wild. the group leader will get some people to punch pillows. So let up is... This is comfortable to be , hey, how about two of your wrestling chutters? They also do these exercises to try to get these people to tell each other who and how they really feel  chutters. How do you feel  themselves? It's a little pussy-to-hole point of all. this scene create an atmosphere of practical authenticity and actually these two big-down, deepens of the core of the VR. And this is the whole idea of the thing, Rogers Blost, but I hope you can appreciate that if you can feel accepted that I feel an accepted as a review really are flaws all. And you can find a way. It's great. No one will be able to have a child that will have all of them to get through. I am to begin to love yourselves. I'm not really sure that one can be married to a man I'm married. For example, in the doctor's school, we're meeting probably in the late 20s long dark hair. And I'm at the clinic every day, he tells me about me, he says, you're new to him. He tells me to have a negative his way and I find a negative, he tells me to have some deals. That on chart is five, that's very hard for me to say. And good. And they haven't looked at herself in just me or... They've talked about this. What about this? I love you. I love you. Just... And what I was trying... ...were any better than the school. I'm trying to tell one of the things that first happened for me in the CBO arts. that there was all this deep-seeded rage. These didn't want to wait. You felt it was, , you didn't want to. You just built a bad-decker car from this raging rump. And it said that John told him the first time he went to an encounter with leader just sat there cross-legged for the longest time and didn't see him and apparently John's way of dealing with detention used to go on sort of attack. That's actually been well. They ended up in a wrestling match or whatever. vision vidéo , John's so filled with the womb, whatever that expression was for. If you didn't realize that he was in, that it was okay to feel. This says that a lot of what John's through just kind of came down to me, just me seeing the health as he was as he was. When happiness, John went from button to black suit, black tie, meat hair, Johnny guy, just someone entirely, or is called a lot of stuff. say he recovered someone who he already was. While three or he grew his head he had a diabetes, he had a shock, a shock, a shock, a diabetes, and cutting out. He was always rumbling. People used to say he looked  an unmoved bed. He drove around and he was  mustard colored and burnable. When he talked down he went his right head and talked down. He'd be brash, busterly, angry, but also very sweet. People in his office had these stocks that he called Vasko Grant. His old handwritten notes from John. I'm  a newspaper article that I'm just thinking about. We're something. And I find it's little hundreds of people who get these basketball games. We got , not in this mountains, these big, expressive, everything is being stopped in crisis. We felt free, compressed every slide. And there are some crazy people who discover something that has a lot of power and makes a lot of difference in these lives. They're first and only in that situation. just to find somewhere to show. But what we get to add, well actually if we get this header, I have to go to fair, it's not the same. Maybe we're maybe so punch and pillow or have some kind of breakthrough, ? Yeah, maybe I'll have some breakthrough. Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be life-changing. I've only been telling you to go for a whole task. Look at what we get to do. I will still have not gone. I will pick back up the stories. Okay. Great. but then thumbs up and thumbs up, you're the one who was eating Let's go! all that. I said talk about them and  I can take fights in between this. I didn't ask for that. Look at you. Okay? What did regular lab that would have hurt me? That's some of the spicy news. Yeah, there were those fun words low my lid today. Whoa, embracing my true self. You don't actually hear me saying nothing. I don't know. Okay, I spoke off. Yeah. I joined those videos in the transmission with their people, Aslan, brilliant books about psychology and is still unlected. The first thing I was talking about was the most terrifying politician in the world. He probably was the most terrifying politician ever. In mid-set it was actually back in 1970. When he first encountered the conference in the same Marba, he was keynote speaker, the shuffling keynote speaker from gun up the street, John Vastershelis. His own sport coach, shirt and tie, but obviously underneath the one shirt was the move, he had some strange design. This is God Castle. This is John. This is John. First, I want to walk in front. Let's go to the specific topic. I'll point it. The second, I want to acknowledge the evidence of what being heard. And the stuff that is coming with this mouth. Hopefully our being here is next day at the chair. We'll be safe to move it all up. in themaz businessize music. The 2008 movie book was released and released before. This speech is Jon the talk about growing ataccount rate. Congratulations, Ms Michael Lawrence. Who is up? Ma'ol Timost tongue, something you got客 voice. , this magazine documented you everytime from a Clinttsman Right next to Adrienne Glabara's Self-ricting provision. I never heard of talking exactly, irreversible mix axle gotton. time. and he was talking condoms and choir and I don't need exactly what we talked about but it caused the impact conversation I asked him and he said, the two people in the department I just not had the exposure that anybody was listening. The first thing he did is he agreed and that he came and he did quite a part of the machine for me. , that was, it must have been 82 in case and from then to the company died in 2015. And I guess what? What exactly was it that we were seeing, that each group wanted to be a mentor? It was just one of our particular in the two lines, the psychology and how we are formed, in the groups, in the true family, which is the all-buries in the sense of the community, come into the sense of how that plays out in the world. And then the thing really important is how we were applying. and in his philosophy to the world of power. Because for him, everything to be known all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, to live and crack it. This based on some real family of nation. All of us, we do with the yarn. My value is, and I just want to tell you more. What I do so so it's really, really, really, both of us. That tree is the hardest model in the nation. Stayed now, but it's about money, but probably the power, not those that this would be. In John's nested. with these pilots, and talk that for us, liberating vision. Our business team is entering for our parent's politics, and a guardian, our intimacy, our diet, all around. That's what they think about the nature of different ones. This means dear to imagine that all cynical, this is what people are facing, people are not facing dangerous. The people creatures are moving by a mission soon. We gain prep, change the corporate clock away, then we approach false, new, new importance. social institutions and other women. Just that one view of human nature for John. If we had a personal approach, if we were to have people to go, we need to find all our faults, all our efforts. And we have that very hard, and it's very something that the people that are using at the root. That positive, good, helpful, helpful, beneficial, good literature for the people. Do have whatever is a part of life as well. all of them, they're not the loser, they really brace crawler just the ureth, he moves in white plants, they're given the right conditions of almost always oriented to the sun, they're deemies that you're not screwed up and all the rure to what causes them to damage around you. But the problem here is, this is thousands, liberating visions from forever. what does any of this actually mean in terms of how would policy,  this, the hairy hind- guy kind of thing. Yeah, what is used to him? Listen, I have anything that he can actually put all of that in that might actually affect policy until something shows up. Yes, what that might be, not it. To a little word, I'm with a little high person self-esteem. There it is. Because it was in the 1980s, this is the first thing emerges. This phrase, take the air, stop the steam. and the first is reception of their own work. It starts becoming part of the public consciousness. Absolutely. And I think I want to just kind of talk a little bit about where that phrase comes from. Yeah, because it becomes so... Yeah, I do  what you'd question where that being from, where did that phrase come from? So Michael Petty, our history professor, explained it in psychology, self-steem goes back to eight to nine to book called the principles of psychology. Which basically says that softsteem is the step. This self... The things that you have, based on the things you do, the things that you care about it, for example, things that you can't just back then. I don't think I'm the best walks through in the world. So, some is a better walk through than me. No big, but instead of walking with the other person, is a better, more famous, her achieving psychologist. That does hurt myself, that does hurt myself in it. With Michael explained it, whereas this is at a time psychology where the self was not car s f8n was just kind of  parts, you have different parts, different aspects of a self, and then you had these different things where you might find word for value in theory. It's  you almost state your territory, where you're identity and value, why? And it's , and all the other places, it's  you've seeded that territory,  it's okay. Right. But then in the 30s or 40s, the very idea of the self-changers. That's called just one of the ideas of personality, which is your unified. and so it's all the same becomes a more global basic attribute of the person. It's no longer  how do you feel about these individual things you're good at? Now, that I feel about you that when either had high self-steemed or low-soaks. So, for psychologists, the first thing comes really important measure of a person's entire wealthy, their whole mental health. And one of these we come past in was that in pivotal 1984 Brown people were in segregation case. One of the crucial argument. made by the opponents of segregation. What is it all? This is for God's study. Yeah, I've had rock children, because for a white doll, over a black. And this shows how they internalize the society's negative attitude towards themselves. The stereotyping that they've sort of been given in low self-steam by society. Michael says it's also right around here you can get mass-low and the famous hierarchy per Earth. época. about whether it's actually hard to know a bit. I have a controversy. I always see it's a pyramid. It's a pyramid, but Maslow Nits himself never drew it as a pyramid. That comes from a dad's mid textbook, a couple of decades later that's right to Paul Converting. But then. So Maslow's whole thing is that you have all these other needs, and they all need to be fulfilled in order to become the best version of yourself. It needs  food, water, sleep, security, stability, friendship, intimacy, and puzzle of souls hombre a felt an altar A So, set to circle each other and become this much bigger thing. Because once going on the 80s was... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... I will tell you about my silence and crime. My fellow newslight is 21. Which is the crack that can make the very serious matter. The incidents between A's friends. Team pregnancy is a horrible uncocting off of the British problems for more often. And for John in California, he said, that's what was really so good. These became the issues of the day. And what happened? It's been a course of a lot of five weeks period. Some kind of things came together. One day, he was leaving out. So, how it was at the gate, he did a fast school, looked at his black soft face. That self-esteem is going to have a good school. But I read both of his bloods, but the black soft, reasonably high, or against the table, all the black and brown, don't think I'd be with preventive children. And maybe some steam was a key component in white and orange and cards. There's a key to them saying, please don't think right. This is public psychology, sex education, or fake. The greatest is probably a lot, but kids were maybe half distracted and early age so they could feel better about themselves. So go 3, draw a great thing, powder with someone's up and he matches on some self-esteem as a focus team. Because what all this challenge and what self-esteem is done is that at the root of Mr. Varsation Games, we'll keep it in the beginning and in the end we'll value it. So, we're 1984. It was the chairman of the Ways and Ways and Ways. John can told the budget of California. The 15th of August to come in May. And it goes to the Governor of California and he says, Look, I need to spend money on a task force, a task force to promote self-esteem. Yeah. So, what was the initial reaction to this idea? The initial reaction to massive skepticism. So, it's a idea. So, right in real story, explained that the Governor of the time he was the known system. Yeah, the representation in very hot. What's the texture of this one? This is what we're going to do this way. We can take three people from our group, from our 10 people from our school, seven from our attic. We'll stay in texture, they will fall. possibly, it's a really cheap way to make a snazzy, better, and constantly. Certainly a cheaper way than  raising the minimum wage. Something in the house. But the other thing you tell the governor is that this will also promote personal. in social responses. So this is the , the ages part. Yeah, I mean, the way you think about it, you talked about the slots, teachers is , if you pay a lot of money for something, you value something, you tend to take care of. No, no. And so, just applying this basic logic, right, if you value yourself, you'll take care of yourself. And it actually might be the obvious societal changes because let me sense, let me sense. And so, 很有,很有. I didn't know exactly how I got to. You've got to help them act together. You had tests,'' I could go do some technical ones because want to---- You got to do some methodology, they could just teach you, not teach you them. We need a group of things to improve. It's all right, I had to novice  you're going to get them, and don't create the self-esteem task force. The task force to promote self-esteem. You do John, for you and by the name of the name? No, I had no. This is Emmett Miller, former member of the task force. To ensure how he discovered me, except I was widely known for having invented concept of mind-bodies and publicity treatment of my patients. And there were people  Emmett? They got mother of family therapy. They won't even have anything to do together. The next time you have a type to take at home. Some other people from Aslan, but also... Black Rock White's great game is his pop star of this person's future. The Slum's Smolfen. Is it taken to one for maybe? This is the Slum's Smolfen. Oh. So, 1970s, the good people would get together. It round people, kind of setting. I  to write something. And the group would find it here in the last few weeks. The first psychologists did read and see me. Publishing. Air B practices to put together in principles of what they might call healthy self-esteem. Everything that is not common. They even hired researchers at Berkeley to devise studies. Looking at us, it's a picture of every of the people. I'm violent. I'm all of the... Cheese pregnancy. All the new welfare dependency. I'm so... The cutting is this question. Guys having high self-esteem. Actually, people to be better. Serves. being more successful. Now, well, that's going on. Do  about Dean's very lot of games? Very, very. Talk to you about the standards today. How insulin, insulin, and so on. That's a trick. It's a power that these Dean's districts can have. It was an almost every week's paper. Everybody read it. They're Gary Tudos and it's Gary Tudos. Well, Gary Tudos with this very clever, Dean's very smart and smart too. In 1987, you found out about the task force. The task force. decided to make jokes about we are crazy to you, character, barber, booksy and bookstown. There was an LA actress, there was a medium who had been vise to the task force on base for 20s' movie, that ourselves and as unfortunately, he's just , joke after talk about this task force and it's really content. In this goes on, let's do it wrong, day and fall, just making fun of safety task this to a回 color smaaà Hello, everyone, welcome to review this review wrong Indin you and all of them are really good. And all of them are really good. So what happens? Wow! So it is broken a pixel post-to-stitch who said Caliphany to state this dairy gram keeps them from sister boom boom where they're at. Right in church, he's Charles Matson, the Essence and now a government task force to herself asleep. Now there's one more Caliphany church Caliphany to Caliphany to Caliphany. John. Row. Four. Five. all of the books that are sold, which hurt, and it's angry. But the thing is that deems very straight about the task force, that what else is that? It's how everyone comes out about it. That's what made it famous. We spent three years in. At the end of this three years, 1990. The results were that when compared people who lived their lives, and this real self, the steam, they're so much better. People had so stingy. It's a bit unscrupulous, well-prepared, and they were in a screen of climbing climbing, substance abuse. So they put together this report. It was back report that yes, self-esteem does indeed closely, this amazing effect. They publish it and there's a complete one eight. Next on holiday, yes, John Masks, so it follows them. John Masks tells us, no, he's lost it. People want self-esteem. I'm 90s, and you're giving me one more time. I'm a thought going up there. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. with speeches. We are a global currency. The deal for you are a set in such a unprecedented may have happened last long. Time next. Sneeze tech to cheat. Really  what you're doing. I think you're right on Facebook. So it's time. And it's pretty long. Very tiring. Task force for it. This report has rolled 50,000 copies. Every one, all over the state, in the former major of the world, Steaked, about self-esteem. Did anything change in the interim  in those three years that would make them more accepting the idea? I mean, I guess, I still think we just want to know that these cults were ready for. I think there's a couple ways to understand it. For me, the economy actually pays a big pause for this. Well, says that in 80s, cross the West, you see anti-union politics, increasing privatization, the end of social safety, and calls for personal response to it. And that had a...so-for-the-seek. impact on who we were and how we understood world's view. The best way to stop up is to see about who we were, not just five or six, nine things as far as we were, and we were, and people, to let to this, to assume the man and to do this to people, to be a good, to material with God, what he should see, to great stuff was yourself. And also, right around the same time, you have stop-out moments, you went to stop. What's becoming? and the spirit of the world. The spirit in the spirit. So what do you think about the spiritual spirit? So these ideas we've already come about there in the culture. And I think you see the structure of the self-esteem. And it's a 75, it's not totally where. But in the Middle Ages, this idea of Iron and Naze is the last two of our problems. I just feel  the culture is ready for it. And also, things with realizing, I'm here to look at the self-series. So the therapy is also the key to the speech thing. And this is both in the 80s that basically says that now modern equivalent to salvation in heaven was meant of help. The role that I know not when you start the job that you are getting, that's when it all comes, that's from the working point of time, that's the key. So all of these things came together. And this exact right moment, John is step on the scene and just be , hell. I have something powerful, this social vaccine, self-esteem. They can help all of us. But what does that look ? And translate that into meaning, rock, and the world. It wasn't happening. It was never a content of just shooting the show from the start. Just talking to you. You had it resolved from something you didn't do. So, you're feeling very well back to you. You said, we have those 78 years. This is how it turns out. That's coming up right after this short break. Okay, what did 3D lab that was header and math themselves? Okay, so John Scott, social vaccine, right? Question questions , well, how do you not get excited? What are you? How do you ask these? How do you do these? How do you teach people to fail their reps? It's John. The Mahabharata Probeur is a education from the Ramirez car in the answer wise. Dr. Meen, the sophomore, or the 12 startup schools. The education and the carvings of the 12 out. The 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 12 out, the 10. And so, in the early 1990s, the students pushed to get self-steam into the classroom. Hey. and suddenly we were all these  workbooks, textbooks. So here's one called the Steam Builders, a place where it's the Steam Grid. Or the best self-steer activities for the elementary grades. Building self-steer secondary school tutors and more and more self-smilmeters. How this work was, let's say, at past kids, every nine or four important learning of back there, and yeah, for now. To be whatever grade and a teacher would have one least works. What's in it? It can just watch it. Today we are going to do some today we are going to talk about yourself and how a lot of this again is meant to be linear. But tiny bit of the case that you're just really is question, what is it? Who am I? I was , why are you? Why am I? Why am I? I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. What makes it different? my first thing I tell in this band what needs you? yeah I love this song I  to sing basically who is this person that is the self? okay good do  what's the most of them? yeah I think it's some of the things that you  to sing and then you want to sing and then of course this is the ton of stuff about water build strings yourself and then you want to hear how my style got out of it or something  ours. Every person is the school gets gold medal for something. They are really great. Everybody gets a trophy. What would your goals be? What would you do? Spring, go out. Everybody get together. There were things called sharing circles. I'm in  encountered groups, but for kids. Oh, that's sweet. They know, yeah, we do each other. No, we do  what? Makes you. You do. Tell us about what you felt good. What's one of the best things to happen to you? Okay, no. Everybody knows what it's possible. If there's a lot more with annulable things. But who's an ugly girl? Can't we see sake with you? Hello, guys. We just moved on. Splitting over yawn, the outfit. And it was even better. All of you wereينed. What would you do? She used to be pretty. She's been very foodie. A pretty normal gentleman. She used her whole body. But sometimes it's , YOU CANNOTA THIS... THAT THEY CONN этом doo from you. right? How? What are Sparkle statements? So, this comes from both the Steam Divers and they are a long list of statements you can make to a classmate. Yeah. So, you're cool. I  knowing you. Let's play together. Hope today is super for ya. You're my friend. You're a good buddy. Matt, I'm gonna have a friend to sound and put it stick it next to your desk. I know somebody could use it for you more Sparkle statements instead. Yeah, maybe we should be a little bit less Sparkle. And this would be , what fast is this smart intake? It worked this for the stepping delight and your regular class. , all room coming there. Yeah, and runs through, I mean, this is  programming that is available to you. Well, I was saying, I had it every year. I can remember. What do you remember? I remember, I remember D.S. O. The Dolphin never heard. Looks  this is Dolphin. Which is this Dolphin puppet who taught us to film good and bad herself using song. Okay, okay, I'm trying my- But I also did this Polygon Instagram to see it. anyone else remembered some more things. Yeah, also I got my friend, Les and James, Grew and LA and Earl Nines. We always call them put-ups and put-downs. That was the name for, , saying something nice, somebody for a season name. And she said her teacher, this was  maybe third grade, had this policy that if someone was to put down, the thing was, you had to  go to this little patio, this back patio, and the person gave you the put-down. had to give you five. But, oh wow. So , counters it put down. It's  you and the bush up. Oh, yes, punch into praise. Hey, oh hey, how are you? Good, how are you? I also worked on this woman's tag. You peg kinder from Chicago, but this wild story. It's , 1995. This one I was in eighth grade, but I hope there was this teacher who every morning after the Pudge of Allegiance and Enouncements. She had a handwritten sheet of paper. There are two stanzas of I have come. and she had the bold gusto. I had a lot of fun. So make a whole A-grade class, sings two stands. I had fun, and it's free. Go on again. Chris, I, go, see you. I had fun, and it's in me. And sometimes twice, we saw that one last time. One more time. It really is  the anthem, the softestly anthem. We had this thing called star attraction. Another kind of mind-jane personality. She was 90's kidded. Southern California, and I still have. is poster which is insanely worth. This is being also with Jane's second grade picture right in the set. I have this  horrible bang and all around the picture are these stars where her classmates had written something. Jane is nice and fair. Jane is love. That's funny. Jane is nice, funny, smart and good. Mmm, yeah. I think that's right. We got to come to Super, to write home and post. There was Amy Cooper and which talk is this? Other affirmations? Is there affirmations? This is poster. around your bedroom. Yep, disposed around my bedroom. I was smart and kind of students. I respect all. They're my friend, Dean of Penn CEO. I grew up in Bromere, New Jersey. And we were never learning about I I A L A C I M, loveable and capable. I mean, even our writer will store our own evades. We have to go around and stuff and everybody has to say something good about it. So, see you at the stuff over a new kit. Just  an education week article from 1991, look, please out till this point already. thousands of schools are studying for the self-sense curriculum that are over a hundred textbooks to promote self-sense classrooms, so it's decaying and raised by the educational system in a major way. Throughout the 90s, self-esteem became the dominant link that people who ask for use to talk about themselves. The use of the scenes are part of childhoods, successes, failures, their missions, just how they thought about who they were, and for John. personal venture and honest, this is  kind of a street there. What are these companies for the club? You can do the service, you can do the business, try it out and you can't do the right thing. You're right, you're ready. You're an exchange, you're targeting, you're living with all the rest. When you have your own mind, you're going to be free here. You're giving, you're coming, you're going to go and have a good time. But that pretty short talk about the lie of it. So this is part of the story which we told you. Yeah, this is all a fraud. I'm waiting for the fraud. Yeah, the lie. Yeah, this is  Wells' whole thing in this that one of the things he discovered for the fuck is that in the O'Con I managed to find a duty or accept clothing because he actually will be sitting where the cow clerk and research are hired by the task force or send this. And he told the task force back in the internet, yes, they had found some compelling correlations, self-destruct, and education. Another error is the correlations that seem to be so great, we're not quite sure why. And we're not sure where we have correlations, what the cause is not. Let's take for example, one of the areas where findings are a little bit loose, just a little bit focused, even out on the abuse. By now, you're a post of correlations, who looks at the internet's cause. The least people does it drinking because of an early Easter, still doubt certain degradation works in so long. Or is it the other way round? Does the involve the outcome of the years of decades constitute the cause of the basis for the fittings of the works that we discovered in deep and happy and cold in that? So, he's basically saying, we have some of Tay Correlational links, and of course, we all know Correlational, isn't Consection. I do say that others, but other links are not so Correlational, or we do have Correlational. He got to ask that guy's question, what's causing what? And he was , when recorded, I mean I just said, he got to get about correlation from station. And he said, he got to report to the end of a telling. He said, nobody can watch that, he never watches that, certainly he never watches that. And yeah, that's exactly what they get. And www beneficiary.io politician! and it's transparent about all this. Or do you necessarily want to actually meet your service? It happens. It hurts, but research, how to uninterpreter and constantly challenge the market. You have to respond that it's easy to get in. When it gets to pencil through this kind of knot a knot, you will just kind of not want to stay straight through the first thing you can do. You can go ahead and do the combination. You can set the charm of many things that can save you and you can use words. John's low, Jesus and his son. And so through the 90s and John's going around saying that, Sub-seem is so so bad. He was doing it, seemingly knowing on the basis of nothing. And so what would happen was that in the early 2000s, the very second foundation of Sub-seem movement started to collapse. , I was more of a oblivious to the Sub-seem movement. It's , you weren't on. So I knew that people worried about it, people would say, well, yeah, I love some similarities with Pablo because he can't do anything about your situation and so he's such a student. And , I will take the data of consistent idea. So, jumper basically spent an entire academic career. And I'm a first-ever student studying first. Carlos, you need to be free, I hope. and Jennifer told us about how in 2003 there were psychologists, controversy researchers who put together a very mind, I think, really excellent overview of what is the body, what is the benefit of soft skin, it would prove decades whatever research is published, hundreds of studies. So look what all the differences between high and low soft skin. And what you see is that, , soft skin is correlated with a great school, it's poorly to win. How attractive people find you, but these are tiny associations. So basically it turned out a lot of what you've been playing in that task list for was just really not. all the clean therapy can solve, self-steaming, self-steaming, self-steaming, that it was a cure for drug use, alcohol use, high violence, teen pregnancy, or academic performance. This reason showed that whether you're higher wills of seaming. It wasn't causing these problems. Right. Right. And so  weird, , you're telling me the science of this. And that it's  the skewed study. as I'm hearing this, I'm , it's  the story logic of it. Whoa, so hard. And it makes that into a sense. It makes such intuitive sense that it's , why wouldn't it fit in better? Why wouldn't my release fit in better? I, I, it's. So hard to , to sludge it, even when you're literally telling me it's all. Okay, well, I can tell you one thing, the basics, heard about, I mean for the speech with the highest of speech, you were grow cells, these languages are high substance people. Take them, smarter, more successful, more problems, better, more popular than low substance people think they are. And spite of the fact that they're not really any different families that see people in these objective ways. Basically the people have self-steam. Right, feels good to me. The genie. That seems good. That seems good. That seems good. That seems good. That seems good. That seems good. But what genie-proof it's said is, Well, I think it's not a language being published. Yes. a portrait. You're happy. That's meaningful. But our emotions are central to how we experience our lives. But that's not all we're supposed to be. Because that's not all we're supposed to be. is the downside to high-sum's scene, which is what? Well, research shows that people really high-sum's the tendency to defend their positive-dues and soft-sum's, as you see, high-sum's, as you see, high-sum's, as you see, the things  the functional, gross-home. , okay, that makes... Yeah, totally. , they found that in education, so themselves, the programs, produced actually that complacency, produced effort, was just used to any sort of critical meat feedback, and then these generals were so obviously not. 10 or 15 years, I was really interested in what people base their substance demand. We found out that pretty much everybody base their substance. So, generally the study of nursing and nursing, with students who were attending to a powerful college school. And what they found was that for the students who tied their self-worth to high academic treatment, when they got rejected from that school, their self-steem obviously went down. I work so Moscow of the students that would have to stay down for several days until something happened to kind of shake them out of that. And for many of the students they were shown more science regression. Whereas the kids weren't tying us up the same to that, that them achievement, then when they didn't get into programs, they , whether to stop. And then the other thing that was very interesting is that the students were suffering as well as this on the other steps. But we asked them what would it mean for... about you to get into graduate school. They would write things , ah, it would prove once in a while that I am brilliant. I am great. That I am successful. It would prove something about me. In Jennifer, stirring shows you the state of law. The self-steam. It's just that if I have earned high-substream today, I have some success in it. But when you realize that how about earth loves a soft steam tomorrow, if I have a theory, what do you think about your succeed at CD? Is that actually mean kind of worth it? But I don't know that. And she told us those common technologies in the 90s and 2000s. And this requires that soft steam is the worst sickness known to human kind. Because when you succeed, you are great, but when you fail, you're shipped. So, today's important is the big New York Times Sunni Manacing Discard. Shobbles and kind of tearing down, zarn and past-bores, and promise to dream of self-steem, justify a person off at peace in the early times, this can be the same thing. So, it's a big sign to the American article, called, exploding self-steem myth. Yeah, this is  when self-steem comes to, yeah, so every kick is trophy, participation and that'll hold, right. This is what... and all of that sets become  very progress and how we think about such things. And there's actually online, so all these published emails that jar in some of this friends in the room to one another, in weight, and all of this, and apart from yet, it's, , Johnston's emails that didn't know, apps. And you see, you can easily, , point point with photo, times piece, nothing to do with flight back, or take on, disignulis the story. Right, say! you But it's just big John theme he's really fighting low enough. he's  the Japanese soldier fighting on that island  out in the war zone. I mean he never really stopped fighting. Yeah, never really stopped fighting. I mean there's two thousand I interviewed with San Jose inside which is this new super place in his head. Right. And in it is put it. saying how all of the world and role of self-steem is quietly recognizing that. I think it's really proven to be all the thought of words in more which feels so cool  it feels delusional. Yeah, yeah, that does happen. And I think I had an eye reporting story and  learning more more about John's sort of  it almost, if you're sort of desperate in a way and I think it's because for John. Who grew up in the space for Pat Family who was the pauses of felt  this enormous sort of weight? This constraint, this thing made him feel fun and he clawed and broken back. the shed all of that. These ideas of self-esteem was  so vital and important to his sense of self, to his sort of well-being. And you do feel  you're a step-craft. Do you feel ... ... ... I don't know, if he was a person very committed to personal growth, do you feel  he ended up being a man he wanted to be? I say yes and no. I think he was a man to be his friend and he was a great person. He was a lot of him that was in the gun. And I'm pretty sure he was disappointed in me. Although I used to love the jeans. I was keeping the view, the eye to hear that of the body to me. Listen to you, you find this, you might see something  that. That one will be in the teeth. Do you think he had Christ or the Steve? I think his own stuff to see, and he, for Joe the other, was, and the wonderful struggles for something new, is that always power, always something, always. accomplish the number one, twice the opportunity, just constantly, the masses, the masses, the earth, the whole thing together. Hmm, I think that we do this moment. So, freedom is the only way to get me this time. And he'd come and come and be down. No, but just be ready for us to be. This is... the most common Twitter within the community. Which is the Twitter movement of the medicine, which is the editing and watching the community. How do you think he tells about how he was treating the people around the tent, with his aim for that? From big blind spots. Oh, really? He did get that out of it, especially soon. He said he used very, very gamey to clean up his mess, but he could be very embarrassing to not do that. And post-part tackies, no, he's very concerned about what he's... the tendency of somebody brought a British History but was taken away, who is out of control. We have to wait tough, we've started to appreciate the time of history. When doubting harmony, love, and to make the story more alive and we can never realize – ... B- I never thought of anything to be able to do. I never felt  I was an intimate one to one relationship. That was just it. And every single one of them are, they've called for me, and they've just, they've almost failed, because he's long, and he's so close with him. The bestity that was one night's Eve. And so sad, and which I was this, point in the friendship where mid-Solderm look how about you become a member of our family. And that was our counter. Nice. With that, thank you. Oh, right, , keep my kids grew up with something strong round-eyed and tongue-women, and while I'm listening to the occasion you would hear a health kind. Two is not thinking we can listen on especially when the session is out, even the session is in. Be prioritized and spend time with me. Who's it? and were in close with people stealing from, it stended from the shop, there were three families from through their figure of PsychoS Sleep, they never had Zen, their intention to be Baekctory, become San Diego swimsuit Iü, but they hide the old, they are bringing them away. The last day in our store bed, you found a phone with a phone. You found a phone with a phone and a phone. You found me. This says the C-2014 and it was when John's diagnosed with a really aggressive point. You want to be back home, some dumb-back home, got my hospital. Can you go over to his house to see, often, yeah, every day, every day. Let's go. What was that  to sleep every day with you? We'll remember something. I had it not that easy to be. He was the most atonement of being by the city, not long ago. The last few days of his life, his dream worked on together with his two footing that he was afraid of giving one foot down to the African-Bundies. And he was just a friend of done in the entire examination. people take you last birth to, especially the conscious. You can be very hard to actually let go, not to the member who is terrified. So really, we practice and people are in the turn of just pain practicing, how to let the longer and longer periods with the routine taking into. And have you feel, still do, in his worst pain change. and his own reactions of fear and take him off. Mitch says it was in way May of 2014. Her people whose posts fall into the present realm and the world has been close to the time. And on, he insists that she, he needs... This is the guy in the 30s we went to Aslan with terrified of being naked. When everyone was going to those police turn around and clap because he just called so shameed and humiliated about his body. She wanted to talk about it. find everybody soon taking forgiveness and so dismissed but after Zachary WPA take ab sacchipus medicine or do farming do misine laboratories You can always give And did that last breath and what was that was you? That was made from 4th 2014. Sometimes. I have found myself keep eating. She's sort of thinking about what John did. And what parts of it are still with us now? I do think self-steam movement has had a good effect, right? Again, you're passing my competitive. I definitely think he had a psychologist self-taught. He is much more prevalent and available. Now, then for my employer, since emails all the time are about my mental well VA, I'm going to be eating. and offering the old, , here's a meditation class, , on campus this takes place. So the language mental health, mental wellness, even more prominent, ever-for-for-for. Yeah, and I think the technical ideas to everything you all feel to be established. After it will start, I always think about this stuff called, which is, and that's good when I was a student. So, , what am I just, especially, is reality's kind of a shit. , you're watching me out, you're , you're just blocking the note deck. A big brother, and 70-day hysterics. They're very speak-for-your-feet from this big machine. I'm just saying, well, I think, , it'll be my truth. Yeah, it'll be my truth. And I still have a path right here and I'm not focused on the rest. But I think maybe the biggest, maybe even the most important legacy of Don's work is actually that I've been in the schools. So last year, I don't know if you just want to be in the school. Yes, to do nothing. I feel  I still asked if it works. So we can see how psychology gets used in classrooms today. And today, if some steam is taught in class, it's pretty time. And instead, we're just messing up. What's in the classroom to cross the country? It's this thing called S-E-L, social and muscle work. Alright, what's going on? We're going to be discussing, all of us, let's meet the city where no one will work, fair means. We're in class first, figure. So we're going to be looking at all different situations on fair and what it means. There will be nastiness questions , when do you feel  something isn't good? I will let  how some tips are... How does it feel? We know what you're doing when someone's being saying. It's what. Tell me, it's... How's humans and is not in? How should we talk about this food? For  one time, we're always at the mall. We also visited the classroom with graders. I saw people  to be , we were doing a lesson on goal. How do you recognize goal? I mean, how do you call out goal? We wouldn't be doing the Seabull. Do  the thing that we call out? And upstanders, someone who actually helped this situation. Upstanders. Upstanders. Oh my gosh, that's what we talk with that. I know, I know. That's what happens. Right. But I think what this is is a continuation of what John is trying to do by pulling the psychology into education and just feeling. Yeah. But where it's John's books on the self, but self-value, self-worth, self-steam is happening now is focused on the other. And now this is fair. Does everyone will be getting what they need? It's not understanding with the communities that are in June. We are... Can you kidding me? Well, stop being mean to you. It's about a ten-fact motion. We can't even motion this far, just walk away. It's group what it means, top person motion is really how to make eye steps. eye feel blank. It's also , don't bully you. What is fair and it's  there's a kind of , we're in a community with people around and I love it. I  that. But so... Hey, here we are! What are the kind of amazing things about this? Is how weirdly Jeff... Well, we've had to become full of unbeclined faces that we did. The research that was that entire career looking at something kind of wound up in the same place for herself is  the school's up. What do you mean? Then what? Well, so I asked him for, I was , , being a kid in the 90s. I still have this question of , but how do you feel good? It is good to feel good about yourself. How does one find self-worth in a way? it's helped. I think by not worrying about it. It's a person of work and value. It's just not a hope for a customer. It's just doesn't do anything for you to ask that customer for other people. And a much better or more helpful question is how do I want to be? right now. But how am I going to support other people, for example? But really, that competition, what things are for larger than me is important to me. So she told us about one of the sudden she did, it was thinking at room eight. College women, she roommates, didn't know each other before the start of the first year in college. And we asked each roommate a whole bunch of questions about the relationship of the time and their substance. And what we found was that when we were with anfils, to the phantom of the human being, because that same thought that's confusing. So the human being is responsive to human needs. We make the notices, and this responsive and return. And then when we're at A, is the response again, P, and then we're at B, and we're at A. So you can drop all the virtue. cycle going on in relationships where when people are focused not only on the things but on the business concept to other people's needs. Other people noticed that they appreciated their esteem for the other person goes up and that ends up having. It's not huge in heart but remember what thought I was doing in the end. On the top of the person was a defensive influence. So for the right of Buddhist self-steem and a way back. The mind you is sustainable over time and good for the world is to focus on the wellbeing of other people or to organizations institutions on the table. The feeling that things being a harms after A lot each people areiable at people. more than where nothing one can use should oczywiście. So the same is the wrong way to focus. Because you don't have to have how soft steam to make it hot. And this is the thing that I had clearly indicated in Salah. No, I haven't. Yeah, the whole point is not trying to deal with it. So now, she's saying, she's talking about me, it's seeing me. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I hope it was me. What need to be told that you did a great job to open it all my life? Wow, we're still here. You both now have been perversed this large job thing that she said, as meeting the year right. And you're right all of them. And what was the point of end you had? Just a bit, I just feel  you're being incredibly, you're being very resistant to just sort of a basic level of shooting time. You can't. All right. Then I'll just suggest that we end this up. that's how it was on the positive note and what's in the... great recipe. This episode was reported by Heather Ratke in Matkilti. It was produced by Matkilti with this Samsung by Jeremy Gloom and edited by Pat Wolf. Original music by Ben. That's y'all there.
