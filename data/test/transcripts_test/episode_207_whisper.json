  "text": "Welcome to Human Lab Essentials, where we revisit Hashtepasos with the most potent and actionable science-based tools. And so help this helps. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm Professor of Gear Biology and Ophthalmology at Stairroast School of Medicine. Today we're talking all about goals, science, goal setting, and achieving your goals. So, when you think about goal-seeking and the pursuit of goals of any time in the brain, it doesn't matter what the goal is. It involves a common set of rural circuits. One of the brain areas is so called neglect. The neglect is most often associated with fears. How is that involved in the world-directed behavior? Well, a lot of our gold-directed behavior is to avoid punishments. It's  embarrassment or financial ruin or things of that sort. And so the amygdala and some sense of anxiety or fear is actually built in to the circuits that generate goal-seeking and our motivation or suit. Other areas are the so called eventual strideum. The strideum is part of what's called conbezzled ganglia. The basal ganglia is a neural circuit that can very simply be described as neural circuit that helps us generate go meaning initiation of action and no go. The prevention of action type of scenarios. Let me make that even simpler. The eventual strideum is part of this thing called basal ganglia. The basal ganglia has two circuits within it. The circuit is involved in getting us to do things ... get up tomorrow and I'm gonna run five miles for some important. I don't know if I'm actually gonna be there, I'm just using that as an example. Another circuit within the basil ganglet is a no-go circuit. It's the one that says, no, I'm not going to go for the second cookie or the third cookie. I'm not going to eat that and then the goes circuit would be the one that's responsible for. Instead eating something else. Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits within the basil. So we've got a mix of the ingredients. Here in anxiety and avoidance, we've got the basil. So ganglia, which are initiating action, preventing action, and then there is the so-called cortex, cortex outer shell of the brain, two sub-rejects that are ball, gold-directed. Hader, one is the lateral prefrontal cortex prefrontal cortex, walled in so-called executive function, it's  planning, thinking about things under different timescale, so not just what we want, we need to turn, but what might want, parle over the next day, and how we're actually currently here to relate, future, and the so-called orbital frontal. cortex. Hovered up from the cortex has a large number of functions, but one of the key functions of the Hovered up from the cortex is involved in meshing some emotionality with our current state of progress, and preparing that emotionality to where it might be when we are closer to goal. Okay? So, there are basically four areas. One involved in anxiety, one involved in emotion, one involved planning, and another involved in this go-go-go action. Okay? One involved plays. Over collaboration with the Hovered up from theутьfrom-withoutالم event of alternative resentment which for more mental breakdowns are related. There are bereits. me this even simpler out to this one more time. Think, is I fear, segala, second is involved action and inaction, remember go and no go. So that's the days of Julia. The other one is involved in planning, thinking, cross the time scales, so that's lateral critical critical criticals. And then the fourth one is involved in emotionality, where we sit emotionally at present, and where we think we will be emotionally reach some particular. goal and that's the core bit of important things. What is going on in these circuits can basically go down to two particular things. First is value information. Trying to understand whether or not something is really worth pursuing. Other component of this neural circuit is associated with action which actions take, which actions not to take given the value of two or three goals given moments of time. We're going to hear me say over and over again in this episode. all you information about it is so key. Here's what. There is basically one neural transmitter of word rather, a modulator system that governs our goal setting, goal assessment, goal pursuit, and that is the neuromodular, dope. dope. dope, I mean is the common currency by which we assess our progress toward particular things of particular value. In fact, dope, I mean is the way that we assess value of our progress. There are basically only three or four elements. goal setting, goal pursue. Basically an individual or set of individuals has to identify a specific thing that are going to attain assessment of what whether or not what is making progress towards those goals, second, but necessary step. And then there's the business of goal execution. That brings us back to the neural circuit part. Remember, the neural circuit, evolving those four things earlier, the omega was straight and the root of the cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. They work together to divide the whole process as an of the genie body. to general categories. First is assessing value, knowing whether or not where one is at given moment relates to some external or things going well or knowing how to engage that matter. And then action steps, goes and know, do more of this, do less of that, do this, go to certain. So now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience. And as we do this, I'd  you to keep in mind what are some things that you either are called. or that you'd  to accomplish one. Because as we do this, we can build toward a set of protocols that, and you'll be able to very quickly plug in your particular goals and route those particular goals that's grounded in the science, and I think are going to be very effective in allowing you to reach the goals on quickly and with the lesson. In fact, let's start with a tool now. First thing to do is to understand difference between a very personal space, extra personal space. Very personal space. is a key concept of a science because you have particular neural circuits in particular chemicals that are geared toward what are called consumatory behaviors. Meaning using things and consuming things and enjoying things that are a year immediate, peri-person space. Within my current peri-person space is my inter-oception, my understanding or perception of my internal body. So breathing, heart rate, the aliens on the surface. Skin, etc. But also... So within the confines of my peri personal space, it's this coffee mug that listen to this, see this, but I'm looking at my coffee mug, I'm taking this coffee. It's a Sumatory Behavior, I have the coffee, I don't have to do much, or motivate much, you get it. Contrast that, the so-called extra personal space. Extra personal space, everything being on the confines is pretty rich. How we feel about it, is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and now even though the goals of the future. If we are going to evaluate whether or not we made progress or yesterday or not, that's in evaluation of how we feel immediate peri-person assistance. However, moving toward any goal involves orienting our thinking towards the extra-person assistance. I'm just going to see a little bit of the later conversation by saying that when we focus on an external point, we are in a process of extra-oception. The focus on the extra-person assistance is not the peri-person. Work at NYU in particular in the laboratory of phenomenal research or psychology department by the name Emily Bell set as B A L C E T I S and we Bell set as done really nice work on this They've done is they've had people focus their visual attention on a goal line of some sort and then To engage in some sort of behavior that requires a lot of effort long and short of these studies is that when people have to focus their attention on one location. They are much more effective at reaching the goals and they achieve them with the perception that they expanded last effort. And what they did is they had a group of people exercise wearing 15-pound ankle weights and they had to basically move a certain distance or run a certain distance to reach the goal one. One group was focused on goal line, visually focused on goal line. The other group was not told to visually focus on the goal line. What they found was that group. that focused on the goal line was able to achieve reaching that goal with 17% less effort and that he got there 23% quick. Simply by looking at the goal line, does something to the psychology and end physiology that allows them to move forward with less perceived effort and to do it. So what is special about focusing on visual attention? That actually? It turns out that we are two branches of our system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different patterns. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point that we call a virgin side. So we're focusing very intensely on a given point. Regardless of how far away from us that is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits, they're involved in resolved fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. The other pathways through the vision. system. This is called Magnus-Eller pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking you global information about lots of things that are happening around us. Move into things to our right, move to our left, it's happening down the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with a work of attention. You focus your eyes on a particular location, blood pressure goes up, and there are some other systems that are coordinated with it. Great body. start with this. Is that a little low-mounted term? This is a little bit of a adrenaline further ready to use your body action. Conversely, when our visual system is the mode of looking at everything, aperture of our visual system is very raw. We know that there's also a reduction in our goal-directing and a reduction in one pressure. What many of you are probably thinking was, okay, well, that's some physiology, there's some psychology, but how do you actually apply this towards setting and achieving goals? Well, do that by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are always either decisions, very personal space, your sessions, the state, or towards the outside, then you also have the ability to dynamic travel back and forth. If you already know what goal you want to pursue maybe it's a workout maybe it's a cognitive work of somebody to pursue. Again, the process is very simple. We're going to focus your visual attention on one point beyond your very personal space or the... If you're going to be on wall, it could be a horizon, it could be at a distance. And you're going to focus your visual attention there, and with some effort, hold your visual attention for a distance of seconds. You might link, that's okay, but you're going to try and hold your visual attention. So moving your head around, no diverting your attention. Again, it places your brain body to a state of readiness, and then the idea is to move into particular actions that bring you closer to your wall. Okay, we haven't yet talked about how to set goals, and how to assess podcasts. This is simply... how to pursue goals. But the visual component is important in fact, I would argue that visual system and harnessing your visual attention to. Nero point is going to be the most effective way to get your brain into a mode of action to pursue whatever your goal is. So does visualization work? Well, to prove that visualization of big wind and goals. So the super bowl, we're eight world metals in the Olympics and we're so we're so found here at an organic racks. We're forty years old or Daisy, and we're one of my purposes. Hello. How are the models whenever do you plan to give up on what're your little fellows you're with? Graduation from the University of your choice. We're making a certain amount of money Finding the partner of your choice, etc. That visualization is effective in getting your goal pursuit process started But it actually is a 3D lousy and maybe the caliper that way pursuit That much better way to maintain ongoing action toward that also involves utilization but rotten It's not about visualizing success, it's about visualizing. You look at the literature, scientific literature. There's a near doubling, near doubling, the probability of reaching one's goal if you focus with continually on or shadowing fail. You think about the ways which things could fail if you take action A, where you take action B, and instead, therefore, you take actions. If we think back to the neural circuit, associated. with assessing value in our goal pursuits. The mix alone, that's the center of the brain that's involved in the exciting fear and worry. Well, the mix alone is one of the four court components of our goal setting and goal pursuit. It's circuitry. So, while I'd love to be able to tell you that all you should think about is brain boasts and puppies, all the wonderful rewarding things that are going to happen when you achieve your goals. Truth is, you should be thinking mainly about how bad it's really going to get you don't happen. how to support in yourself, how it will negatively impact you, not in the community, it's a long term. If indeed your goal is to reach your goal. And more specific you can get by writing down or thinking about or talking about how bad it will be, don't you achieve your goals? More likely you are to achieve this. If you're going to visualize in a positive way, do that at the very beginning. You may be intermittent, every once in a while. Imagine the big win of restoring perfect on exam, winning the championship. great relationship. Most of the time, if you want to be effective, you should be focusing on a weighty failure and you should be clear about what those failures are . Now let's talk about goal setting. The goal should be significant here at all. It should be inspirational. It should be oppressive yet realist. But what does that really look ? What does that correspond to? How do we actually think about that? Turns out that the probability of achieving a goal goes up or down? depending on whether or not one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy, moderate or impossible. Turns out that if the goal is too easy, it's too within reach, it doesn't recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system to make pursuit of that goal . Also, if a goal was too long, if it was too far from that current, it didn't recruit enough to stall it, word pressure. Even if people could get very... excited about something rented. It simply didn't place their body into a state of readiness because they wasn't tangible that they could actually perhaps really achieve. So it turns out that when goals were moderate, when they were just outside of ones of media abilities, or that one felt that, yeah, that would take a lot of effort, but it's within range or maybe in range, maybe I can do it, maybe I can't. Then there was a near doubling of the likelihood engagement. the ongoing pursuit of that party. Goals need to be realistic and true and challenging. Don't set goals that are so challenging, so lofty, that they crash that blood pressure system in the other direction and make you or anyone feel hungry. Now it might be talked about three particular areas of scientific study that point to goal pursuit, goal assessment, goal achievement. Any discussion about goals at goal pursuit? Complete doubt in discussion. about the molecule, dopamine is often thought of as a molecule, pleasure and word that actually it is the molecule of motivation. It's best illustrated classic set of studies, material animals, humans, animal study, describe the fallen weight, to rats each in separate cage, and by those rats, the opportunity to indulge in something. White food, mating, or heat. It's cold in the environment who is spot cage. It's warm in the environment and so forth. You find is that rats will very readily approach the rewarding thing. Mate eats pursue something that is a pleasure. If you are to take one of those rats to heat, it's dopamine or anti-liminated. It's dopamine or anti-block dopamine. You find is that those animals will still... pill, joy, pleasure. However, their motivation to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced. In fact, placed in item pleasure, mates, food, etc. You can just wander rats' lane away from that rat. The rat, without dopamine, will not even move one length of its own body in order to achieve that pleasure. And there are naturally occurring experiments and humans that mimic that result. Very accurate. Very certain. conditions in humans where there's thepletion of dopamine, what you find is that the pletion of dopamine does not inhibit ability to experience pleasure necessarily. It inhibits an ability to pursue or go through the series of action steps in order to achieve pleasure. So dopamine really sits at the heart of our motivational state to seek out goals, to seek pleasure. And this is true for immediate goals that take place within a time frame of minutes, or tell you. day, week with a time rate of lifetime. Dopamine is the common currency between pursuit goals. Now, Dopamine does a number of things that are very interesting. It's a scribe of few of them as they were being taken to the sea. First of all, there's a fundamental feature of how our brain leases and uses Dopamine, it's called the word prediction error. The simplest way to think about Dopamine, word prediction error, is that Dopamine is giM-based Antesime. the least greatest amount in places into greater state of motivation when something happens that's positive and all. If you don't expect something positive to happen, just going about your day and something positive happens, dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released. However, if we anticipate something positive to happen and then that thing happens, we experience dopamine as part of the anticipation. So even before. get an increase in dopamine. It's not as high as it would be if something really novel and unexpected positive. But we do get an increase. And then when we actually experience the reward, we experience the positive thing, there's a smaller increase. Okay, so again, the biggest increases in dopamine are response to things that are positive and unexpected. Lesser dopamine is released when we anticipate it's something that will happen. And when... And that happens, yes, we get some dopamine, and we also get some dopamine repositive habits. There's also the case in which we predict that something good will happen. When that happens, there's an increase in dopamine, just as it was before. But then if that thing doesn't happen, for instance, our friends don't show up for dinner. Then there's a drop in dopamine below our initial base. That drop in dopamine is chemical essence of what we call this one. Now this dopamine reward prediction error as it's called can be leverage toward... trying to reach our goals because it tells us where we should set our miles to. We can't be in a mode of simply being focused on fishing. So understanding what we know about with word prediction error, we can make better choices about where it's placed miles, how far out the future is. So then the question becomes how often, or at what intervals, should one assess progress. I think they're checking in at the end of a week. back on the previous week and assess how well you could learn in pursuit of a get a goal, how many times you did something, what to do, or what it's something you want to do. I think that's a reasonable and tractable schedule to assess once a week. This dopamine system is critical to re-op to remind ourselves that we are a track in the D.V. or a track, because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation ready to continue in regular pursuit of our goals. Another very interesting aspect of dopamine is actually how dopamine system interacts with visual system. When we are focused on a particular point in visual space or it's a particular goal or horizon, all those systems are blood pressure, have an effort and then the dopamine get recruited to put us into a state of readiness, wellness, and go pursue things in that extra space. When our visual attention is very diffuse, all of that relaxes, it's very comfortable. state, place in the yard, and our periocurses. And the effect works in the other direction too. When dopamine is increased, our visual attention for particular things out in space. So the way it works is reciprocal. When we use our visual system, particular way, bring it to a point of focus, your crutes chemical and neural systems in our brain body that put us into a state of readiness in our suit. And when we increase certain chemicals in our brain body, likeapernaz killed stuff in our unit. dope. Then we also allow our visual system to be the state of looking out at particular locations. So the system works in both directions and some people leverage this by using Kathy or take  El Tire or something. And again it works both ways. There's no right or wrong way to do it. I'm a particular fan of using behavioral tools always prior to using supplementation or any kinds of other tools because behavioral tools have a very pretty much an impact on their good face. unique feature that some patients, other chemical tools, don't, which is that behavioral tools use over time, age and growth processes. As we start to practice using our visual system, harness our attention to particular locations and in that way move toward particular goals, we get better and better at using those systems. In fact, systems for focus and motivation themselves have classes, so we get better at being motivated and focused when we play service and attention. I'd  to just briefly recap what I've covered So now, first of all, set goals that are challenging the possible goals, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult, but moderate challenging goals seem to be the most effective moving people towards all of this short-term. Second, plan concretely, need a concrete set of actions that follow in order to reach goals. Third, foreshadow failure. Turns out that imagine a success, visualizing success in this world, outset of a goal and media. everyone's in a while, pursue that goal, but that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal. Rather, foreshadow failure, visualizing failure in all the terrible things that it's going to bring, seems more effective in that mouse very well to what's not about the neural circuitry involved. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors, moving distractors, getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, get that. the increase in the solid blood pressure, puts you into forward motion towards the goals absolutely. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. But I want to be sure to include a tool that's been especially powerful for me that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research. And as I described this tool next, I think you'll see the ways in which it meshes nicely with the work that Emily Bell said is college's done. This is something that I've personally been doing for many years. based on my understanding of the visual system. And the understanding that indeed we can move our cognition and our perception from a place of interception and focusing on our peri personal space, space within us, we around us, and all the things that are accessible to us. But we can shift from that mode to this mode of extra perception of focusing on things outside the context of our skin, and that are beyond our reach, so literally golderick. behaviors and goal-direct thoughts. And this is something that in the past, I talked about a little bit, I've talked about something called space-time bridging in it. You haven't talked too much about the time domain of visual system today. But space-time bridging is simply a way of using one's visual system to focus on a very personal space and interrosception. And then gradually, in a deliberate way, stepping one's focus into the extra personal space and back to the very personal space. The way that gives you a lot of things. flexibility and control over that ability in your daily life. So I'm going to first describe the tool and then I will explain more about the underlying science and the underlying mechanism. Here's how you would do this. You first see is you would close your eyes and you would focus as much of your attention, including your visual attention on your inner landscape, on your interrospection. Breathing, heart rate, maybe even the surface of your skin. But really focused. focusing in turn. And you would do that for a duration of approximately three slow breaths. Then you would open your eyes and you would focus your visual attention on some area of the surface of your body. So for me the way that I typically do this fooder, focus on, say, the palm of my hand. So I'll focus my visual attention on palm of hand. And I then do three breaths again, focusing on my internal state. But now I'm splitting out a little bit of my attention. Terrosception. Extra reception. Okay. about something outside the ratio with the split of attention is about 90-10, about 90% of my attention is focused differently, but I'm also focusing on attention, extra. Most people can do this pretty easily. Then there's a third what I call station, and now move my visual attention outside my body, some location, move more of my mouth side and the extra environment, something in the range of five to fifteen. And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention to that fact. external off as I breathe I'm paying attention to those three breaths so that's why there's still 10% That's focused on my internal landscape because I want to pay attention to those three breaths But I'm focusing as much of my attention as outside of myself Just a little bit on my internal state so I measured cadence Then I moved my visual attention to get another stage It's further away typically I'll for rise or something as far off as I can possibly see again for the duration read breaths N And at that point, I'm trying my very best to move 99 if not 100% of my attention to that external location. And then what I typically will do is I will try and expand both my vision and my cognition to a much broader sphere. This is that Magnus seller vision we're talking about before. Where I'm not focusing on a particular location in the horizon, I'm trying to dilate the aperture of my field of view, so I can see as much of the visual landscape on this as possible. again for the duration of food rest. Then I would return immediately to my internal landscape. I would close my eyes and I would do three more breaths focus entirely on my interception, on my internal lens, what we call, or my periperous space. And I would work through into those stations making two or three times. The entire thing takes about 90 seconds to three minutes, depending on how many breaths you do, what is all of this do? Why do I call this space time? And why is this useful focus? setting. The reason I call it space time bridging is that the visual system is not just about the space, it's actually how batch time is how we carve up time. And the simple way to state this is that when we focus our visual attention on a very narrow point that's close to our body and our media experience, we tend to slice up time very fun. We're focused on our brief focused on our partners. In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape of our heartbeat. come to sort of second tier. If you will, on our experience, we're carving up time 40 to our, yeah, it's a module. We're as focused our visual attention outside our body. Not only do we engage that extra-septive, extra-personal space system, starting to engage the dopamine system, world-directed system. But we also start batching trying different. When we focus our visual system to a broader sphere of space or into space on the codelines of our skin. start carving up time, our frame rate changes. Now, this is useful in the context of goal setting. goal assessment, goal person, because with the exception of a very few isolated examples, almost all goals involve setting some goal that's often the future. And then carving up the time between now and being cheated of that goal into miles, range, in duration, and the rewards, even if we try and just make. every week are going to come at some unexpected situations. And that's actually helpful, reinforced, intermittent reward that's intermittent and random, it's the most effective rewards country we know. But the problem is always how do we keep our cognition in line with a long-term goal while also being focused on this part? This behavior for this practice router is teaching us to use our visual system and thereby our cognitive system and thereby our reward systems. to orient different locations in space and therefore different locations. And that is the essence of goal-directed me. That is the essence of setting a goal. It's about thinking about what you want. Then it's about setting milestones that are intermediate to that. Then it's about assessing whether or not you're reaching those moments. And then it's of course about updating your goals if you need to update your goals. All of that is an enormously confusing, that's your challenge. if you think about it all once. But if you break it down into these elements that the visuals can help you find a new towards this milestone that you can't love. What's very clear is that inability to move from different visual stations to do that. Liberate way, focused, conscious way, clearly maps to ability to see their different goals on different periods of time. And I do believe it can be greatly beneficial in allowing one to set particular goals, bullsh... through the milestones, those goals, to cause update what's pursuit and reward each of those milestones, eventually, hopeful. Per usual, over to a lot of material today we talked about neuroscience, psychology, popular understanding, goals seeking behavior, sesh goals, et cetera. But, use the visual system, better achieve goals, and indeed, things  visualization, life, forecasts, failure, or effective forecasts, success. And in addition, I disagree. this practice that we want to incorporate. Daily or semi-daley practice, so called space time bridge, using the visual system, your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your bodies, or peri personal, and sure it's at the space out into the world further and back again in sequence, as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision space time, word systems, so forth. Ultimately, As you set out to accomplish your goals, there are going to be a number of these steps that everyone will have to follow and have to clearly identify with the long arching. Ultimate goal is not to identify what the milestones will be. You might not know all of them, but you have to have some idea about the intervals at which you are going to set those milestones and set your rewards schedule or assessing progress to those milestones. My hope is that you will be able to incorporate these tools. all of them perhaps just one of them, two of them, in pursuit of whatever two of goals and that's not the same in the future. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your time."
