  "text": "I'm Julia Callie, retired FBI agent and pro-filer and former special agent forensic scientist the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. This podcast is about criminal profanity. This is certainly an unusual case. I've never seen it. anything. Quite  this one. With many serial killers, it's the killing part that they enjoy. And once they kill the person, they're done. Not Mark Twixie. Action. Mark Twixie was inspiring filmmaker. I interviewed him for my book and he corresponded for a number of years. He wrote me probably 30 or 35 different letters up to 350 pages of letters. One letter a Mark Hurtiel wrote back to me and this is what he said. The fact is society in general has a deep or found fascination with the dark side of human nature. I do think Mark Hurtiel was using the film making as an outlet, so live out his fantasies, and it ultimately wasn't enough for him. That's why. his fantasies, crossed into reality. I think Mark Twitchle believes that he is very smart, very methodical, very logical, very level-headed, much  the character of Dexter Morgan. And so I think he got ideas from the show. I think he was drawn to the character because that's what he wanted to be. There's significant lengths to Dexter. He had a healer. set up with plastic sheeting, he had a table set up for his victims, he had this kind of processing kit that was very similar to which the texture uses. Never once did a cross as mine ever because they aren't going to catch me, I'm too smart. Nothing's going to lead him to me. Right job is to put together the pieces of the puzzle in. In this case we had a written document. There was this document titled SK Confessions. Found in. deleted form on Mark Church's laptop and it appeared to read  a diary. This is the story of my progression into becoming a serial code and it documented blurring people off the internet. His first victim was a man named Jill Tetro. I saw this lady, she had blonde hair, she was very attracted looking and what was on him? She knew her. She knew. Yeah, I knew. She messaged me back. How about we go to dinner and a movie? I thought I was a great idea. Swink into the house number, but she just sent me really, really good directions on how to get there. He thought, , what's the worst of the half of it? Lets go further toi again. There is no key. No root pot. If I really were capable of inventing murder normal health and well adjust the period Old man. I once heard the lead into another word who said wonderful young children great Food I dealt with his remains in a disrespectful manner the traumatized me forever from the second half Serial killer must be passion quickly grew to resent and hate this man These are the words of Mark Twitchle Ritties will offer Steve Milbue. It is what it is and I am a man For the first time on television The level of you is revealing the contents of Switchless letters. It's a rare look inside the mind of a killer. Nobody would sigh with Dexter Morgan if we went around slaughtering school teachers and male carriers and a whim. The police in Switcho was fascinated by the fictional character and hit Showtime series. Dexter, I need to kill him. Switcho has been dubbed the Dexter Killer because of the... ...NewMur. links between television series and the real life crash. So how did this young Canadian film maker end up accused of her rific house story begins in October 2008? Take here how everything happened. It was  you watching the movies. Edmonton police detective. The person saying Bill Clark. But now we have it happening in real life. Bill's tattoo is online on the25th.com that side. This is a dating side. Text, who was 33 at the time, was excited to meet the woman who called herself Shea. I was actually late, so I was driving quite fast to get there. She said, well, this leads a garage to open for you. And then you just go in and go through the garage. I don't think he's ever imagined. , , there's what would happen to him in that garage. It was dark. Then I kind of looked around, so the door came to me to go through. And that's when somebody came out and attacked me from behind. Finally look back. That's when I see this man with this painted up hockey man. That's just a chill got my back. Wow, this is no date. It's  six blip and heapses. Black and gold hockey mass all painted up on this face. The hockey mass growing man. I had ordered him to the ground at Gunpla and to our piece of tape and covered my eyes with it I started Hearing different things  a genuine noise and stuff  that In my head is just racing, it is  thinking what's going on I see a reason taking another weapon out Jill decide he wasn't waiting to find out. I can't do this. I got to fight back So I got up and ripped the tape off my eyes you stunned and I got up I started yelling at me to get back down on the ground. Instead he grabbed the attacker's gun. When I grabbed the gun, I felt the gun was plastic. This is a great feeling I ever felt my life because then I knew I had a fighting chase again away. That's when I was ready to fight. I punched him and I felt really weak and wow, why would my eyes so weak? What Jill didn't realize was that he had been weaker and by the effects of the stone I'm serious. and then he starts punching you on the side of the head. Just about then you came up with a plan. Grab my jacket. A jerk floor to make sure you had a good hold on. I thought it was perfect time. I was probably a plan. You're thinking, okay, he grabs my jacket and I can get through. So that's when I slipped out of the jacket. Rolled underneath the garage door and then got up. And it worked. And I tried to run and also on my legs. My legs weren't working. I just fell. I'm going to go down the ground and grab my legs. I started pulling me back to the grove, something , oh no, why am I going to do now? It. Geo was thrown back in the grove. He was surprised himself by rolling out again. This geo managed to get into his truck. That's a peculiar mention, and then I just said it. EWغ! To go down probably. I think that should be said at the second level to get a network He discovered the profile on the dating site had been delete and he did his sister to erase his own memory. Why didn't you go to the police immediately? At first, as a shock, I said, at home, I saw a bit more, and tomorrow came and I was up, and felt so ashamed that I got dut. Embarrassed and confused, Giel convinced himself that perhaps it wasn't as serious as the racer's choice. really thought of a mugging at the time. But just one week later, another Johnny Alt, would answer a similar dating path. And disappear. Where is he? What's going on? He wouldn't do this task. Gary Alt Johnny's older brother says the last time anyone heard was on October 10, 2008. When the 38, Black Forest Day with a one name. And Jen, not a message, nothing. And then not showing up for work. Totally, I ought to have character. John, very, very, very responsible. And what did you grow from, when I received that email? And this email was completely out of character. What did it say? I've met a woman named Jen, and I'm going away with her to Costa Rica. And all you... Christmas going are just stopped right away after I read this. That's got to be the weirdest message I've ever received. That identical strange message had gone out to all of Johnny's friends as well. This was for some answers. Johnny's friends broke into his apartment. They found this passport and they found dirty dishes and they found everything just  as if he were going to return an hour or two later. And with that. information and then went to the police and he said, hey, listen, you gotta do something. Well, it was his red mask business. He had taken his vehicle and couldn't be found. So obviously that's what we're going to look for first. He's able to find a car than a person based on the emails and they talked about post-eureka, the officer searched all the parking lots, earpings. It's not found. Everything's turning up negative. But there was one clue that would give police their first big break in the case. On the day he disappeared, Johnny Altinger had forwarded the directions of where he was going friends. Well, Josh's friends were just friendly to the questions he wanted me to know. Be careful, and John said, yeah, well, here's the directions if anything happens to me, you'll know where to look. Armed with the directions, police were led directly to the ground. They were answering the graduate letter out and he was with me in my kitchen. 29 years old. I'm married man with a young door. I'd use the garage as a set for a recent movie project I'm glad I got the chance to work with you all and I hope you I see you all in the industry Mark denied knowing anything about a missing man or a red moth problem with a police want to search the garage They have a look around and they see some what looks  blood and market which was explain all That's my movie property I did a film about killing a guy here and I filmed it all and I'd be cleaning it up over the last couple weeks and there were some things that were, , raising your Spirits and Sons on there, this isn't right. So, go on. For detects and the Edmonton Police Department, the disappearance of Johnny Altimer was a mist in more ways than one. It's a misting person's case. We don't know if all police happened here, we don't have a body, we don't need no fear of a car. There only lead was Mark Twitchel's film, Sekarach. All in terror. The amateur film came down to the Edmonton Police Department to speak with detects. There's that name, or even help, but we didn't. Never heard of it, but Mark appeared to be eager to help. Yet no history of violence. And was hardly a suspect. Action. In fact, he seemed guilty of nothing more than wanting to brag about his film career. But I wouldn't  comedy right now, which is a infection of the world. The world's future is actually going to have a decent project. He won't prove it a lot. There you have it. Mark Twitch's first-film project, the Star Wars fanfare, had received some media buzz back in 2007. Where did you've gotten around that I'm making a $1,000 movie for six grand? And some production and director jobs already come my way. But the police were more interested in Mark's latest production. As a fan's thriller called House of Cars, we're a hockey mass serial. There's a man. to a garage via the end and Kelsen. So we just had a lot of the year coming back past thing. And we had an uproar and a man grabbed. We just had some of the missing person. Yeah, of course. That's pretty cute. And it seems  holding on to my own, I think this year's show. It looked pretty costable in the interview. And when it was done, I watched it. Well, that day in the vlog. Our slate marked Twitchll even agreed to let officers back into the garage. Feeling  moving forward And you're really well-balanced. So long, on how to walk back home... than to make it felt sewing time, with all that long. In a wide- experience I probably took a脑 out of fear of the car. Quite teenagers, for real. I'm actually gonna get burned. Calm down. Forget what, I'm pendulum shaking. Then I think he's so nervous. or he had filmed House of Cards. Little did they, in case was about to take an unusual turn. Detective Murphy goes, , in need some. I talked to him and there's this huge revelation about, oh yeah, I, I read Carl off of that. It's , I remember getting the phone call the police station just thinking, holy crap. That's because police were still looking for Johnny Altinger's Red Mazz. So investigators called Mark again. And yeah.. Again, he voluntarily agreed to answer more questions. This bill clock comes out at the end. So  why we're just here by applying Stion John John House here. Clark lists while Mark told him how he came into possession of a red car, a detail he failed to reach. When he spoke with police, Earth. He had a tattoo on my window and he was , buy a pot. I checked that with the bill. really rich lady, you can buy me a new car, so I'm just putting it on my bike, almost you have on you. Mark Cling, he bought the red moths for just $40, and that was parked at a friend's house. What are you thinking of when you hear about that? He purchased a car for $40. I just thought that's unbelievable. That's just right away I'm taking myself. This is a bunch of crap. The strange story about the red car. The serial killer. being so, for Clark the could only mean one pet, his ass will be no doubt in my mind, but you're involved in disappearance, John Olton. No doubt in my mind at all, my body. But it was only a hunch, Clark had no heart evidence against him. Police began digging deep into his back where they were interested in speaking with any who had worked on housework. Where actor Chris Huards, Karen, meets them on timely, runny end in the film. My character was killed with the samurai sword because they said they would have a manic and a dummy to run the sorcery. On a got there there was, I looked at the weapon, that was my first time when I saw that there was real. I thought, this is off. Why didn't I tell somebody where I am? Hu left the garage film set on harm, but rat and his unease only asks, when police ask him about that. allegedly fake movie, they spotted in the garage, how much of the blood splatter on the wall was from your thumb. So no, the blood splatter was from that. And then in a search of switch-holes belonging, police found his laptop. They pulled off of hard drive, a deleted file titled SK contestants. SK confessions, police believe SK was short for some killer. One of the first lines is said, right? when I decided on the serial player that I was a feeling of peer-to-flower. SK Confessions told the story of a man who was lured to a garage and stabbed him, a plot strikingly sub to half-sacrbs. I plunged the knife deep into his neck. It was unbelievable I just remember reading it all and just was fascinated by this document going holy macOS. But once the documents are screened or wasn't, mark twitching. Confession of Murr. It just doesn't exist. It is not this fire. Two weeks after the death of the dead. appearance of Johnny Alt and a garage films. Police had sharpened their focus on filmmaker Mark Twitchell, who least cameras were wrote as a forensic team process twitchals family caught in the garage he rent. And a few miles away the techheads have been at the twitch or home where they found just twitch marks on suspecting why of two years. What I said was we're investigating a missing person. I believe you're helping us. That's not what I do with. that was quite possibly, , could be a homo. I didn't really go into anything more, but I think that was enough. She was emotional. Police soon discovered that the Churchill marriage was all he fractured. They had been living it, basically sleeping in the sub. She would basically live in that main floor of the unit. So there was obviously couples and paradise there and we knew that. Churchill had been having an affair with an old girl. line to his wife about having a job. We found out that he was telling his life his normal work of the day had no job. He was getting his friends to invest in his alleged moviemaking business with his Hollywood connections and basically he worked with his wife living off their money. Interesting. The document police had found in TwitchLosLaptop titled SK Confessions, also refms a crumbling marriage and secrets. Get ready. And once we've great lengths to bring my wife. over to the comfortable belief. I wasn't cheating. It was basically a movie script. But what was real and what was fiction? The closer police, the more the lines learned. Police discovered, Twitch'll spend countless hours making elaborate how linguistics. It's almost  a timesmarked virtual isn't a fantasy world. But it was Twitch's Facebook page comparing himself to TV's thick. a traditional serial killer, Dexter Morne, that really re-esciended. Morne has way too much in comfort with Dexter Morne's red twitching stats. We've got a lot of hope for how we love the show Dexter. We need to kill him. Twitch will even pose as Dexter Morne on Facebook. We all have a dark side, some darker than others, and you're not the only one to relate to Dexter. It's sometimes scares me how much. relate and you look at this profile. That profile had caught the attention of a woman named René from Cleveland, Oh Han. I am a huge fan of this showtime show, Dexter. So I thought, oh well , I'll be friends with him. Eventually, Twitch will reveal his true identity. He was a filmmaker. We are rolling. And he was working on a new thing called House of Cards. Amazon rolling. It was in three. After all, she was an aspiring writer and a friendship with a movie that could open doors. I thought it was going to be  a working relationship, a working friendship. , we had a lot in common. But when you spoke to him a couple of times a day, a couple of times a day was a fortification. Oh yeah, absolutely. Their email exchanges soon became dark. It was shortly before Johnny Altimer disappeared. We talked about Serial Killers. and  the psychology behind the serial killer. At the time, Remain was upset with her ex-husbands you want. And I wanted her dad at the time, but I said I couldn't do it. And hypothetically how would you get away with it? Probably get away. He said, you cut her up in little pieces. You put her in trash bags,  dester. And since I was close to the lake, you ran a boat. And I don't grow out in the middle. you're angry. But then she began to wonder. He said, over the weekend he did something and he liked it. I crossed the line and I did something and I liked it. And what did you take about to me? But he killed somebody. What other line is there to cross? Something inside my head. Just gave me red flags and said, you did it. And her suspicions kept wrong with another email he sent. There's an enormous missing person, possible homicide investigation, going on centralized around a location had been renting for film worth. So of course the police have tossed my house and impounded my car. Not on considering they won't find anything. But Twitchell had underestimated the police. He thought he was way smarter than the police. One of the biggest mistakes I think that he made. was he had no idea how we do our job and that was a huge advantage to us. Adding to their circumstantial case, which will possess an Altina's own. The SK Confessions stock and his next obsession investigators finally had hard enemies. They found Altina's blood into which was trunk. When we got the word that the DNA match, we briefed our tactical team, our rest team, and had officers ready to make the rest. On Halloween, 2008, while Twitter was putting the finishing touches on his Halloween costume at his parents, at least were business-langtraffed. We got an undercover operator to work the internet and pretend he was going to end investor. He was lured out on the promise to be this guy at this coffee shop. And when he got about to be watching the house talk, he was looking at the phone and again cameras in prison. The talk is about enforcer 1 på 30 pubs. You're so scared and it is a little, , taste of zone that is seen in this. Back at the station, Detective Clark and Switch came face to face the meinturigation once again. As I told you that night I knew that you were involved in the disappearance that I'm a Johnny Altcher. That's changed slightly. I now know that you killed John Altcher. Three weeks after Altcher's disappearance. Hope. Police charged twitch with first degree murder. But once talking to a movie, barely uttered a law. No, no. Didn't get much of a word at, is it? No, he was not the same thing. God knows, as long as he's not been nipped in it. He didn't have to. SK Confessions, which police happened dissected, word by word, spoke volumes. They were now convinced it was no screen, but rap. Dive with merc, one passage about a knife, I thrust into his gut, his reaction, you're Hollywood. We do believe it's investigators at the account written by Mark Klobsher in that SK confession. Is exactly what he did to Donald. Right now, Renee had called us as authorities began building them. There was one crucial part of their relationship with most large people in London and that's their educated family, it's basically what Christ explained again that everything is going to happen. It's a very narrow look. throne will help in Polish their economicこと. I'm a veteran who had survived. It was just a huge piece of evidence because not only would it verify what was written in basket connections. It would also have a living witness so it was paramount that would find this person. Detective Bill Clark, new his next move was spawning the alleged victim who had escaped from Mark Twitch's garage. , one of the first things we did was check the police records, figuring, hopefully someone called the police on the has said, we have nothing. But police had found a helpful clip during the search of Twitch's house. One of the things they had found was a hockey mask. The escape possession stock about how Mark Twitch will have worn this. last when they attacked the elephant. But we figured it was something the first victim would kill. Police soon took to the airwaves. We have some details on this male victim with attack we would  him to come forward. Yield Techer was at home a beloved, Stuba Horror here this skate, when her friend told him to watch the news. To date we do not know what this victim is. I believe the victim entered the garage and was attacked by another male who was wearing a hockey mask. And it's the same hockey mask that I saw. This is the guy, what I'm doing is the same man, everything. What Jill heard Max came as an even greater song. Another man had been lowered to the same garage and met a gruesome man. We have not found John Altinger's body. And what were you thinking when you heard this? I couldn't believe it. When she found out the whole story, I knew at that point it was not just a muggy. It was actually used probably going to kill me. Bye! I had to go forward now, I had to come forward. Exactly one month after he was attacked, Jail Tetra walked into the Edmonton Police Department and told police his incredible story. That was all about the crew. I felt that I was from the grabble driveway and basically crawled in and dragged me back to the garage. Jail story matched nearly worked for work. What was in asking confessions? I grabbed him by the... way as if to drag him back into the garage caveman's style. So I know that this diary we have is true. After this all happened I realized I  here. Seven days after Jeal was attacked, we say Twitchell wasn't going to make the same the same place. How did he chill on Chon? We know that he wrote him to the garage in the same way he wrote Jeal's Tetril. And in this case because he learned from Jeals at the caveman. he had a mobile phone. Following the map, police, Altener, was then stabbed and dismembered on a makeshift autosite. What was the most damaged of evidence that she was told? We had a aluminum off-est on on the floor, large amounts of blood and been still gone before the garage. Probably one of the biggest pieces of the piece of tube that was found inside there. A piece of tube matched up to our victim. According to... SK Confession, the killer Vembroke, and the Altingers apart, and sent out those emails about taking an exact location. The killer then attempted to burn the room in a bar, but then he next took them into the room. But was afraid of being to see. Ultimately, Mark Kutcher wrote around with it, according to the SK Confession's document, he even talked about driving around with them and pulling up the side people at that lights and locking them and taking, they don't know I have a dead body. the trunk of my car. But where was Johnny Altinger's body? As K Confesh, he's described a killer, finally choosing a sewer to dump the remains. But that's where the pages stop. He was a store with apps and anything. In any homicide investigation, you obviously want to be in code to get found. So not only do you want to make that phone call, saying we got the guy that did this deal up one. But in this case, we wanted to say the work we found on. Detective Clark. twitch or would provide the final chat and it's a bit hard. You guys were driving around and there was a camera train going on him in the back of the bus. Yeah, well, tell me about that. When you reload your experts books about these types of individuals, they tend to  the media attention. So if you saw, well, maybe if you drive around and they put a camera on them, maybe he'll just take into place. If you had no idea where Johnny's remains were welcome. So in order to finish the movie, it's fine. body taking back to the people. Salmon, done. We'll be back in the night of all down. Detective Car was redentless taking twitch on a tour of his old neighbour. And we first built these parents house where he had been staying. We actually demand the details. We didn't. But for now your mark. Are we parked right on top of the sewer where you dump the money? Next stop. The scene of the crime. So here we are. I thought it could be killing garage, the dexter ground. Three back name memory? And the tell us where the body is now? Get the solar, but switch will remain silent. So police kept searching on their own, looking in sewer after sewer. So all these marable covers were pulled off in this alley. So anytime I see what I always had my flashlight with me and get out and actually take a lump. the lung. Then a year and a half after Johnny Oltinger disappeared, twitching while awaiting Trump broke his science and gave the police a map. Just up here on the left, it's about a block south of his parents' health. Investigators followed it to an alley just a half-luck away from where they had stopped the search. And he had marked an X, X marks the spot, took the freight to this sewer cover here. here, we could see what looked  pieces of human torso down there. In March of 2011, Mark Twitchell went on trial for the murder of Johnny Altam, Rossbier is called Geal Texture of the Testifying, and to prove that what Twitchell described in Esk confessions was not a work of fiction, but an account of what had. Actually, I was really afraid of him at that time, and he could hurt me even more. The only witness that defense was Mark Twitch, and he had one unbelievable tale to tell. Steve Loddy, a college professor, and an investigator journalist, was covering the trial for the Edmonton Journal. When on to write a book, the Devil Cinema. But that mortal testified that results in the understanding. and killed Johnny and himself defense. Twitch all claimed that Altinger's death was nothing more than a publicity stunt gone horribly wrong. He said he intended to let both men go so they would create a buzz for his stuff. By telling that this had actually happened to that, but he Altinger became in rage that means rare. And he accidentally killed himself defense. He blames Johnny saying that Johnny's reaction. to his attempt at this promotion is what happened. In the end, the jury took just five albums to find Mark Kuchel guilty. He was sentenced to 25 years to lie. But for Lillaby there were still so many questions. So the motive is the mystery, the why did he do this? What is Mark Kuchel's psyche? What led to this happening? Questions? Little if you want hooked. My P.A.S. when he got a call out of the blue. from Mark's witch and so. You just said straight out, if you're gonna be writing a book about me, you might as well come straight to the source. What do you think Mark puts his motive was? See the evidence presented at plot and more of 48 hours.com. The first time I met him, he actually had me laughing. Very charismatic. Mark Twitchel was nothing  author Steve Lillib, expect. It's very much that salesman's slick behavior. He knows how to put it on to get people to  him. Twitchel began writing to Lillib you in before he was even convicted in 2011. Over the course of almost re-ears, the exchange does the sluvelers. I learned really quickly to heap of food to talk through writing. He's won't rambling instead of a crazy man. He was actually some substance to me sludders. Yes, absolutely. So he's not crazy. He is, he is lucid. At first, Lellabewen didn't want to push ritual away with too many probing questions about his crimes. I asked him a lot of softball questions. Who he was, his family is upbringing all that kind of background detail. He was new to married and new father. He was just typical. local guy who had dreams of making it big and Hollywood and really no red flags no warning signs that something  this was on the horizon. In letters, Twitchell quang to his defense that he had no choice but to kill Johnny Altimer and pen this member. He writes, I kill Johnny Altimer in a horrific accident of self defense. After, personally shoving aside money. human sensibilities. I dealt with his remains in the disrespectful manner that traumatized me forever. He still is adamant. This was not a planned deliberate murder. And to be frank, he's he's law. Little bit of importance to SK Infessions. We're twitching the scribes how we turned that garage into a killer. Set up a makeshift box-opsy table had plastic sheath and a processing book similar to the one texture-more-key. Mark Tuchol awoke to me quite extensively about this interesting texture. That's for on this long. Tuchol drew this portrait of Michael C. Hall, the actor who plays. And to love you on surprise, even behind bars, Tuchol was able to feed the subsets. Previously on Beck, Mark Tuchol get actually been granted access to finish watching the series while he was incarcerated. in 2012. Thefter Star, Michael Seahall, was asked about Mark Twitch on a Canadian radio. It's horrifying to entertain the notion that something you did inspired there. Twitch's response to Hall's comments was to downplay his fascination with the Dexter character. So he brought him as your away Dexter has almost nothing to do with my kids. Throughout their correspondence, none of you can attend to grapple with what's row, twitchrow. And then twitch, talk. There is no key, no root cause. There's no school bully or impressional gory movies for showtime television series to point the finger at. It is what it is, an amaran. He's a depraved individual, and he knows that. It tired FBI criminal, provider. How? Didn't work on her skills, but she spoke with the tech of Park and reviewed more twitchals writings and letters for 48 hours. She thinks she knows what made twitchal 10. I think I identified with Dexter to some degree. I think it's different than Dexter. He's not killing bad guys. He's killing very innocent good people living productive lives. And while he's technically not a serial killer, he was headed in that direction if he hadn't caught him. Time. Cali believes Twitchel took pleasure in class and executing his crimes as if they were remanded trists. I think the primary motivation is sexual. Sexual, yes. He's a part of the man that perhaps he would be interested in having a date. It's a combination of sexual motive and thrill killing. It's pretending to be a woman. It'd be great. extensively about what is going to wear, the weapon that he chooses, he sort of describes it in a subjective language. I wanted the weapon used for the deed itself to be simple, elegant and beautiful. And in a strange twist, Tuch has been able to feed Vada of Sush in 2017, he was allowed to join an online dating website for Inants, which , I find. quite surprising considering the way he ended up in prison. I believe it's been taken down since then. The man who was tricked into that very bad date in Twitchell's garage, geolptatial, from 10 years to be haunted by the experience. We caught up with him recently. I still think about the fair-up hockey mask, I still think about the stun gun, fight for my life. Mark Twitil can not be rehabilitated. This is who he is. Action. Enflim Mark Twitil, inspiring filmmaker. There may be one final thought twist. author Steve Lilip sold the rights to his book, Devil Sin, to a film company, which will store maybe come to the big screen. A song that's sweet, just by the other night. His parents' names , cars go off road, things happen. We're having to behold his economic headsets. It's taking weird and weird turns. Never he sounds good. Hopefully that was kont Tomatoes'plets continuous nest. City's."
