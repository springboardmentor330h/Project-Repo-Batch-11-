  "text": "I think everybody needs to listen to them. So if they want to start 20-26, probably. If they want to learn, that's really stable in my this year. It's from speaking to some of the wilds leading minds and knowledge of brain, which might just be the most powerful asset that we want. In a few listens to the diary we see, are you probably listening as you're trying to get something with this information, inspiration, meaning entertainment, all of which, because you're striving towards some kind of gut. And it's dawned on me this year because we've seen so many right on the other side, so that this all starts having a healthy brain. So... I thought, I feel in some relationships, I'm memory, I'm chance of having a future start in the brain. So in this special Christmas episode, we're going to focus on brain. How you can have the most fundamentally healthy brain so you can live the most fundamentally meaningful life. I've been through all the episodes where we've talked about the brain. And I've looked at the moments that you shared and replayed the most and the moments that added the most time into your life. And I've put all of them into this opportunity. Do you remember the first time you saw working in Bray? I do. Do you change how you think about your own Bray? It changed my life because I want to stay that. That is a coolest thing that I've ever seen in my whole life. It was life changing. I say that because the sudden conversation you said that most of us did appreciate our brain. Follow the people they can realize at that. Yeah. I had a brain scan one day and that brain scan really changed my life. I was seeing my own brain first time. It was the push that I needed to start caring about how my decision behavior is impacting it. So let's talk about how I can make that ball of tofu and I had soup out there. Yeah. Big fun fluffy. You talked about exercise early on, but we didn't really dig into exactly what you mean by exercise because exercise energy almost lasted in the middle of it. Kind of exercise should I be doing to make... my all of tofu in my head. Great. Yeah, I hope to all. Well, all the research shows that the best kind of exercise that you can do is anything that gives you a aerobic activity that is getting your heart rate up. So that goes for, , power walkie. We'll get your heart rate up soccer. So many different things. Name your activity. So many people want to say, oh, my full productive will that work? And I always just say, is it, is you all? Time to level up, go check out. One second falls into that So you'll have to get some stones and whatever action you're gonna get alright. right up when you're doing it, if the answer is yes and yes, that works great. We know that that level of aerobic activity is critical because that's going to release that growth factor maximally to get into your hippocampus that will go through some new things else, how much. So, I have an answer to that. So, we did two different experiments in my lab. One in low-fit people, that are really not exercising very much at all, less than 30 minutes. in the last three weeks you've moved your body. And we asked, what could we see any behavioral improvement in your memory function for me? If a campus or your ability to shift and focus attention, if we asked you to move your body in a aerobic way for two to three times a week, and we collaborated with a spin class, a clearly very aerobic. And what we found was in those people that did successfully. do two to three times a week, a 45 minute aerobic activity, their mood got significantly better. Their memory function got better and their ability to shift and focus attention got significantly better. So that gives a little bit of a guideline for low fit people, two to three times a week can start to giving some of those cognitive changes. But you don't look low fit. So let me answer the question you're about to ask me, what about me? exercise pretty regularly and how much do I need. So to answer that question, we went to another spin studio and we said, look, we're going to give you three classes. You could exercise as much as you want in this at this studio and go to seven times a week. And the control was just data set. , they were working out twice a week at the studio. Control was the other group, but when you have some good things, they got it. And so we're... we found was basically every drop of sweat counted. The more you exercise, the more change in your brain you noted, both your hippocampal function, the hippocampal function, and move. You were already getting benefit. You're already going twice a week. But the more you did, the more brain changes you got. So that doesn't give the formula that I would , but we were heading in that direction, which is part of my mind. questions that I want to answer. But I love to be people with the idea that every drop of sweat counts for building your brain into the big, that fluffy brain that you really want. And then in the real world, again making your super real football. Yeah, how does that change how I show up? Yeah, if you allow it to show you, should have a beautiful effect on your mindset. That your mindset around up. How often should I take wake up a 30 minutes early and do that walk before I start my day or accept the invitation go walk the dog with a neighbor. It's not an obligation. It is something that you do for yourself. It is going to have direct benefits on that ball of tofu as you call it in your head. It's going to make it work better. I think the most media thing that I... benefit from every single day is the mood boost you get from that serotonin dopamine or granola and the get-for-least every kind of mood. I always think that because I also do a little podcasting and it's super rely on my brain things attached to my mouth sometimes I'm gonna just let us know. Yeah maybe I  to hunt them or take a look or get my gloves together whatever. Yes. I always I've tried to figure out the correlation between what I did that day when I have good day versus bad day. Yeah and I've from from you and also I speak patience sometimes I Wolf of Julius. because this will turn you up and speak a one day on a trampoline before it gives up on stage. I'll ask myself, should I be doing a workout in my dream on workout on staying with a big pool presentation? I think I should say. Oh yeah, absolutely. What's the basis of endurance? It's the basis is that immediate fact, so there's three key effects that we know happen every time you move your body. First one is move. You're going to get your dopamine, your serotonin up. Second is focus and attention. So a single workout isn't going to make more synapses in your P-Fumple cortex, but the P-Fumple cortex uses dopamine. And so it's clear that even a single workout can make your P-Fumple cortex work better in terms of focus. It's tension, also very important anytime you're speaking. And the third is reaction time. Your reaction time is, , motor, your, your working your motor cortex when you move your body. And your response and reaction time is significantly short. after even a single workout compared to if you just don't workout and sit sit alone. So great great things to do or great thing to do before you use them. What about coffee? I'm trying to figure out coffee. It's good for my brain, but for my brain I got a couple of mixed lists around the impact right now that  caffeine is a stimulant and alright. People respond to that kind of stimulant in different ways. Over simulation with caffeine is not good for your ability to put words together. , this is where I turn to a main theme in my book, I'll be going to have your life with this, which is self-experimentation. For you, how what I think I treat, your coffee, to see what level of coffee is best, or whatever your podcast is giving a talk. The other thing that can work similarly to coffee that I've started and that I do every morning is hot cold contrast showers because that whole that you shower on yourself after the heat stimulates adrenaline in you a natural adrenaline it wakes you up and ok it was painful the first kind of few times I tried it but then you get addicted to it and I have forgotten to do it and got back in the shower just to doubt myself with cold water because I feel better when I do that or for first thing in the morning. So lots of different things that one can explore with. Okay, let me have this side of the coin then. What are some of the central behaviors that people get up to story that right? Well, sedentary behavior is one of them not giving a sleep is critical. We haven't talked about sleep. sleep is so important for normal functioning of the brain. I  to steer my students by saying that in torture situations, if you deprive a person of sleep for too long, they literally die. They got you cannot function if you are deprive of sleep for too many hours in a row. It's that critical. We happily watch too much Netflix at night and get only five hours of sleep. When we could have had eight. So what's happening exactly why is it so important? Well, there's so many different things. I'm going to say too. One is that we know that in regular healthy sleep, there is activity in the hippocampus that helps you strengthen the memory that you have formed in that previous day called consolidation. And it's so important. If you shorten that, you don't get enough. You're not consolidating your normal everyday. memories and second it is the time during sleep when all the metabolites all that garbage that your brain is producing because all biological cells produce garbage it get kind of cleaned up through the cerebral spinal fluid that is flowing through your brain and if you do not get enough sleep you build up garbage metabolites in your brain it's  you have a good brain and do you feel  I feel  I have dust in my brain when I don't sleep enough that is exactly what is happening. What were you think about things that we can see? food and drink alcohol or these kinds of things. Is there anything that's on trying to have an optimal brain? I should be having an eye. Yeah, well, so I think the most evidence is around the benefit of the Mediterranean diet, which is basically all healthy to be kind of organic, but no. process is the way I was trying to think of things to eat that are very, very colorful. There's so much evidence about how good that is generally for the brain, that is my go to. What should I eat? Well, is it on the Mediterranean diet? If it is, then go ahead. If it's too processed, I'll do it. It's over there. It is a true bed. We have less friends. We have less strong relationships. We're lonely. Then I'll bring the strength. and is more prone to dementia and Alzheimer's and the liver. Yes, we are social creatures and there are really powerful studies that have shown the correlation between the number of social connections that we have including just saying hello to the barista at Starbucks. It's not a close friendship that you develop over 30 years. It's just how many people you interact with and greet and longevity. The more people you're regularly interacting with the longer you are living. Overall longevity, but if you go into brain health, absolutely, it's also very, very healthy for you. It also brings happiness. So, friend and colleague of mine, Robert Wallinger, studying what makes people happy. The study started in the 20s, 1920s, in Harvard. And after all of those many, many, many decades, the answer is what brings happiness. Happiness is a strength of your social connections. So it needs to happier and it needs to live longer. And yes, loneliness on the foot side causes stress, long comes stress that damage the brain. And yeah, in the long term, can make it smaller. And let's help. Here's the big question. When I asked you before this conversation starts rolling, what you're really excited about the moment your response to me was, if you think it's one of them, which let's help. your face was crazy. Yes, and it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because the writing has been around for a decade and it's always been in my mind it was one of those Jim Broding. I don't need to be a swallower. I don't need creating this get swallowing. This was the thought for many many years. Then over the last five years and I give this question and if I couldn't. of creating on the brain. It starts to really get my anything that affects the brain. I really pump and just sit in. And so that's kind of what did get me the most excited about about creating. But also I started doing a lot of resistance training. And so I was , okay, here I am now. I'm  one of those gent guys. I'm doing, I'm doing the barbells, I'm doing the squats and the dead lives and all that. And so why not give myself some, but what is great, right? Rising for. You talked about earlier, , why does our bodies make more of these things that are so beneficial? We do make crit. We make about, I don't know, our liver makes about 1-3 grams a day of creatine and our brain also knows the true organ that needs it. Creatine gets consumed by other tissues  the muscles probably the one that's the one that's been used for, because creatine is stored as a spoff of creatine but it's used to make. So it can increase muscle mass, it can increase muscle strength, in combination with resistance training. Because you're able to regenerate and make energy faster. So for example, I became interested in it after reading studies where people that supplemented with creatine that were engaged in resistance training were able to gain more lean body mass, they were able to gain more strength. It was increasing their training block. So you can do one. to more reps, whatever exercise you're doing. And it seems to decrease the recovery time between those sets as well. So you're able to increase your training volume. Well, anything that's going to increase your training volume is going to then have the downstream effect of increasing adaptations  these muscle mass or muscle strength. I started celebrating the creatine about a year ago, and I started solving a thing with it for that reason, my sweat and it. You So I was doing about five grams a day because that was really what was shown to be beneficial for muscle, how in combination with this extreme. And it's important for people to realize that supplementing with creatine by itself without any type of resistance training isn't going to grow your muscle. It's not going to be too strong. You have to put in the effort because what creatine is doing, it's helping you make the energy quicker, right? And then being able to make the energy quicker means that you're able to then. do that exercise better, harder, more of it. So it's super charging your exercise routine. I'd already been aware of the effects on the brain. I thought maybe the five grams today would do that. So what are the effects on the brain? Well, your brain also seems to lose a lot of energy. So it doesn't make it some creativity. But it turns out if you can give your brain more of that creatine, particularly under a Chishol精etologist... period of anything that's called these stress. So let's say lots or let's say emotional, psychological stress or in my case high cognitive load where you're just every day learning concepts, complex things, you're trying to remember them, you're putting ideas together and coming up with new hypotheses and you're just studying a lot. It's very cognitive. demanding that it's a type of stress on your blood that's coming  great. Under this condition of stress, the pressure is another one that's stress on your brain or neurodegenerative disease that's a strength of your brain. Any kind of stressful condition, that's where creating shines in the brain. I would argue that all of us who who has the perfect amount of sleep never has stress, nobody, right? There's always a sort of stress in the background. So, , that's... When I was , okay, so if you're the perfect person, , stress, the perfect medicine, gravity, your brain makes enough creatine to kind of do it. I know that I'm constantly interested in it, so I'm , okay, well, I can get any boost. And this is where a lot of very interesting settings come out of many different labs, some out of Germany that look at the dose of creatine, and how it increases creatine levels in the brain. And this is why I now. supplemented 10 grams a day. So the study out of Germany found that 5 grams a day of creatine with your supplementing with 5 grams a day, your muscles are greedily consuming, particularly through working out . They want it, they want it. After about 5 grams a day, especially over a few months,  you're saturating your muscle and that's enough, right? Anything above that kind of spills over to the right. And so what this German study found was that 10 grams of creatine increased creatine hiking mode and several different regions of the brain. That was probably the most exciting, I would say evidence that supplementing higher than five grams today is actually doing something in terms of getting creation of the brain. There have now been a variety of studies that have looked at different outcomes, right? So if you supplement with 10 grams of creatine or even go higher than now, 20 grams of creatine, how does that affect quantum function, right? And so somebody's studies have been done by a doctor in Canada. He's at the University. for Gena and Canada and it's looked at things  state deprivation. And it's been found that if you take some on and you click the five down for point one out and give them about 25 to 30 grams of creatinine. It completely negates the cognitive deficits of state deprivation. Actually, not only does it negate the cognitive deficits of state deprivation, it makes people function better. Then if they were well-rested. That's where I was Wait a minute. There's many times when I'm traveling. I'm jet-larg Lots of time-blum, see if you're five and I have to be in a podcast or a presentation whatever and In those situations I go up for my 10 grams to 20 grams  today reason. I wasn't really steeped to pride, but , there's a lot of high-convenged demand this long podcast So all that stuff and so I went up 20 grams today. Great. And I will say even at the 10 grams for me we were talking about this with respect to being in ketosis. I don't feel that mid-after new path when I have a great knockdown on a genetic diet, knockdown process. It's very clear for me. I've done this work sometimes I don't do five grams and then if I do that I'll notice why I'm tired right now. So there's something interesting and maybe a- I'm going to throw that out there very possible. But I don't know, maybe the creatine is, again, it's able to regenerate that energy quicker and so that's also beneficial for the brain. And now I would say all these creatine researchers, a lot of them are shifting to the brain. These to be all muscle movements. And now people are super interested in what creatine is doing to the brain, especially if you're supplementing with more of it. And this is important for people that are under a stressful situation. But... also for vegans because creatine is found in food mostly in animal products new and protein fish dairy a lot of these don't eat that and I've had so many of my vegan friends I've got them on the creatine and it's changed their why I mean they're  this is  incredible  can you imagine someone who's not getting any creatine from their diet they know me and all of a sudden they started supplementing with five 10-ren creatine and it's  they have energy some people said they require that's the key, which is kind of interesting. That's kind of a comment I've heard many times from people is that it's  the brain doesn't need as much sleep. They have one energy. So I've been a big fan of the creatine, not only for the muscle, especially because the human working now is something that's very important, but the brain is as well. I always thought of creatine as something that you took and have to load up on and then over a couple of weeks or months, the effects were taken. You're telling me that if I had creatine in mourning, that's the key. day I would experience potentially improved cognition if I have big of those. Yes, so, , great question. A lot of studies that have been done that you're referring to have been done in the context of exercise and muscular performance. And the reason why people have to load up on , they do a loading phase with a 20 grams and then they go down to the certain maintenance phase and five grams is because it takes, I don't know. I think it's about a month or so before you can saturate your muscular strength and then you're glaring. It means that the creatine which is actually stored in your muscles is also a creatine, is there and ready to be used to make energy. So it takes a month or so to do that unless you are really giving your muscles a high dose. So five grams a day, it only ignoids you it for so many days and then finally that's actually it. when you do this loading phase, you kind of just accelerate that whole process. And so that's why when people are doing these experiments, but they want to test the effects of creating, they want the participants to have really high level treatment in the muscle. But because they don't want to do a month off in the experiment, right? One of the experiments we were , so that was kind of the whole concept behind this loading phase. If you're not someone who's going to some kind of competition, , , you're a cross-fig game for something, you're not willing to do that loading phase. if you've already been supplementing the five grand today for the month. When it comes to the brain, what's happening if you get above that five grams, that's pretty much all consumed by the muscle. You're having some left over in circulation and the brain takes it up and it takes it up, right? It really shines under that stressful condition, which again, for me, I feel  every taste is cognitively demanding for me and constantly burning the material or... learning new information or working on things right and so there's a lot of cognitive stress frame. And so I feel  I'm constantly in the stress and that's where getting the creatine in your brain helps you make that energy quicker. And so that's why I've done I've had  been jet lagged and have to get a talk at 5 a.m. the morning might might by-law time after not getting sleep and I've done  25 grand creatine and it was insane how I should help again cause I'm anticipating how they what you slide to see those real things great and all about it. But there's some evidence also that this works, right, that the creatine is helping with under that superpurbation and that stressful condition. I was reading about study in 2025 where they gave creatine to people at the press of some to belong to side CVT training and people had creatine and their commissive able to air from training experienced greater improvement in their depressions and intons than those who just received their commissive. which is incredible. It's fascinating. I mean, depression is a type of brain stress, right? I mean, we know inflammation plays a role in depression, we know oxygen, stress plays a role in depression. And there have now been some animal studies that have shown creatine is somehow having more time plan for you, in fact. That has more been worked out. So I don't know if it's all just energy component of it. It could also be this other thing. the identified role that three teams playing in, having anti-inflammatory effect. And I don't know about that. I don't know that there's nothing to know about that, but I do know that it exists. And it's fascinating because again, I think we're creating really shons and brain in it's been shown study of study is under some kind of stress. Right, we're simple for each. Or there's a new study that can now it's published. I don't know a month ago or so. It was very small pilot stuff. and I was a caveat this. There was an old placebo control. But it did show that giving people with all pharmacists and these creatine, I believe it was 20 grand a day, did improve their cognitive. And so again this whole new field we're now looking at creatine from the brain, not just the Jim Broteboro, it was not just the muscular effects, but in the brain and how it's affecting the beneficial for cognition, for brain aging. For depression is the fall most weakly pain. One of the most inspiring I think liberating things that I've had in your work is this idea of near-apatheticity because if you're if the brain can physiologically change based on what I'm doing that It means that who I am now my identity that that 19 year old who's sleeping in the money thing with a fairer isn't who I always have to be I can literally change We spoke a little bit around  what caused the motivation to actually change but knowing that there's a My brain will actually change. Those two things are really inspiring because it means that whatever rock I'm stuck in isn't necessarily a permanent one. Now you said that the motivations change can be fear. Well in my case it took a fear circumstance, fear of becoming a permanent failure, to motivate immense change. That was that circumstance. I do believe however that the best to work, our most creative and best work comes from. love of love. But sometimes in order to find what you truly love, you have to be scared into setting off on a path. So neuropasticity is absolutely real. But if the question is, can a person change, can learn new things, can unlearn certain patterns, can overcome traumas? At any age, the answer is, absolutely. Categorically. Yes. How? Well, it's very clear that... as the child until about age 25 more or less. Just pass an experience, take great, for better or worse. After about age 25, and again, these are not strict cut-offs. We can change our brain, but what's required is a market shift in the neurochemical environment under which something happens. So one of the reasons why any traumatic event will forever be remembered, although, by the way, you can remove some of the emotional load of that. The trauma does not happen. the traumatic forever is because when we see or experience something very intense of a fearful nature, there is the release of certain what we call neuromodulant things  epinephrine adrenaline and other neuromodulators that cause a state shift in our body and brain. And the nervous system recognizes this as unusual and as a consequence in the subsequent days, there is reordering of connections. So that the brain. can prepare for that event should it happen again. This is why we have what's called one trial learning. You go to a certain location, something terrible happens there. You will forever associate that location with something terrible. But there are tools, therapy and other tools that can allow the emotional load to be removed from that so that you can go to that location and feel calm. No, please let's go ahead. The good news is you can also learn anything you want to learn. Provided there's a shift in this neurochemical environment. This is This is why when we are very interested in focused on something, to have the main requirements for neuroplasticity. We have to be alert and we have to be focused. We can't learn passively as adults. We can't just play a lecture about AI and large language models or neuroscience in the room and then it just then all it does is just sink in by osmosis. But if we pay attention and we're alert and we pay attention, there's a shift in the neurochemicals associated with that attention. called a cat colonis. It's three molecules, dopamine, epinephrine, and more epinephrine, all which causes increase in alertness, all which causes increase in focus, a Titanumovage field and an auditory field, so a clomes of attention. One way to think about it. And then it sets in motion a bunch of biological processes, such that we get adequate sleep that night. Maybe the next night as well. There's reordering a middle connection so that that knowledge that new experience is consolidated in your brain. you are forever changed as a consequence of that experience. So when we hear that the brain is constantly changing, everything that we encounter changes our brain, that's not true. Why would the brain change unless needed? Right, as a child, the brain is basically a template for changes. It's trying to understand the environment and make predictions. And so that's true. Neuropathicity is a cardinal future of childhood and adolescents and teens. Just think about the music you listen to when you're a teen, no matter me. is it will ever have as much significance. And that's because as a teen, your body is flooded with hormones and neuromodulators, but the amount of meaning that comes from now seemingly trivial events when you're a teenager or adolescent, is immense. That song meant so much and it's because the neurochemical mood creates a new, but as an adult, it takes a stronger stimulus. So the nervous system is very efficient in that way. It doesn't change unless it has to. Always changes. needs to, in order to save. This is why there's an asymmetric influence of fear as opposed to just interest in terms of what we're trying to do. But it's nice to know that love and excitement and appreciation are very strong stimulus for changing brain. From everything we know about neuroscience, it's clear that it doesn't matter if you're 90 years old, 70 years old, 50 years old, if you want to learn, you can learn. Not learning anymore. occurs through neuroplasticity, which is the reordering neuroconnection, strengthening of certain connections, weakening of others, and in some rare cases the addition of these neurons. But you absolutely can change your brain, but you have to pay attention to the thing you want to incorporate into your brain. You have to alert while you do that, and then absolutely have to go get some rest. This is during, so, during meditative states, and during rest, but we actually rewiring because the product has such a huge amount, I will probably describe the house, they gain change.

For those people who have just clicked to their lessons to come to station, can you tell them the mission you're on and why it's so important? And thanks so much for having this conversation with me. I think that little space to the problem,  someone has informed us you don't know anything you've never heard of tonight's club. It's important for us to make a distinction between  my class that people inhale and that, you played  some of the greats in card game to pass a button and card game to let us see nitrous, nitrous, these are two separate things. So very good point. So this is the nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is, I mean, a medicine is dental anesthetic. Right, it's a gas called laughing gas. It's into, in a different way. Well, we're talking about it's nitrit oxide. Or in a one nitripe, one ox. This molecule is foundational to even help them on. So, nitripe oxide is a gas. It's a naturally-consomalic acid. It's a lesson test at the end of the year. So it regulates things  bud flow and oxygen delivery, mobilizes and all stem cells, which can cover your repair, place dysfunctional cells that includes energy production inside the cell. And it regulates bud flow. So microcoxide is a gas produced in the end of the feed. It's the end of the family and the single layer of cells that lie, every bud that's the drug type. So the function of these end of the feed, it's to regulate faster tone. It's to regulate this. So when you're in the field of those, can along a make-and-and-the-coucces, they no longer die long, so the blood vessel would come, scripted, you start to get information, it's stiff arteries, pipe deposition, nestled starts, cardiovascular, breath expoosts. So let me get this straight, over a few back to what I can kind of stand about my chin, oxide, and you tell me the answer. So this nitric oxide is a... chemical that is in all the blood cells in my body and it allows my blood cells to basically expand open up so blood can flow through that. So if I dilate the smooth muscle, it was not affecting the growth. First say that it's dilating the smooth muscle with the strength of blood cells which have ways to re-watch we  to do. Fine so my blood cells can expand and more blood could go through that. but pronouns are precondent, undershaped. pleasure not wasting the我的. wouldn't expand, ultimately expand, period of relaxation for muscles. And therefore, I would have high blood pressure, which can lead to a series of downstream diseases consequences. And so when we look at the graph that I showed a second ago, where we're seeing, if anyone that can't see this graph in this pneumonia, we're seeing it. Nutri-coxide levels in young people up to roughly around 20,000 are optimal. And then, for about 30 to 70. There's this tremendous sort of 1890 drop in terms of chronic disease that is downstream losing nitrogen oxide. Can you give me a bit of a menu of chronic disease that is associated with this nitrogen oxide and the machine C? Yep. And we've touched on, so we've right out this question. So when erection's in both minimum or depend upon dilation of blood vessels to get Mountain oxide or anything more to get some concentration for thatargent. Then we call that the snarling. coma. Because for years people thought it was a lifestyle. Right? Well, it now I tried to make it a symptom of loss of a crack and blood cell. And really an accelerated form of cardiovascular blood pressure metabolic disease and diabetes. And then the other one is obviously Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is a vast herd of foods. And night cook outside corrects every single thing  about in a bruised blood powder the brain. In a bruised glucose cell. So it overcomes the metabolic aspect of all of them. It reduces information. I can remember my path from an empty beach. It inhibits the oxidative stress we see all of the ionizing substances. And it prevents the immune system. And when you do that, when you restore blood flow and get nutrients and oxygen, you take out the metabolic waste products, there's no mistleting of the coat. So you don't get the amolid glycogen, the calcium waste. So this simple molecule, microcarxide gas. absolutely can be useful about a case who also really is it addresses every physiological root cause if you can get it administer care physically to patients. Ali, no, I think that's a very key because the successor failure of any clinical trial, any drug and any clinical trial is depending upon the sign of the clinical trial. And what patients are what stage of disease you're involved? It's one of the inclusion criteria in what it's used. And there's a stage in every disease, whether it's part disease hitting disease or something, where you've reached a point of no return. There's really no medical therapy that's been reversed at the C, because the rest is state and so on. So think what we try to do is take take patients early in the process, or we call vast dimension of cognitive data, early Alzheimer. Because what I want to deal with demonstrate is two things. Number one, hint. we stopped the progression. Once it started, can we stop the progression? Then number two is we want to, in locations, far enough along to where we can show regression. So can you move, can you move any more? So that's a very specific and finite patient population. We can design a clinic study at the absolute worst. We want to stop the progression. At the absolute best, we want to show the weekly regressions. And that's the... of care that you understand the mechanism of the system. To extend the key to treat it, prevent it, and get reverse it, and you can choose. Well, I want to think about the real good thing, based in my trick, Oxygen production. What should I be in take? To increase my nitrogen oxide levels, to keep them at a healthy level. I think the same answer is for that too. It's not so much what we should be dealing with, we should not. So we'll cover this step. Remember when you have to avoid sugar and high glycemic in that sweet. Because sugar is a toxin poison and I think about what sugar is. So when we eat sugar or drink sugar beverages, right, whether it's sucrose, whether it's fruit toast, whether it's scientific to sponsor it, the end result inside the human is in the sea and increase in glucose. So, Lomation in bud sugar, bud glucose, yes. is diabetes. And now there's continuous glucose monitoring to get to everybody. So if you eat something, it causes an increase in the bloodstream. But glucose, then you should avoid. Because glucose is the name of the fly, it's glucose. Right, stick. And if we, if you have a soda and you spill it on your countertop, come back to next day. Let's go ahead and find the one. That sugar sticks to everything. Stick to the protein. And it lowers. that's why diabetics have a 10-time higher incidence part of text group all cause more doubt despite the development of your normal or triple drop that's why they have non-humane moves is no micro-puts despite the developing diabetics that not macro-generate, tank-neotides, all that can be traced back to a lack of micro-puts at production because the sugars stuck to the enzyme the sugar destroys the oral mic for violence, to completely change the economy and the bacteria, to completely shut down my perception. But I think, thanks for your question, what should we be? I think you've got to eat a balanced diet in moderate. Americans are overfitted, that are the reason to talk around it, seem it, a bit different from obesity. Good high-quality protein, good quality fats, and liberal no carbs. It's really that simple. Here's the second. Morning. Think about the hate you have it that are popular in trend days and I'm not either any that stand out to you is being taken into the brain or take me back right because I had a couple of complaints that I wanted to break me one of the best things that you can get moment is paddle which is kind of I think it's a pickle bowl here. It's for my brain back in my brain. It's so good for your brain. He calls. It's working. You are Sarah Bellum and I told you that you are sleeping and as you activate this, you can do that coordination exercise. They are not. You are correct. Does that mean that people are going to uncool me, but I'm sorry about the mission. Yes, I already have. And the more you do that, that are coordination, you become a. And that's why coordination exercises, kids, we talk about kids. is you want to do that. For a sports, but not sports where they're going to get a headache, right? And we have to smart, then we are. But when I was young, my mother, who's now named his first, was the ping pong chip. And the neighbor, and she was really good, and she never let us be her until we come. But she was always in college. I've got a lot of mental health. Different trends, my mental health rate. And one big trend at the moment, neuroploss training. Most people do games and these are other things  this. If you can get neuroploss training apps, you're going to have to work. Some of them, some of them work. And if you are so, for example, you're doing... memorization. Do them while you're on the bike. Now, not in the street, but if you're on a stationary bike. And you're doing those games. It's been found that exercise increases blood flow to hip camps, meaning you're more likely to remember and you're strengthening your brain in the process. So, exercise. with new one and stuff. If I want to learn something, I should do it while walking in the new game motion. But, so if you're listening to a line, you're going to walk, mindfulness and meditation, you're going to go back. Great. I published three studies on a combizing the other form of meditation called Cherokee Creatureiration. 12 Meaning Local Meritization administered, it's perfect, ADD, benefits. It's only twelve minutes. And for twelve minutes, you will start. So, two minutes out loud, two minutes whispered, four minutes out loud. So, two minutes whispered, two minutes out loud. So, time, time, time, time, time. But  that, people are working. But the one we stand, so, time, time. So, time, time. And so if they look at a curton activated or surveillance, activates your frontal lobes, comes down the motion. But people who did that well-mannered in weeks, they're resting frontal lobe function was strong. So simple. What happens with your frontal lobe? It's the focus, tension, pause. You do an appointment, and then you're saying, up, up, up, up. Up. Loving your talk. Good luck, everyone. How's it all going to be? Yeah. You're learning this. People who are in a job that does not require new learning of a higherism. Also, just, just. If you're stuck in your work. I'm not really risking. Yeah. And , if I just read Brains' Council, then I know how to come up with it. So I do that. But I also am writing about something I don't know about. Or I'm learning something. What if you work with the Office? I'm sorry. I love to go a bit of work with the Office. That chronic stress. increase the affordable. I think everybody should serve no their baseline cortisol level. And cortisol shrinks the hip campus and puts fat on your belt so that's too very bad for you. Breakfast work, practicing. Excellent. You want to break the parent's hand? The 157th class. Or so. Send hold it for a second and a half. 8 seconds out over person. You just do that for about five times the whole notes will come in. And the research shows a twice as long complete up as you breathe in. That's why four seconds in a second. It's a shifu nervous thing. Yes, they increase at something called complete. Make some Bag, social meaning! It's chronic physicians, it's the brain that. Gosh, because you're constantly comparing yourself, people who aren't people. What about alcoholism and alcoholism? So, I love my work. I've been addicted to it, but I love it. When they say people who work alcoholics, they're abnormally bright. See you... 體ные they're working with assholes, or doing something they don't. Or doing it for the money, both those other things. Microsoft, it's a problem. But one of the major causes of the problem is for the money. It's answer. I know there's more. Thank you for not keeping me up. Yeah, it has a chance. But, but... But a lot of times they take a mouth, micro pastics and other environments and folks and they think people can more wear their lounges. Noise, that and hurt the fact. And if it hurts your hearing, it's actually one of the rest of the health centers. Why is that? I think it was your not getting in. And if you're not getting appropriate input, your brain starts to. And if you don't hear what other people are saying and you have a lot of ants, never high-mixed to be biased, then you can actually begin to get a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit and fill in the emptiness of the emptiness. I just put some new apple apples and when I click them for my phone, I just put them to hear your hearing test. So I did the hearing test and then I offered up and she was hearing test book. and I was a little bit shocked. It said I hadn't lost me hearing you. Am I hearing this myth? The Lord is good at this house. And I'm in thinking, God, , this is, but I didn't have any idea that the house was real. So now I turned down the volume. But at first I'm in my life, because I think you're hearing the wind, God is really from duty, right? And the way, as you said earlier, starting from a better base, and you're taking back brain reserves is really big. game, engaging. My love question is a bit of a seem to be uncorrelated, but the world is heading towards wealth that's given by artificial intelligence. It's  all the overranging when you look on the internet . People are talking about it and I need their jobs, all you need to do is allow us to maximize the price, ways, when you think about the world to value our value. There are so many ways that I must explain to you for easier. as some of these doing scan frames is the one. But do you think hospitals have a significant digital background rates? I think in the short run it's going to be bad because you're brain is going to worse and that's bad for a poor person. I think it's fascinating to have an ultimate way of working in my brain. argue with reality, welcome to help. We need to figure out how easy to enhance our lives rather than to steal your home. But, not. Here's the first motive. It was said in 2007 that, kind of said, for human, that shows that human are pretty late and to oxidants, defenses, and down-regulates orxlative strat. There's a city that in 2016, which is a matter of analysis of random control trials from continuing to get variables by being proofed in terms of pain relief. There's a lot of work on here in the community. As I said, a lot of people get confused because they think, yeah, they do only works if you absorb it into the blood and they're saying they don't. What you do is you work with a microbiome to make it useful. And there's early pre-chemical studies. they can place around the impact it has with counts as, and there's constantly, but early study, showing the impact of cooking, that comes from tumor, it can have on brain health. So that's the focus is switching on to the blood supply to the brain, what we call the vesular effects, on the brain, and there's something we used to call the blood brain barrier, which probably we heard of, which is seen to be the place where, in the barrier, the stop, so a lot of stuff in the brain. potentially I'm sitting in. We now know that this blood brain barrier is a very dynamic, interesting interface between the brains to shoot and the rest of us, as now called the neurovascular unit NVU, and it is so exciting. And the more we look at it so far, the more we find the things that help the neurovascular unit blood brain barrier up past. And We have green tea and  we can see if we really want to help brain health regular drinking green tea It has been shown to be really useful not that rather than something by the way, so the drink that you have I'll buy but it's near Right so we can make it So as you make that you explain to me why green tea is a good idea Because it contains a number of, can polyphenols, and polyphenols are there. These colors are the case screen. And the memory screen is just the smoked and processed part of the tea leaf, that's a black or commune. So this is a nice Japanese tea pot, so I think it's happening to end. This is the marksman, be so. these are already with ginger and cinnamon.
