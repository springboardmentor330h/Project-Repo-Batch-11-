Inside Tracker analyzes your blood and DNA to give you an accurate assessment with health, myologically. There are many things about our health that can only be analyzed for blood and antibodies. I've been getting my blood assessed for many years now and about a year ago I switched to inside tracker. What I  about inside tracker is that get all this information back about metabolic factors and the current factors course. etc. that are really important to your health. But unlike a lot of blood tests, we just get all the numbers back and tell us whether or not. So, high normal and low inside tracker also has this really useful and really easy to use dashboard that takes the information for your blood tests. Once you're toward particular, behavioral, nutritional, and other sorts of protocols that you can use to get the numbers where you want. to try inside tracker, you can go to insidetracker.com. You burn them and they will give you 25% off any of their programs. Again, their programs allow you to assess your health from inside things that you could just never assess from. Any kind of test that didn't involve blood. And it also has this really interesting feature that it can measure your inner age, which is based on biology. Your chronological age of course is very informative about your health. There's lots of dangerous drugs. But people vary. We know people of course that are in there. 90s who are doing well, we know people. that are in their 50s who are struggling for even 20s. So blood and DNA are the way to realize your health. That's my belief that's why I use side tracker. So go to insidetracker.com slash human to get 25% off any of their products and use human and check that. Our second sponsor of today's episode is Helix. Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your needs for best nights possible. I switch to using a Helix mattress. this last year or better than I ever have. The way that Helix mattresses work is different is that they are tailored to your individual sleep style. Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website to brief two-minute questioner quiz ask questions  this. That side, your stomach, maybe you don't know, or maybe you move around a lot you're not. Also ask you questions such as you can run hot or wake up cold things of that soul. Then they... Taylor a particular mattress yours. Me, I'm actually a simple dust US, Tay mattress and love it. Sleep better than ever. Right now, you want to try Helix Sleep. Go to HelixSleep.com slash huberman. Do that. You get $200 off your order plus two-free pillows. They also have a great warrant. They have 10-year warranty on mattresses. Don't  the mattress for using. They pick it up for free for home. They just make the whole thing. really easy to try and determine how to swipe. So again, it's HelixSleep.com slash Huberman. You have $200 off, two free pillows. Some of you have asked how you can help support the podcast yet other ways besides just checking out our sponsors. You really appreciate the question, and you've set up a Patreon account at patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman, which allows you to donate to the podcast at a variety of levels. We have for instance. 5HTP, which is honor of serotonin. Serotonin? Then it allows you to donate $5 per month. We have circadian, which of course, is 24 hour a, so, 24 dollars a month. You , you can also pick any value that month. We even have the Costello, which is $10 a month, which allows you to support the podcast on Costello, in fact, is 10 years old, that he's 10 pounds of food. today and in fact that he takes 10 one hour and apps per day. Again that's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman likes to put podcasts there. Today's episode is all about science, oceans. First month of the podcast we talked about sleep and wake up. Last month we were talking about the role of plastic. Change response response. This month going to talk about about things that we call motions. Besides, what they are, how they work, how we control them, what might not want. There are going to be four episodes on motions. Today, we're going to talk particular about something that most often is called stress. You might wait, stress is motion, but stress really lies at the heart whether or not our... internal experience. It's matched well, or not, it's a little extra experience of events that have to us around us. And as you'll soon see, those converged will combine to create what we call options. Now, I want to be very clear that we're going to talk about biology of emotions, we're talking a little bit about psychological concepts related to emotion. Definitely going to talk about tools to control what we call. stress. Stress. Also going to clean up some common myths about stress, for instance, that stress pairs your immune system. That's certain context and other context stress actually enhances your immune system. It's a function better. There is going to be a lot of discussion about whether or not our internal state, whether or not you are alert or calm, is good or bad depending on the circumstances. Where we're headed here is a lie cuter company. away from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic framework for thinking about things that typically you just call half or sad, press anxious. And I'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded in physiology neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex space that will allow you to ground yourself better when you're feeling life is weighing on you were. hold by the current's life as well as just support other people, whether or not that's psychological practice, the sugar, or clients, children, spouses, really to be able to support other people in the environment better. And the tools that I'm going to focus on today, range from behavioral tools, we will talk about some of the more valuable supplementation tools that are out there. We're going to talk a little bit about things ... Pression PTSD, but we will be devoting entire episodes of this love depression. T.S. and even attention deficit and obsessive pulse of disorder which will be either or not. So, it's a surprise. You have a very strong emotional component. It's just not just about pulse of behaviors, truce of thoughts, it's also about emotional load of being in that state. So, I promise that today we're going to clean up a lot of misunderstanding with... going to give you a lot of tools and you're going to learn a lot about biology of how your body brain works together. Because if ever there was a topic that brought together brain and body, where mind body relationship, it's stress, it's also the positive emotions. When we feel something, whether it's unhappy, pleasant, or we are feel stressed and anxious over well, it isn't just an argument. and it's also gone. And as you may recall, the nervouss change, change, size, the spinal cord, but also all the connections. Organes of body includes the brain and body. And those organs of the body. Guy, liver, split. They are also communicating with the brain. So I look forward to a day and in fact, we no longer think about neuroscience as just brain. Many neuroscientists now also. body, of course, trolls the body, but the body is also having very profound concrete influence on brain. I think up until recently people would hear about your brain body and always think about mindfulness. We're actually not going to talk that much about mindfulness all today. Mindfulness is kind of a big concept. I think about mindfulness. What's the opposite of the mindfulness? Mindfulness? Well, all of a sudden we're into territory that isn't real. easy for one person to describe their experience way too. Help others with their experience. Today we're going to talk about objective tools that match brain bodies for separate brain bodies. It's the leverage your ability to lean into life better, to feel better, literally, to just feel better about what you're experiencing and we're not able to control your emotions. That's cool. This isn't about body. This isn't about trying not. to feel human, this is actually about leaning to light better as a consequence of being able to control some of the real estate services and how that nervous system can be found. That's the place you greater position of power. And so let's get started in deciphering what is stress, what are emotions, why did I that stress, the emotion, the emotion. So what is stress, you're all the time that stresses back? You're really stressed out. What is you all presumably heard the arguments or the framework that stresses this horrible ancient carryover from times in which humans were pursued by animals or other human predators and that whenever we feel what we call stress, feels stressed out that it's just this unfortunate invasion of something no longer eat on life. that this was designed for when you were being attacked by bears, tigers, lions, whatever it is, and gosh, what an unfortunate thing. And we have so many creature comforts nowadays, but we have not eliminated this stress. Almost as if it was  an organ or a system in our body that was bad for us, that were stuck with just because we are. First of all, all species experience stress. I think that it's fair to say, , I was there. that yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history, we were vulnerable to animal attack, another human attacks, on a regular basis, up until a point where we started developing. We have been structures, fire, and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better from those animals and daters, of various kinds, but it is entirely naive for us to think that ancient times, ancient times, it's term for. previous at medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago. Of course, there were, so that was, partners' chee. We'll die. In fact, before the advent of phones, talk about today, can imagine that someone might head off on a hunt, where to go visit a relative and never come back, he would never know why. That would be very stressful. So, there was psychosocial stress. There was stress. Using loved ones, there was the stress called a famine. There was the stress probably also just worry. This idea that ancient versions of humans, thousand years ago, 100 years ago, didn't worry. I think that's an entirely insistent with everything we know about the structure of the brain, 100 years and now it's years again. So all the problems that were struggling with existed for ever. It's just that stress at its core is a generalized system. Wasn't designed for Tiger. Tigers attack us with people attack us. It's a system to mobilize other systems in the brain of the body. That's what stress really is. It's designed to be true. That's the most important thing that I'd  to do. It's that the system that governs what we call stress is true in the brain. It wasn't designed for one thing. That gives it a certain advantage, taking over our state of our brain. But it also gives you all of us, an advantage, control. because it's based on hard-wired biological systems. And there are hard-wired biological mechanisms, cells, chemicals, pathways, tissues that exist in you right now, that require no-no-plastic that allow you to put a break on stress. It's going to talk about this. So you have a system of stress and you have a system of stress that are ached in you, genetically encodes, and we're born with them. still happen. So, you're alive and listening, you have the capacity to control your stress. Today, I'm going to talk about ways that you control your stress, not just by doing some offline practice and meditation and breath work or something. But real-time tools, tools that allow you to push back on stress with stress hits, real-time. , this is something that my lab works actively on, developing and testing these tools and evolving these tools, your other labatories that this is well. So let's talk about the stress response and by doing that you will understand exactly why the tools have to be work. For those of you that are saying, wait I just want the tools just give me a summary. Trust me if you understand mechanism you are going to do a far better position to cooperate these tools to teach these tools to others and to modify them as your life circumstances change. the cheat sheet or you just want the one page PDF eventually will get that stuff out to people. really important to understand the underlying mechanism. Okay, so what is stress? Well, let's just distinguish between stress orders, which are the things that stress us out, and stress, which is the psychological and physiological response to stress orders. I'm mainly going to talk about stress, which is your response. We are about what we already know, which is that stressors can be psychological, which is where they can be this. If I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket, for a very long time, that is stressful. If I have you compare for too many exams at once and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule and your other needs, comfort and well-being, well-tuned, rest sleep and social connection, that is stressful. So stress and, as I mentioned before, it's generic, doesn't distinguish between physical and emotional stress. So what happens when the stress is possible? Let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress response. You can also think of this as short term stress. So, have a collection of neurons. They have a name. It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia, and it has nothing to do with sympathy. Sympa means together, and there's a group of neurons that start right about it. You're neck. Run down to about your navel, a little bit lower, and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia. Don't need to memorize that. that name, the Roma vehicles, but it's important to know that in the middle of your body, you have a chain of neurons that went something stresses us out either in our mind or because something enters our environment, see something stresses us out. You don't  heights if you have great heights, somebody dislike, walks into the room, et cetera. That chain of neurons, activated by the bunch of dollars, all it wants is very fast. And that happened. those neurons release a neuromodulator or chemical that I've talked about before on this podcast called Cetacol. They release that at various sites with them. This is important. It's normally a Cetacol in which you use new muscles. Actually, every time we remove a muscle, pick up a cup of coffee right with a pen, walk down the street. It's spinal neurons connecting to muscle and releasing Cetacol. So, brain, it's in focus and it muscles, it's all making muscles twitch. But if we were stressed, we wouldn't want all our muscles to be attracted once. Just to be paralyzed with this. What the tonic acid vision is supposed to be. Wouldn't want that. It's called 10th. 10th is toxic cause that rigor above the entire body. Not one that. But those neurons are active. The Cdocolian is released, but there's some other neurons for the Faccinados out there. They're called the post-ganglionic neurons. Those ones responded that as Cdocolian. They release. the nephrine, which is equivalent to a granule. So we have this system, whereas very fast, whenever we're stressed, that core of our body, neurons down the middle of our body, release these chemicals, and then there's a granule epinephrine, released at particular organs, and acts, particular ways. Going down into the weeds here, so just stay with me. It's gonna make a lot of sense. You will appreciate having this knowledge. That epinephrine acts in two different ways. Some things  the muscles of your legs, heart, other things that need to be acted on your stress, they have a certain kind of receptor, which is called beta receptor, that beta receptor response to epinectrine. Blood vessels dilate bigger. Blood rushes into our legs. The heart rate is a lot of things happen. Activate. Same time. That epinectrine activates other receptor. on certain tissues that don't want to know about gesture, production, things that are that are blood shrooms, but when things are going well, not things to pay attention to them. Stress, and that binds to other receptors that attract blood shrooms. So basically the stress response, this is the key phrase here. The stress response is generic, so that before and B, it basically pushes certain systems to be active. other systems. So the stress response is too strong. It's a yes for certain things and it's a no you may not right now for them. So that's the key thing to understand it all the stress response. That's why your heart speeds up. That's why you'll blood certain organs that you should use in body but not in others. That's why your throat goes dry because it turns out that when you get stressed, the salary glands are shut down. There's a lot less blood flow to the neurons that you're sure will suffer. And so you're going to start swallowing, feel  your throat is getting off. There are a lot of different effects. I'm not going to list them all off, but basically you are activated in ways that support you moving. That's the third thing. First of all, it's generic, second of all, the stress response. Activate certain things, shuts down other features of our body. And then it's a sense of agitation that makes you want to move. And that's because fundamental, the stress response is just this generic thing that you're something. movement in this case can either be biased, e-transaction, or it can be the biased, say-sum. When we are stressed, we are more likely to say-sum. That probably we shouldn't say. We are more likely to move, and if you're trying to suppress movement, you'll feel that as a tremor. You're going to feel agitated, and that's because it was designed. So this is important because if you want to control stress, you need to learn how to work with. that agitation. I'd  to give you a tool at this point because I think if we go any further with a lot more science, people are going to get into wonder if this is just going to be a standard university lecture about the stress response. I mean, it gives you more science about the stress response, but I want to take what we now already know about the stress response. And use that as a framework for thinking about how one might reduce or even eliminate the stress technique. response quickly, real time, should it arise, we go once, so we're taking the podium, or we're sitting down at a zoom call, and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed. We're feeling  our heart is wasted. We're little too alert, we're feeling a little, worked up if we want to call down. As far as I am aware of, the best tools to do stress quickly, so called real time tools, are going to be tools that have a direct launch. to the so-called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is a name given to general features of alertness or confidence and body to completely implement a lot of medical that we do have some control over it, certain laborers and injury points. Here's what doesn't work to control stress. Telling yourself to calm down. In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else to calm down also helps us if you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress. response. The best thing you can do is activate the other system law, which is designed for calming relaxation. And that system is called the Perisynthetic Earth system. Because as I mentioned before, the drones at control stress run are not active. Perisynthetic drones, perigisynthetic gear exists in there. Some of the cranial nerve, so it's kind of black, neck and lower version stem, back to the brain and back and shutter. over here. Some pathetic nervous system is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves the ones that are up in the brain stem and bacteria, those have a direct block to various features of their face, particularly the eyes, the children's movements, people dilation, so that sort, as well as the tongue, facial muscles, etc. A person that it nervous system, many people don't realize this, is the system by which control the face, the eyes, to some extent, on airway, trachea, and it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic. Now the neurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of the genitals, the bladder, rectum, and those don't have a direct long. You don't have a direct way to control those. Actually, actually, you have to go brain to spinal cord in the pelvic organs. Whereas the person pathetic nervousness that has certain entry. points of what I'll call levers, that will allow you to push back on the stress response real time and diminish it and feel more relaxed really quick. So I'm going to teach you the first tool now, so I don't overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge without giving you something useful. And the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded physiology in neuroscience, but calming down a self-directed way is what's called the physiological system. song, as such, each. Some of you might have heard me talk about this on previous podcast, but I'm going to explain this in a context of how respiration in general is used to calm us down. In terms of that, you're all doing this all the time, but you are doing it involuntarily. And when you stress, you tend to forget that you can also accolade this whole term. This is an extremely powerful set of techniques that we know from scientific studies over my lab, Jack Feldman's lab at your seal. away and others now that are very, very useful for reducing your stress response and the real time. And here's how they work. These days there seems to be a lot of interest. Breathwork. Breathwork typically is when going to sit down and lie down, you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of minutes, according to Shiftier Physiology Access and States. It does have some utility that we're going to talk about. That is not what I'm talking about. When I refer to Physiology. size is the very real medical school textbook relationship between the brain, body, and body as it makes. Breathing out for rat-eye, diverting lungs, and heart. Let's take the whole mark of the stress response. The heart starts beating fast. Blood is shuttle to the big muscles of the body . Move you away from whatever it is. The stressor is just  you need to move much and there.\" heart rate, many of us feel is involuntary. Just kind of functions whether or not we're moving fast, moving slow. If you think about it, it's not really purely autonomic because you can speed up your heart rate by running. Slow it down by slow down by slip, run, to walk, walk, walk down. But that's indirect control. There is however a way that you can breathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interaction between the synthetic and the cypress. You're soft. works. When you inhale, so let us know for through the mouth, this skeletal muscle that's inside your body called givering moves down and that's because the lungs expand the givering down. Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger and that expanded space. It's more space for the heart, the evhution, the actual physical heart, the volume grows. And as a consequence, whatever blood is it. is now at a lower volume or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume, then it was in case more space-heart gets bigger, blood moves more slowly and there's a little group of neurons called the sinus atrial node in the heart that registers and it's not those neurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart. And send a signal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through heart. The brain then sends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up. So what this means is if you want your heart to be faster, inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your accents. There are a variety of ways that one can do that, but it doesn't matter if it knows or through the mouth, your inhales are longer than your exhales, your speeding up your heart. If your inhales are more vigorously even if your inhales are shorter than your accent, you are speeding up your heart. Opposite is also true. You want to slow your heart rate down. Stress response is, you want to slow your heart rate down. What you want to do is again capitalize on this relationship to body, the diaphragm, heart and brain. Here's how it works. When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, which makes the heart a little bit small. It gets more calm. Let's close more quickly through that compact space. So let's just tighten this ball. The SinoHryl node registers that blood is going quickly, sends us up to the brain and the parasim pathetic nervous systems. We're on to the brain step, send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart. So if you want to calm down quickly, you need to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous. The reason this is so attractive as a tool for control and stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve a practice that we have to go and sit there and do any separate performance. And we are going to get to emotion, emotions and stress happen, real time. So while it's wonderful to have a breath or practice or the opportunity to get a massage or a sauna, whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress controls in the right direction, having tools that you can reach to real time that requires no learning. And to teach a TV, you have to learn that, but it doesn't require any plasticity to act with your own staff. feel and stress still need to inhale of course, but you need to lengthen your excess. Now, there's a tool that capitalizes on this in a neat way, not the twist, which is the physiological side. Physiological side was discovered in the third use. It's now been explored at the neurobiological level, mechanistic, and far more detailed by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA, also Mark Krazos lab, Stanford, and the physiological side. is something humans and animals do anytime they are about to fall asleep. You also do it throughout sleep in time of time, with carbon dioxide, we'll talk about moment builds up too much in your system. And the physiological size is something that people naturally start doing when they're flying and they're trying to recover some air, we'll calm down, they're sobbing very hard or when they are in claustrophobic environments. However, the amazing thing about this thing called the iron, the skeletal muscle is that to be... internal organ that you can control voluntarily. Unlike the screen or cart, or your pancreas, where you can't just say, oh, I want to make my pancreas turn on a little more insulin right now. I'm just going to do that with my mind. Directly, you can't do that. Just do that by smelling your doughnut. But you can't just do it directly. You can move your diet for him. Intention. You can do it anytime you want, and it'll run in the background if you're not in the wrong spot. It's a credible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm. What's called the fr... your P-H-R-E-N-I-C-Fran, the Frennic, innervates the dive range, you can control any time you want, double up your inhales, triple up your inhales, exhale more than, thehales, whatever you want to do. It's an incredible organ. The physiological side is something that you spontaneously but you're feeling stressed, can do double inhale. Shhh! Shhh! Shhh! Long exhale. Now I just told you a minute ago. that inhale more than you exhale, you're gonna speed the heart rate up, which would promote more stress and you're shooting. Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale exhale in order to calm down. And the reason is the double inhale exhale, which is the physiological side. Takes advantage of the fact that when we do a double inhale, even if the second inhale is sneaking in just a tiny bit more air, it's kinda hard to get two teeth and heels back. So back to the big deep inhale, another one, and then the little sacks in your lungs, heavy oil of the lungs. As long as our tube bags speak the millions of little sacks throughout the lungs that actually make the surface area very good lungs. Biggest of the lungs. Biggest of the lungs. Biggest of the lungs. Just spread that out. Those tend to collapse as we get stressed. Carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream and that's one of the reasons to feel agitated as well. So it makes us very jitter. And there's some other effects of carbon dioxide in one getting too. But when you do the double inhale exhale, the double inhale re-inflates those Можетess air. the saxophones, and then when you do the long exhale, that long exhale is now much more effective at reading your body and bloodstream of dog side, which relaxes very quickly. My lab in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, David's associate with Sheriff's Hiperate Stanford, are doing his study right now, exploring how physiological size and other patterns of breathing, done deliberately, can modulate the stress response and other things  to push out those work are on. going, I want to clear those things from done, but it's very clear from working our labs, from working check-films lab, others that the physiological side is the fastest, hard-wired way for us to eliminate this stressful response in a lot of quickly real time. And so I'm excited to give you this to good, because I think most people have heard that mindfulness conditions go out exercise, good for us we all, sleep, etc. and when you find yourself in a position where you are more alert and activated that you would  to regardless of whether or not the stressor is relationship or it's financial or it's physical or anything  that you can look to the physiological side because it bypasses very important feature of how function which is that it's very hard to control the mind with the mind especially when we are heightened states of activation. We are very Realert were very sleepy, it is very hard to use the so-called top-down mechanisms of contention and gratitude, all these things that are really powerful tools when we are not super activated and stressed were not super tired. But when we are anywhere in the range of very alert and stressed, very sleepy, physiological size or a powerful way of bringing our level of so-called codenomic activation which is a level of alertness down. So whether or not it is in line at the back. or whether or not you're wearing a mask nowadays or you're not. Whatever the conditions may be, where you're at, and your needs, when you're feeling stressed, physiological side, done just one to three times. So double in heel x, double in the x-hill. So times, we'll bring down your level of stress, very, very fast. And as far as I know, it's the fastest way to accomplish that. An important note about physiological side or exhale the right side of your way. lowering the stress response. Many people worry that their heart rate does not come down fast. But I want to tell you do not want your heart rate to produce very fast. There's actually something called the phase-of-the-goose response where people stand up or they'll get up in the open 90s, and that's where they'll all set up and collapse the state. That's because the heart rate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or they'll see something really troubling and stressful and there will be no jam pass out. That's an over activation for an acceleration of the call response. They're not so stressed, they kind of fall off the cliff of stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism for common cells down goes too high too fast. They calm down too fast, collapse. And so be aware that if you're going to use the physiological side or excel in the size where you can calm down, that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds to come down to manage it. repeat the physiological side in terms. So that's an important note about the use of breathing to control levels of stress. The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body to control the mind, it does something else that's very powerful when you are stressed in your mind and body. So you'll really agitate actively, worry, and use a tool  physiological side or exhilarating. You will notice that then you're... Rain in your mind becomes more available for controlling the stress response. Yeah, it's just great because the sweet spot is right. Provided you're not trying to sleep as to people who are alert. So that's the idea is to alert and calm and bring you back to that plain of alertness. For those of you that have trouble sleeping for just relax and stay, Physiological Sikety repeated for 10, 15 cycles of your life. Some people find that they actually put them to sleep. So if they lie down and they're reading and they do too many of these, they're actually obviously. And what you'll find is that most breath work protocols kind of stuff is done away from your life instead of cytosy time, cytosy putt, breath work. Most of that works such that if you're doing in the nails that are longer and more vigorous than exhales, it tends to be activating and more of you. If you're doing exhales that are longer and more vigorous than the inhales, it tends to put your sleep and many of the protocols that are out there from laboratories and that of course. the Internet, wellness sites, whatnot, if it's Excel and Physi-Size breathing oftentimes that use as a tool for trying to teach people how to fall asleep. Physiological size is a little different. It's designed to use real time. Just think of it. It's just kind of in your kit of things that you can do as life happens and as you need to react to them. Note about nasal versus mouth. There's a plethora of information out there now. There's a juice. Nestor's book, Breath, your science of law start. You can now have this last year, ex. Book as well as... which is from Santa Con, Paul, or  with a forward by Chair Diamond and Robert Spilski. So, a collection of people from Stanford, Chair Diamond is not from Stanford, the rest are. And so, heavy hitters on that book, which is about the benefits of nasal breathing. And in many cases, nasal breathing is more advantageous. The mouth breathing for all sorts of things, cosmetic face, special, kids, boarding-off infection, et cetera. With the physiological side, the best way to do it will be double in health. You can't only do that through now, just do it through now. Just want to do all through your nose, which is this anchor's back to some underlying neurology or neuroscience. So for those of you that want to know, you have two breathing centers, one that's involved in rhythmic breathing, for your nails followed by excels, one of those one of the cells. So called pre-botsinger nucleus named after a bottle of wine and discovered by Jack and then nearby nucleus called the perifacial nucleus. discovered by Jackville in the CIA. And the perifacial nucleus is involved in any time you double up the inhaler, so a double up the effect sales. It was designed so you could breathe while you're speaking, because you can't always go in hell outside. That's speaking. So, I tell you this not to overwhelm you with knowledge, but just know that when you double up your inhaler, your double up your effects, your activating your perifacial list, and it has other cool effects, because it's located near the neurons that control the face. It also has a tendency to walk. the jobs interblading to a school, speaking, stuff, and stuff. Tongues, all of a sudden we'll do this physiological side, we tap into neural circuitry that allows us to support clearly to control the muscles of the face of a job that is not saying certain things are stressful and just generally to relax. And so this brings us back to the neuroscience of this person pathetic nervousness, this calming system that's been genetically coded into us. the whole have regardless of who our parents are, which is that the neurons that control all this stuff face the eyes, et cetera, are all working together. And that's why when we get stressed, it's hard for us to speak, or we tend to jitter and these kinds of things. Just  all the neurons that cause stress, the center of the spinal cord, are working together to get our body out. Okay, a lot of science today, you've now got physiological size to, , the excellent, precise breathing to slow your heart down. And inhale, scale your health. So let's think about something. Let's think about stress from not whether or not it's a cute or clon, whether or not it's good for us or bad for us, but on three different timeskins. Because then we can arrive at what this is all about as it relates to emotions. Trust me, this has everything to do with emotions. Whether or not you're functioning well emotionally or not functioning emotionally. Whether or not you're hoping or not coping. Those are typically psychological terms and psychological. of the discussion. We are entering this through the portal of physiology, stuff of medical textbooks. We will arrive at the psychology soon, but I really want you to understand the difference between the three kinds of stress on three different times. That's a short term, medium term, long term, and what it's good for at that. I think we've all heard stress about this. Pictures intended for right in us, they are great news. It's a long brain on the left. It's a health control. It's a stress level, right? With or, just hit the campus, very well. Memory, smaller, stressed. Alzheimer's brain. It's worse by stress that people are predispositioning. It's getting stressed higher. It's a stress, it's a stress. Deposodes. Here we go. Addics, relapse, stress. Okay, get it. It's very important. I think we've all heard now. so many times it's stressed that. But in that conversation, unfortunately, it's a clips to some of the really positive things that stress does for us in short. So stress can be short term medium term or long term. Long term stress is indeed bad for all the reasons I just mentioned and many others. But what's never actually been discussed is what stresses so terrific for positive for short term. And I think we tend to overlook an important question. which is what is short term in what is long term. No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic, what is acute, right? Is it fine? And it's fine. Is it a duration of final exams or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college? No one actually draws boundaries around this stuff, even general guidelines. And so it's become a bit of a mess frankly to try and decipher this whole space around stress. So I'm gonna try and clean some of this up for you. They still won't know the sun to date up. First of all, acute stress when the stress response hits, that is good for your immune system. I know that might be a tough pill to swallow, but it's absolutely true. In fact, stress often comes in the form of bacterial or viral infection. And the stress response is in part, organized to combat bacterial and viral infection. Their pathways from the same brain centers that activate this, on drugs. There are other neurons in your brain that activate things  your sleep, which will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge for income bacteria, viruses, and the mob and kill them. So short-term stress and the release of adrenaline in particular for epinephrine, same thing, is good for combating infection. This to me is just not discussed enough, so that's one. here and it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about, but I don't often get the opportunity to talk about in such an appropriate context. It's not that it's ever inappropriate to talk about, but what I'm about to talk about now is the use of again, respiration, breathing to somewhat artificially activate the stress response and that will accomplish two things. I'll return to medium and long-term stress, but I want to say short-term stress is good. Because dilation of the pupils changes in the optics of the eyes, the quickening of the heart rate, the sharpening of your cognition and in fact that short-term stress brings certain elements of the brain online that allow you to focus. Now, narrows your focus, you're not good at seeing this whole picture, but it narrows your focus and allows you to do these what are called relation path outcome types of analysis, allows you evaluate your environment, what you need to do, you primes your whole system, better cognition. new system, combat infection. How will make sense to think about the fact that famine, thirst, bacterial infection, viral infection? Vaders, all of this stuff liberates response in the body that is designed to get you to fight back up against whatever stressor that happens in the psychological bacterial, viral, again, stressor response is generated. The tool takes advantage of the fact that when it's rental in the body, is released in the body. From the adremes, it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs, particularly from the cell's organs, and the reactions with the cathartis. The combat infection, the way this works in the real world, is that's captured by a study that could be mapped back to so called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof breathing. is so named after so called high-spent with Poth. We, of course, this Dutch eat-pipe, self-titled dare-double. And indeed, he has many, many Guinness records for things  swimming under icebergs and going up to jarrow shorts and cross deserts, without water, et cetera. Things that are quite dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. And with, obviously, survival is alive. But there are two components to a sort of breathing protocol that he developed that was based also on what's called tumo breathing, TUNM-M-M-O, so we were a wham that was tumo breathing. And many people call this now superoxygenation breathing. Although the breath work of this Yenados will probably say, well it's not superoxygenation because you're also going along. Off a lot of carbon dioxide. What I'm talking about here, regardless of what it is called, whim-ho, tumo, or superoxygenation is better. rapid the liberate breath. So it's the liberate hyperventilation. Why would somebody want to do this? Well, the liberate hyperventilation done for 25 cycles. So inhale exhale, inhale exhale. Typically it's done into the nose out of the mouth of those questions. If you do that for 15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, you will feel very alert. People who have anxiety will feel anxious. The liberate hyperventilation is on your tongue. However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing feels that way and it's because that pattern of breathing rapid movements of the diaphragm will liberate adrenaline from the adrenalence, so it's the release of a drink. I mentioned that when is also called the ice? Well, that's because he actually discovered this pattern of breathing somewhat and again it maps back to tumo breathing by going into cold water. When you go into cold water, that too is a stressor. liberate adrenaline response water. So you get into an ice bath, cold shower, you will immediately release a adrenaline, dreamtals. There are all sorts of things related to this about psychological, troll, stress thresholds, talk about. But I really want people to understand that when a adrenaline is released in the body, you are in a better position to combat infections. And so whether or not, you breathe very quickly as disciples of 25 breaths. Regardless of what you call it, doesn't matter. adrenaline is released. If you take a cold shower, a adrenaline is released. If you go into an ice bath, even if you do it, not only a adrenaline is released, you are mimicking the stress response. And that adrenaline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections. And this was beautifully shown in a study that was published. And a very fine journal that proceeds to the National Academy of Sciences. Yes. It's literally called proceeds of National Academy of UF. say, ship from other ecosystems, other green food. The way that experiment went is that people were injected with endotoxin or in some cases they were injected with a bacterial wall that mimics infection and it gives you a fever, makes you feel nauseous and it's not pleasant. Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing that looked very much  the spread, go of doing 25 deep inhales and exhales followed by an exhale holding their breath and repeating 25 inhales and exhales holding the breath so that something  this or listening sounds  shh shh shh shh shh 25 30 times you start heated up start feeling the adrenaline response through the breathing adrenaline we've got an exhale hold your breath for 15 seconds and then repeat and then typically after doing three or four rounds of that they would inhale very deeply and hold that's how I wanted to. emphasize, never, ever, ever do this anywhere in your water. People have passed out. So, go and shower water, rack out. Die, don't do it in bathtub, do hot tub, don't do it in your swimming. Please don't do it anywhere in your water. Please don't do it at all unless you get clearance to be a doctor. Because there are some pulmonary effects. And the breath holds, she definitely not be done by anyone that has a lot of coma, pressure, and certains of your eyes. But these repeat it cycles of breathing that liberate a drone. And now where the group, the developer, are called to essentially experience zero symptoms from the ejection of this colon, which is remarkable. They had much reduced or no symptoms. They e-vrish, they didn't sick, they were vomiting, they were down. Rhea, which is remarkable, but makes total sense. I was thinking about the fact that short-term stress was long-dent. It's typically called the acute stress response. It's designed to combat all stressors. In fact, we're you to cut yourself very deeply while out on a height of wood. The other thing that would happen is that there would be a rapid inflammation response. You always hear from the physician's dad, the physician's, there's this Alzheimer's. The patient is the worst thing, but the swelling is associated. The inflammation is associated with the recruitment of things  macrophages or microglueas, it's neural tissue. Cells in our brain and body whose job is to act  little ambulances rush to that site and clean it up and indeed the inflammation response looks. It's a horrible, sounds horrible, but it's a great thing, a short term. Who want to have that tissue marked as untrubble and walk by react. So if you're getting peaks and stress from time to time throughout the day or throughout the week, you are in a better position to combat infection. You're in a better position to heal your wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen in the stress response. Now of course the stress response isn't always super empty. sometimes it's milder. Sometimes it allows us to just focus on something. To be able to deadline, that can be stressful, but that's one of the reasons you procrastinators out there, people always ask, what can you done for procrastination? What can you done for procrastination is you can understand what's happening, which is that you are self-imposing, stress, because stress acts  it's blood. Is a powerful neutral bit. You get asked about neutral bits. The most powerful neutral bit or smart drug is stress. It's the concern of failure. It's the desire. to do well. It's pending deadline. It's the, oh my gosh, I have to do this now or it's failed. That is the best neutral that will ever come. That combined goodness. Talk down. He's been a whole month on this episode. One bad track, two months. Okay, so short term stress great. He is to get it to turn the stress response off. Done. In fact, let's just really tamp down relationship to short term or keep stress response. section. Many of us are familiar with the experience. Work, work, work, work work work work work, work, we're taking care of a loved one. Stress, stress, stress, stress, and finally relax. Maybe we even go on vacation. How now and time? We can get to break the same. That's for days. Everyone responds crash. We just need to crawl. So, please understand this. Now, many of you might say, well how long two hours, three hours, a lot of you out there that really likes specials. It will vary for everyone. would just kind of use a rule of thought when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep with good sleep. It's you who see episodes on sleep, one more about tools to sleep. When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep, you are now moving from acute stress to contrast. You need to be able to turn the stress response off. I have one wish, I have many wishes for this lifetime. But if I have one wish today that I hope we permeate spread out there is this idea that we need from it. young age, but in as adults, forever we need to learn how to turn off our stress response. Physiological size one. We're going to activate our stress response intentionally by ice baths, cold showers, cyclic hybrox-genated breathing, aka tumor-breathe-wim-hop breathing. We also need to learn how to press the break. Okay, so let's think about the stress system. Noes how to activate itself. Now we're talking about the way of deliberately activating your stress system. Let's try a little more. I do this from time to time. I might feel a tickling my throat, or  getting kind of run down. I will do this kind of breathing. I do. I will take 25 or 30 breaths, exhale, hold my breath. Hold my breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold my breath with up to 10 seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold my breath with 25 or 30 seconds, then a big inhale. I hold my breath until I'm at three. Again, I feel it's safe for me, right by my doctor. So it's fine. Should not do this. I must as well. for you, but I do this. Some people  the ice bath. I rarely do the ice bath, so maybe we'll  cold showers. I  hot showers. So I take hot showers, but I do this kind of green. Again, they are all having more or less the same theft of precinct adrenaline, which allows you to combat. Infection, is your activity response. Okay, so I'll talk about medium-term stress. Medium-term stress is gonna be stressed at last anywhere from several days. several weeks. I think that's long term stress. There are times in life, we are just dealing with a lot. This particular quarter happened. Of course, a lab of food. This I enjoy all these things immensely, but I'm kind of near my threshold. I'm near the point where any additional thing  I can go on the website the other day and I'm supposed to be the most intense thing in the world at that moment and I can laugh at myself for showing that I caught it. That typically wouldn't be my response. of the issue to I wasn't push-up. What is this medium-term stress? What is stress-thresh? Well, stress threshold is actually our ability to cognitive, legally, what's going on in a body. So we're all here too, so much about we need to unify our mind. We need to be at one with our mind. Now I realize I've got a book on it's language, but the reason I book funny is not because I don't think it is value, but it has no specific. What does that mean? I think I'm all body of every portion, to cross the limits. There, right there, next to body. There actually is a syndrome where people feel disconnected from, who's this real clinician. People actually will seek out reputation, or try to convince doctors and take some money. It's a really terrible thing to do that. Have it relates to it, but change in central maps, brain food, not most of us want to keep our limbs. Worked on our limbs. and everyone's a captain and most of us feel one in mind of body so much so that stress hits, we feel it in our mind, but a lot of stress and isolation, a lot of managing medium-term stress on the time scale of weeks, so maybe in a couple of months, and I thought you had years of stress. A lot of that has to do with grazing our stress threshold, it's about to pass, and there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our past and stress, and they look a lot  the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme. And then when we are feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitive, mental, emotion calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response and environment. So unlike trying to unify the mind, but it all calm, it all alert. This is about dissociating mind, but in a healthy, and what would this look ? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice, because I mentioned before, you can just visualize your size. Real-time, you can use the cyclic hyper-oxygenation breathing to combat infection, if you're trying to run down. And there's also a way in which you can use things  pull-challers, work. Exercise and bring your heart rate up very high. You can feel it's a high intensity realm where your heart is eating a little bit harder than comfortable with. You can feel some feel for some people who think it's lacking gas and they won't be hungry. What the burn is, the flat gas is filled up hydrogen or whatever. I don't want to get into that, but we're all familiar with the intense feeling of the muscles kind of burning. It's working for hard physically. The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind. while the body is very active. And what that tends to do, there's a limited amount of research on this, but what that tends to do is it tends to create a situation where what once felt  a lot seals manager. You've raised your stress threshold, your stress capacity. One way that you can do this is kind of far. If it's the proved by your position and you're able to do this, you can bring your heart rate up. You can do this through an ice bath, that's your thing, or pull shower, or click oxygenation, or anything heat, so... You'll hear it on bike, wherever it is, it brings your heart rate up. And then what you want to do is you want to actually try and calm the mind while your body is in the sight and sensation. And that's the way that I'm aware to do that, again, goes back to physiology, not psychology. When we are stressed, our people's diet, effective that people's diet is to create tunnel vision, literally narrows our view of the world for some time. There's some other effects as well, but that's because the visual system through this great older system that I just heard is tethered in his part of this modern-on criticism. By deliberately dilating your leaves, needing not moving your head and eyes by deliberately going to tunnel vision to broader grammar, literally see more of your environment all it wants. You don't have to run this, not running this moment. But it means that the liberty dilating your case and see yourself. environment in. It creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular certain components associated with the virus. Now this is very powerful. If you're running for instance, you're at max capacity close to it where you're kind of hitting an 80-90% of maximum on the bike and dilate your gaze. Plan is the mind, relax, love the bodies, and this relates to work that various communities require our work. It's important to be a little bit, it's a form, not really of stress and occupation. It's more about raising stress threshold so that the body is going to continue to be in a higher nervous high reactivity, high out, but the mind is calm. So this isn't about unifying model, this is actually about using body to bring up your level that dissociate not the clinical dissociation disorders, but dissociating The mental or emotional response was my husband gone mad and over time to do this, , a couple times , to do this every workout, but if you do this every maybe once a week or so You start being comfortable at entire activation states what once felt overwhelming when a lot of work now is Manage So that's fruit navigating Stress now there are other tools as well, but we don't want to go over 90 minutes because 90 minutes one Side work I want to go into every little bit of this. I want to make sure we get to a motion. But I want to emphasize that medium-term stressors are hard-monged, hard-weakers, and we're going to put our support on 10 weeks. That comes more manageable when we train ourselves to calm of mine winner. body is active. And you haven't noticed most of the tools I'm describing today are nothing  the sort of okay safety meditation. I'm not actively avoiding saying the words NSDR non-seeky stress that talks a lot about those tools during months on sleep and their opacity and of course they're wonderful through a punishing your ability to infert or focus. Please do try and check out NSDR protocols see if they're right you the hard to perceive. Or miss this. script, we have links to them in previous captions, and talk about that before we can find it again. But today I'm really talking about tools that can learn to dance with stress to in short term. You set stress response to it, you have to uncomfortable. The medium turned comfortable with the side levels of activation because life is going to continue to come at you. You can't pick the stressors, but you need to be able to function at a higher capacity. And then there's walked. Now long-term stress is bad. You do not want a drennery type of your system who are a very long time. In fact, ideally you would have your stress go up various times throughout the day, but you would never stay elevated and never put it in your face. Now that isn't real. I would say, for me, three, four nights out of a month, no matter what I do, I take on too much or something happens. This is life and I don't get the best I see good up. might be there. Many of you, it's 30 nights. For some of you, it's zero nights. Graduation's two zero nights. One people, if you are managing your sleep really well every night, that is fantastic. Really you want to be able to fall asleep at night, stay asleep for most of the night, get up and go back to sleep. That's what I define, to help you get your dreams. Check out the episodes on sleep if you want tools to be able to accomplish that. All accomplish that. Done. are tools to be as zero cost-times. So let's talk about long-term stress. Earlier I talked about how breathe can modulate heart rate through this loop that includes the brain and person that serves system. I don't think I mentioned this and I want to make sure that I mentioned that breathing control and heart rate through this pathetic and person that is the basis of what's called HRB heart rate variability. And we know that heart rate variability. ability is good. Don't want your heart rate chronically elevated for chronic blood. Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate. Indeed, if you're in shape, stroke volume of your heart greater and you can have a nice low heart rate years ago when I was running regularly, my heart rate was down  50 or 60 or something  that. That's great, but now it's a higher nap because I've run over the last, but everyone needs to determine what's right for this. them, but you don't really want your heart rate to be chronically low or chronically hot. Both are bad. We know that chronic stress elevated stress and especially in the so-called type day personalities creates heart disease, the killer most every country but in particular, U.S. because of the way that adrenaline impacts those blood vessels strict, some and dilate others. It's just that kind of hypertension chronic hypertension. just bad. And so chronic stress truly is bad. I want to really make that clear because I have to size a lot of what's on the positive effects of stress, but you want to be able to tamp down your stress real time. You also want to be able to modulate your stress and emotional relationship to stress and body. Medium term, but by no means do you want to be stressed out all the time, chronically, months and months and months and years on end. The best tools. test mechanisms that know to modulate long-term stress might surprise you. First of all, there are going to be the things that don't surprise which is everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep, using real-time tools to try and down the stress response, etc. That's all going to be really useful. The data really points to the fact that social connection and certain types of social connection in particular are what? are going to mitigate or reduce long term stress. This is a particularly important issue. Nowadays where we have all these proxies, surrogates for social pollution. Online texting with people a lot. Connected people are  the planes about to take off. It's just a joke. You have your flying or not. That's a big issue. We love you. Pete, you whatever it is that they're trying to communicate to people. Then, , plane land we've found out. of community, what's up? But everyone has this kind of need to stay connected to one another. Humans are incredibly social creatures. Now, there is a way to look at this whole business of social connection, not from just the kind of wishy washing, which is effective. And I want to point out that sometimes I'll say wishy washing, new age. I have nothing against that. I just, my goal here is always to put scientific data, or chemistry on things, so that those of you that are. into wishy-washy-wage stuff you also arm yourself. It's arguments for those of you, the members of your family and your life, maybe aren't so tuned into the typical language realm or some practices  low connections with key, we all get out of some toasts and actually,  that connection between individuals rarely causes the release of octetism. Oxytosin is released very particular circumstances ... 會小點是什麼? Baby and Mother'll butt down, associR... Cheer up! with kind of really intense kinds of pair-bonding things of mother and child, also father and child, but especially mother and child because it's really interesting to watch patients. Couples post sex, these kinds of things that work with  deep layers of our biology and oxytocin is not just released when we walk in and , pat the dog on head or we see somebody give him a hug and I'd great to see you, , fist bump. That's not a situation for oxytocin. The way to think about social. connection and how it can mitigate. Some of the long-term effects of stress is really through the systems of neuromodulation, serotonin, and through blocking certain things that are really bad for us to be a social isolated things  tacky turns. So let me explain what these are. Serotonin, again, is a global oscillator. Neuromodulators are a little bit  playlists in the brain. They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood of certain brain circuits and body circuits. And... that others will not. Ceretone in generally, and I realize very generally here, but it generally gives us feelings well being at very high levels. List, and it tends to make us feel  we have enough in our MPEF. This is why some of the side effects of anti-depressants that elevate Ceretone actually help a lot of people with Ceretone symptoms. But the side effects associated with drugs that increase Ceretone in tend to be reduced affect and one aspect to make people feel. So,  the libido is lower, desire goes down because body has some serotonin, bring us to serotonin and what it is. But serotonin, pharmacology aside or taking into the press to side, topic for another time, serotonin tends to make us feel good when we see somebody that would recognize the trust serotonin is really strong. That has certain positive effects on immune system and on other systems. of over-pair and work. Synapses things that really reinforce connections. Great. Prevent that long-term, win-the-rean connections. So, serotonin is tied to social connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. No, I am very attached to my dog. I hope he's attached to me. He's asleep mostly the time, so I don't know him. Just wait, I don't really know what I'm asking, but he seems more or less to be attached to me as well. And there's no scientific evidence. that it has to be human human attachment, I do have attachment. As well, but you can have attachments to a few of people, some of those romantic attachments days, real-year attachments, non-romantic, friendship, pets, even attachments to things that just delight us. One of the things that really can mitigate against the long-term negative effects of chronic long stress is not just having fun, you're all just having to play, have fun. That can be a little bit of a tough concept, especially for the hard driving people of people that are stressed. But having a sense of delight, a sense of really enjoying something, see an engaging witness of, to sub-painted. That is associated with the SIRT, and certainly play is one of those things. Social connection varies from one to two. Those are things to invest. Some people might say, well, nobody wants to be my friend or someone wants to engage socially. I'll be the first to admit, social connection and friendship. relationships of all kinds, to animals, working humans, or inanimate objects, takes work. It takes investment, takes time in not needing everything to be exact where you want it. I have a friend who struggles with this and oftentimes the conversations just circle back to the fact that when you want social connection, you often have more flexing, you have to eat on other schedules and then you have to know necessarily the most of that moment or stay up a little later, wake up a little earlier. Social connection is something that... work for, but it is incredibly powerful. I want to of course tip my hat to, , so let me approach call them the great Robert's full speed night, Callie Cooper, for sure. No, at Stanford, of course, has talked about this quite a lot, so I've been wanting knowledge of Robert's incredible work and discussions around this. You can look up this material from line, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, looks, but primates and we are primates, we're, we are social species, and as Robert is for, never before. in any primate history, but the Purdue and human history have we interacted with so many strangers at a distance when we are not really connected to it. So finding just a few people even want or an animal or something that you delight in. Believe it or not, has very positive effects on mitigating this long-term stress on improving various aspects of wildlife as it is stress-in-motion now. So that's the social correction. What? is that social isolation, it goes too long, it's associated, everything for flies, we were not priced and humans with small, a tacky turning. Tacky turning is a molecule that makes us more feel fearful, paranoid, and in pairs are immune systems. And so tacky kind of is  this, punish internal punishment signals, our body and our brain telling us not spending enough time with people that really trust, not spending time doing things, really joy. And I have... I often think about tackling kindness for myself because I'm pretty hard driving. I have a lot of pursuits. I also have a lot of wonderful people and incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life. But there are times when I can be so gold-directed, so emotion-trying to accomplish everything that I sometimes forget about tackling kindness. I  to remind myself so much so that I actually have a little post-it above my desicis-tacking kindness. To remind me, tacky kindness is very sinister. All of you will start speaking secreted. When we are not so... actually connecting them up. This is why long meals with friends, family, when they're talking about bump to moment, but where there's no intrusions, even if there are, just feeling  we are connected, suppresses tapping on you. And tacky kind in something really want to avoid because chronic isolation, chronic and high tacky kind. It's associated with long-term stress, really deplete so many good functions of our brain and body, and promote so many bad ones, including irritability, current, and the way. fear, etc. that is really something to avoid. And so I want to highlight attacking kindness to avoid. I don't want to completely disregard Octatocentosin. It's just that Octatocent is that builds up a lot of media and really serotonin works on much faster times skills. Now how do you know if you pay attention to that recognize the skills. Humphrum Trust lists the light. And those are not weak terms. Those are not within this area. psychological turns, they are every bit as physiological as movement of your muscles with a speech adrenaline. And many people focus now on gratitude. gratitude is a little bit subjective and here we're moving from some objective to perspective, subjective things, but recognizing and in particular writing down, basically, however small they've seen, does seem to have a positive effect on their own serotonin system. Now there are plethora of things that will also. will be an allowing to modulate your long-term stress, do so  you do. Stress. We don't have time to go into all these reports, fun. Diet, nutrition that's right, exercise that's right, sleep's good, all that. But do not under emphasize the social connection part. Please, as well, there are some compounds that are not anti-depressants, although if you need anti-depressants, that are not anti-depressants. Follow their advice. that's what this is right for you. There are compounds that are not prescription compounds that can module the stress system and sometimes because of the way that life is we just don't have the opportunity to control life to control our response to stress and at least for myself I can only talk about my own experience. I found it useful times chronic stress to start modulating some of the or chemistry related stress response we're to help now if the doctor prescribes you congress control work or prescribes you some other hormone or something. That's important, but what I'm talking about now are non-prescription things. Should check out Xamin.com, the free website, which will allow you to put a key supplement and evaluate that supplement with, they provide links, this will call human effect matrix to PubMed, tells Zack's subjects, done in post-perpossent women. Kids was a normal adult with autism, et cetera. Check out that site for any and all substance or ever. are taking highly-recommended, no relationship to them. I just wonder what site that's curated all this important. But some of these compounds are effective in how they can take the edge off and I will use them periodically on myself. And so I just thought I'd mention them as a third number of you that are interested in them. The three I want to focus on and one that I think you need to be cautious about that mention or include Aschewaganda. But it's all. Well, let's talk about melatonin. First, melatonin, I talked about drinking lump of sleep. Melatonin is hormones predatory, the pineal, direct relationship to how much darkness you are in, not emotional darkness. But light suppresses melatonin. Melatonin helps fall asleep, but doesn't help you stay asleep. I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin as supplemented typically at very high levels. Wanted to kill milligrams, more. more that is how registly high dose is super super physiological compared to what you normally make. It also has a number of potentially negative effects on reproductive access in hormones. There are some people to take it out thumbs. it and that's your thing fine. I just want to keep you back to the issues you should check on this.com. Talk to doctor especially kids, melatonin, suppresses the root of your spots and our species and talk about negative things of melatonin except that people can take too much melton. a tonic, often turned when they're taking it to sleep or whatever reason, yes it can reduce anxiety and stress, but it also can reduce the output and get to renewals to the point where it can come up problematic. Now, I note about adrenal burn-out. There is actually no such thing as a joint burn-out. Not at all. The adrenals have enough adrenaline to support 200 years of stress. Concept of adrenal burn-out. has origins in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Han Selye, who actually discovered what he called the General Adaptation Syndrome discovered a lot of things about stress. It's a nominal work that you're not in the truth. That has stressors, or something called distressed, you just got to be stressed, which is positive stress, and you stress, it's never really caught on. But he had this theory that the stress would not long enough to be eventually reached a stage called Sostion. That turned out to be raw. Although we're going to have you make feel exhausted, I'm impressed. There isn't really a physiological exhaustion. That eventually got picked up. Ran with general public to go out. You won't burn out too much coffee. You won't burn out. Here all this stuff. There is no such thing as a dream of running out of your dream of being out. There is something, however, called adrenal insufficiency. Cinder of which the real physiological problem where some people have very paired dreamals. I can't tone it, taking at very high levels, periods of time or too long, can cause suppression, cortisol and happen after periods, fordrenals can create a pseudo, adrenal and sufficient syndrome. So, beware melatonin for that reason. Please, I've tried, I alone can't get rid of the phrase adrenal burnout. I'm not trying to give a hard time to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted, but it is for other reasons. It's not. You can just be burnt out unless you have an average. It's a syndrome. So I'm not a fan of Melatonin for a lot of illnesses. I'm pretty sure that the other is Elfine. I've talked about Elfine in which provided it safe for you. Can you take in 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams about a 30 minutes or so? We're sleeping. It's a transition. Just sleeping. That's a sleep for many people. It increases GABA this inhibitory neurotransmitter. Brainates has to turn off our poor brain a little bit to reduce the activity of our thinking systems. that's for sleep, but he and E. has also been shown for people that are chronically anxious, chronically stressed. If you look at the studies that have a large collection of studies in front of me right now, if you want to see those links, I know if you want those, go to examin.com, put in T-need. They linked, for instance, it is known to significantly increase relaxation for studies listed there with public links. It is known to have a minor effect on anxiety, but each studies have shown that, which I think is a fairly large set of yourself. studies, some of them in great journals, but also can reduce task completion. So, anxiety related to task is not good for the class of native paths, but those either are chronicly stressed. It can increase attention a little bit, you can do blood pressure a little bit, you sleep quality, etc. Definitely as a notable effect on stress to studies in particular, that it notably reduce the effects of stress. So there's a lot there, it also has effects on salmion, blood-lookered profiles, go to zamid.com and check it out. But this is one reason why I supplement sleep. I'm feeling a lot of stress. I'm not managing my stress very well. Short term, medium term tools that I talked about earlier. I might start taking a little bit of uni, especially for late afternoon, just  I tend to start to feel  I'm having a lot of stuff done. And the day is kind of sharing on. So you can blunt the response to stress a little bit, which is why a lot of companies are now competing into energy dreams. I am... Not a big fan of most energy drinks, most of them have touring, which I know some of you wrote to me. So touring is great for all these reasons. Torrent also has effects on the micro-basked nature, and it's me, we're not good at talking, first thing in micro-basked nature is square it. My eyes, which is why I'm not a fan of any energy dream that's important. Or touring, general. That's just me. You have to decide if you want to share the comment section. Probably a tour, this is out there. But I love touring. Great. Keep touring the business. Go. and I'd  people to know that it may or may not. The other supplement to be very useful is Ashwaganda. Ashwaganda is known to lower anxiety for you. There is six, there are, excuse the six studies that collectively show reductions in cortisol, which is cortisol is typically associated with waking up in the morning. Good, that's a health, grief cortisol bomb. It was a way, but right at the right time it is. It is, right, correct times of day  the morning. But you don't want court as all chronic the elephant. That's associated with all bad stuff. I'm stressed. There's a very strong effect of Ashuganda and find those business. They report cross six studies, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction in court as all in otherwise healthy but stressed. Now I don't know about kids. You have to look at what the what the what says on most things here are adults. Please check carefully. But this is great. I mean the opportunity for me anyway to be able to take something that can help me reduce my cortisol so that I don't get something to long term effects of stress. And I'm not going to take a shot gone to do a round. I won't do this if I was feeling it was an energy pressure stress. Well, so I don't take it on the basis. You take it one at a time. It's right. So particularly stressful. It has their five other studies that show reduced stress. So that's not cortisol. Measurements but things ... T cognitive impairment, et cetera. It does lower total cholesterol, which may or may not good, or bad for you up to 10%. So some people don't want their cholesterol. It's fine. cholesterol, talk about this in the month of my wounds, but cholesterol is the molecule for which testosterone and estrogen and one's all that matter precise. So you don't want to get cholesterol so low, then they're also to be the one to try either. Mild effects in good clinical studies. on producing compression, probably associated. That's stress. And some other things as well. So, Ashwaganda, something I use from time to time, it's not interesting, healthy and mean. I rarely will use those during the daytime, except under conditions one, but stress. So, check out the humanifact matrix on examiners.com. Again, if I'm an online website, I think I've sent them a few emails before, that's the only exchanges I've ever had with them, but I just think it's wonderful so they put together these resource. Otherwise, be stuck in my pub mad, they collated it, they're taking us from pub to pub, so terrific. Social connection and self-identitation, of course, diet exercise sleep on long stress. Now, we're finally in a position to talk about what we have set out to do ining, which is spend the month on emotions. It's very important that we discuss stress, discuss incompetence, short-medium long-term. Just got some tools for short term, medium term, long term. Control, I don't really want to say mitigation of stress. Stress is going to happen, but our ability to modulate control stress, build off-monitions, using tools such as respirations, tools such as dilation, using tools  such, maybe something. Certainly take care of your sleep, nutrition, exercise. Get tons of resources and information on sleep episodes. There will do a month on hormones on exercise, etc. But let's talk about emotions because in subsequent episodes we're going to talk about OCD, we're going to talk about depression, talking about mania, we're going to talk about dopamine, all sorts of things. But at the core of emotions is this question, what is an emotion? Well it's complex. There isn't a single brain area for an important reason. Polymoscience. Fine. more than I think the modern science, psychology, and neuroscience. It's pretty well aligned with what Lisa felt there it is. Lisa's at Nordie's journey of research about the lab there. She's a little expert. Motion's just written two books that are really wonderful. One is how emotions are made which was the first book. The second one is seven and a half facts about brain. It's a wonderful book as well. what I'm listening? I hosted Lisa on Instagram live. want to be a good pop-tast lucky. We don't agree on everything about the neuroscience of emotions, but I subscribe to most everything that I've heard this is a particular fact that emotions or context depend on cultural dependence, et cetera. I look at things mainly through the lens of physiology in neuroscience and low-level circuitry. And one way to think about emotions that I think is consistent, I think we say generally approve, I can't speak what I would which generally improve the subscription, is that when our internal state of stress or call matches the demands on us, or is mismatched over the conditions on us, we tend to interpret those as good or bad. Let me give you an example. I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside. And I have a lot to do, that doesn't feel good, but it's really no different than if I'm very tired Just a bit of my desires, Because there's this mismatch, I'm not in the right internal state. The internal state is correct rather to meet the demands that, so both cases were out to tired or out to stress who would have due, the valence meaning the value that I assigned to that is I don't feel good. It's not a good situation, I don't feel, I'm , oh, it's stress, I'm  calling, anxious, I'm , call it worried, I'm , call it number, it's not good. However, when I'm tired and I want to follow. sleep well that I feel good because that's what the man is. Sleep and retire. I'm wide awake and I fall asleep and that's not good. I tend to bend the brain to intense to go down the direction of the term situation. So while the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced and more elaborate, one way to think about your emotions, whether or not your internal state is matching the things that are on the planet. So in that way we don't really. place so much value on whether or not we've learned or sleepy. We only place value of whether or not that alertness, whether or not this will blow stress or not, or sleeping is whether or not we're falling asleep or just a little bit drowsy, whether or not that matches the conditions that we've been. And it's a useful framework to have and it's the reason in part why I spent this last hour and a half or so talking about stress and having control stress. One reason we did that is because I think it's valuable opportunity to learn some tools or just stand stress really learn how to take control stress with all better. You're a guardless face. The other reason is that when you start to understand how this kind of seasauce is this autonomic herbicides takes you for a alert and calm to stress full blown past that past. What's the sleep, drought, to passing out time? Dr. David, that's what you're doing. But, co-hung, right? That you're basically honest seasauce. All the... time and where you are on that sea saw of alertness of calmness, positions you to be in better reaction to the man's that fits whether or not the thing that you face is fall asleep or listen quietly not react you now know for instance that if your job is to take that maybe you're going into your job evaluation or your in a relationship where you're there was a call for a discussion somebody talk to you about some talk about some going into learning to reduce that stress response a little bit so that you are in a position to hear the information better. I would have a previous episode if you close your eyes here. I would have talked to you a few more years ago. You will be able to modulate that stress response and lean into life better. You will be able to react to things in a more effective way and not be. reactive and this is really one of the important things to me anyways that so much of the language around psychology which I was at wonderful field but pop psychology particularly is the responsive not react will great then how does one do that well one does that by modulating their short-term stress response in the tongue not by saying hold on meditate hold on and massage and then I can have this conversation by modulating the reactive the tongue how does one for instance be mindful which is a beautiful concept of how are you mind? Well, I don't know. When I'm moving through my day a lot of times, I've just tried to get things done. And as soon as I start monitoring, seeing what I'm doing and kind of third-personing what I'm doing, it actually takes me out of these fact-edits in a spring. So for me, sometimes that mindful because that observer is they call it, it's something that doesn't help, it actually hinders. What's important to me is to be able to work and focus and into little things . To be able to do an honestly grasp or to be able to step all asleep. and we're working hard until 9.30 to put my head down in 10 o'clock and be out, cold, sleeping, 10 o'clock. That's possible if you can burn to control this stress response. And to do that, you can't use the mind to control the mind when you're tools. And so a lot of the people who grumpy or anxious or depressed, a lot of that, provides not for some underlying chemical reason that's chronic. We rest for a pool. worked from knowing  the world is bearing down on us. And so rather than take us check to view of this, I take the view of objective physiology. What can we do? That's anchor to the normal systems, body, brain, eyes, dire, etc. And look to those as tools, levers that pull on, push, and maneuver through life in a way where we start to feel  you have some agents. You actually have some real control. So I think that ought to set the stage for where we're... head next, which is to talk about all the things that you normally get to the motions, half, it's  all,  joy. And we will get into some of that. But all of that, rest firmly on the foundation of this called the autonomic nervous system, this stress modulation, this calming modulation system. And again, whether or not you're activated or you're calm, is not good or bad, it depends on the situation. Certainly when you want to fall asleep, the things activated good, which have worked in the things. So, I hope today you're able to take a slightly different view of this thing we call stress, not just see it as evil, but see it as powerful, useful, certain contacts, great for us and certain contacts. And problematic in other contexts and as well to think about the various tools that I presented that can allow you to adjust and modulate your internal levels of alert to so-concicyly more effectively to life which includes social connection. and the work you have to do. And of course, acknowledges that the events in the world are beyond our control. What's in our control is how we react to something that's commonly said in the wellness itself, health and psychology world. But for which they're often aren't as many concrete tools that we can really look to trust in real time. And of course, there are other tools out there. As always, I'll say it's a striped accurate, but I'll never be exhaustive. I might exhaust you your chopped smile. with this discussion today, but in all seriousness, my goal is to bring you tools and information so that you can manage better. Thanks so much.

As well, you could recommend the podcast to friends, family members, co-workers that you think would benefit from the information, maybe send them a link. If you , that's tremendously helpful. Today, as in previous episodes, I've touched on something. as they relate to supplementation. As always, I always cover a lot of tools that are zero cost tools that don't fall just in anything at all, behavioral tools. But I mentioned some supplements that I particularly find useful. With supplements, it's a complicated landscape often because many supplement companies don't put in the bottle what they say is a particular product. We've partnered with Thorne, THOR, E because Thorne is a supplement. company that we know to have the highest levels of stringents. It's by Mayo Clinic. It's by all the major sports organizations for that particular reason. All these standards are exceptional. If you'd  to try any supplements, see the ones that I take. You can go to Thorne, THOR, N-E dot com slash the letter U slash human. And if you do that, you'll get 20% off meeting that's listed there on my page, as well as any of the supplements that you want to sell. So that's the one, THOR and E.com slash the letter U slash human to get 20% off of cells. In addition, if you want to follow us on Twitter, there at human lab or Instagram, Human Lab, I also do some content on Human Lab, World Zero Science Post. Some of our reposted clips from the podcast, other are unique content that we'll find on the podcast Follow us on Human Lab. Also, if you , check out our Patreon Patreon. and most of all, and as always, really appreciate the time and attention today. I hope you practice some of the tools at the right for you. I hope you think hard about stress and how you control your stress and above all, as always. Thank you for your concerns."
