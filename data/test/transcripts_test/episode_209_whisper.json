That's. what we're talking about, except so the Golden Gate Bridge. Who's a pretty good chance  what we're talking about? It's often named as the most photographed bridge in the world. Is that it? Yeah, it's my second favorite. What's your first? Hmm? Okay, gotta be the BB. Okay, all right, what about you? I don't know, I don't know that I have a favorite bridge. I think  the ones that look  sailboats. I just see with those. Yeah, those are nice a tower bridge in one it's also quite pretty sure and then I'm gonna sound so of noxious but in Budapest not it not just No, just be  which favorite bridge oh minds and Budapest oh now But they have I think seven different bridges and they went they did seven different designs for all the bridges They go through the city and connect Buddha to pests Right and if it really is  a city of a amazing bridges. They're all just really well-bought and they're just this cool. I agree. I forgot about that. We'll also, I mean since we're shouting out bridges, we can't not talk about Pittsburgh because I don't do a baseball game there. And that beautiful stadium, and you get the beautiful bridges there, it's love. Yeah, it's  eight bridges stadium? No. Yeah, is it? Is that right? Yeah. Okay. 8 or 12, I think they call it 8 or 12 bridges stadium. The does. That's right. So back to the Golden Gate. It's also one of the seven wonders of the modern world. Right in there. Yeah. And the American Society of Civil Engineers named it one of the bridges of the millennium in 2000. So it's a well-regarded bridge. And if you've always wondered or always thought, hey, I guess the Golden Gate bridge is called that because the weird orange colors. Roughly golden? I don't know. Would they  me? Probably  you Chuck. And... that would be your wrong. That's right because Golden Gate very much predates the construction of that bridge and with that we can't understand. Okay I'm gonna make click a horse sound while you tell the story so this guy will be writing a horse okay. You got two ads of coconut and you banging them together. 1846 this is the Mexican-American wartime that's going on and there's a army officer in the United States named John for a month. who basically said without sounds  without even asking anyone. Hey, California's independent from Mexico. At one point he was crossing the San Francisco Bay there from Sanoma. Two San Francisco to fight the Mexican Army there and he named that mut... Really? And he named that mile-wide straight that connects the Bay to the ocean. What would that be? So, filet? Can't stop. Oh no. Here we go. I guess Chris Ophale, which means Golden Gate, and later on, rather than the Greek version, he went with the English, and that passage was called the Golden Gate. That's right. So this is the bridge over the Golden Gate, right? Did  that? No, not, I was yesterday, or is old as I say. Yep, so yeah, and the Golden Gate in particular is pretty neat, not just because it's the connection seems to go big to the Pacific Ocean. But geographically, it's  300 feet deep right there. But on the shelf in the Pacific side, it's much shallower. And then in the bay, so the bay's  an average of 14 feet deep or something crazy  that. So it just suddenly goes  this huge suppression. And this is what they need to cross. a 300 foot depression through the Golden Gate with a bridge. And I think the first person to ever suggest it was a guy named... crawls crocker and one of the reasons they needed a bridge truck in the first place because if you ever look at a map of San Francisco it's actually peninsula. It's connected to the south to the rest of California but there's a lot of stuff to the north of that. It's of the north you have to cross the golden gate so people were  we've got to get here to there  we marine county we  a head of luma we  to say head of luma at least it's also lead us another submarine say. you So they started with fairies and that worked just fine, but it's more and more people showed up. Tim's just goes a magnet for immigrants, especially after the Gold Rush of 1849. They were , we might need something better than just fairies, especially if we want to run real-world cars. Yeah, and Jack that fairie was expensive, man. Yeah. They were actually just  tanker boats, but they would double his fairies and say, yeah, sure we'll take it across. It was $2 a head, which is almost... 70 dollars today. Yeah, and you got a 70. Yeah, I saw 77 dollars. You That's even more outreach. That's and they gave you saltines and grape coolate. That was the only food you had on board Just  that so then Baptist food That's what I had in their shoes. Actually it really comes from That was pretty good especially to your church and your part of her So Oh, there was finally one call up the princess. There was a side wheel pad oil steamer egg guess that was the first official fair. That happened in 1868. That guy Charles Crocker, although he back in 1872, so we need a bridge and there's why he said we need a bridge, because he was a railroad guy and he said we need to get railroad stuff for people, we need to move lumber, we need to do all sorts of stuff. So let's get a bridge. Yeah, and people are , there's no way. That's two miles and everyone's ever built a suspension bridge that long. And 1960. It was a San Francisco sunjournless who used to study engineering named James Wilkins. He said, now I think we can build a suspension bridge. It'll be 3000 feet and it'll cost in those days dollars. A hundred million dollars first, which is almost, I'm sorry, it's more than 3 billion today. So everyone said, that's probably not going to happen either. So eventually it took a city engineer named Michael O'Shaana say to be on the lookout to say, we... We do need a bridge, but we gotta get this POSLOAR. And in Lucid, a guy in 1921 from Chicago named an engineering Joseph Strauss who said, here's what we do every one, it is possible. But it can't be a straight suspension bridge all the way over. And it can't be just a cantilevered bridge. The suspension will be too flexible and flexible and flexible. Those winds and the cantilever will be way too heavy. So if you do a combination of the two, I think that's the winning idea and it'll cost you take the seat of all. the 17-year-old. Yeah, that was much more in line with what the city and the near-new that the city of San Francisco were willing to pay for the rest, right? Joseph Strauss, he became the central figure of the Golden Gate Bridge. He's often petted as the man who built the Golden Gate Bridge. Genuinely unfair thing to say because so many people contributed so much to it. But he was not a shy person, he could work with. just about anybody. He knew how to work the system and he was on the self-promoter, but he definitely was after the acclaim of being the man who built the goal. So just kind of put that in your pipe for later. Right. Don't smokey. No, no, don't, don't spark. But he, in the city guy named Proul's Ellis, who is  the, I don't know how you would describe. I can't think of an analogous movie character, but I feel  we can get him a crop. but he was obsessed with making sure that this bridge was not going to collapse. Yeah, I would describe him as a math was he was the guy I think we did when we did the New York Subways episode. We talked about the tunnels that went under the Hudson River. He was a guy that came up with that ran and so that's a pretty good dude to get if you're trying to build a bridge that no one thought could be built at the time. Right,  super super math guy. Just keep math in your- head because it was a C math would end up being his undo. Yeah, but he was not after it claimed he did not, I get the impression necessarily know how to work with everybody or work with the system. He just wanted to do his math stuff, right? Yeah. So he was a good guy to have in that sense. And one of the reasons why it was so because the design process was so long, at one point as we'll see, this is completely scrapped, straws as I de-instarted over. Yeah. Fine, it's things also, if thing, I mean, Strauss had gotten it. down to an estimate of 70 million. And I'm sure anybody who was paying any attention was , we should play an unparalleled at least double that. You should have that right. Yeah. But the state was interested in us that in 1923, they passed the Golden Gate Bridge in Highway District, California, which basically said to the people in the surrounding 21 counties. Hey, you guys want to get in on this and basically vote for a tax district that can create debt to borrow money, basically it. start counting. What do you think? Yeah, and they said, well, what does that mean? That sounds weird. And they said, well, it means that all of the businesses and all your homes in your county are going to put a fiscal lateral jointly against that loan. And surprisingly, maybe six out of the 21 counties said, we're in. We see this progress or something that we need as far as the remaining counties that weren't into it. Some of the obvious reasons they just did want to do that. A somewhere about. also barons and  hey this isn't even going to be enough other people didn't this was the early 1920s so it's still  kind of I mean it was a bustling city for 1920s but there were areas of rural  ruralness sir across the other side and  they were  we don't want it this bridge  we got livestock over here and we're cutting down our lumber and even back then they had conservation is agitating against stuff  this, notably the Sierra Club was  we didn't want to bridge in that beautiful bay and there were a lot of other people that came out with a lot of good reasons to bring up lawsuits  Erkweik so it was 119.06 that was recent enough to where  what about this Erkweik thing  what if that happens? Yeah the first big one. Yeah. Shippers were  well  we can make it through the Golden Gate to the Pacific pretty easy right now where we're going to be. little worry that just building this grid is going to hamper our ability to make mad cash. The Department of War, which had a heavy presence in that area, is , look, we run, , really important worships in and out of this harbor, we're worried that this grid is going to block our progress, but then also we're worried that it's going to become a real target for saboteurs and that they will blow up the bridge and block the harbor with the debris. And then the southern Pacific Railroads. stepped up and said, we run the fairies, so we're going to lose a bunch of money if you guys build a bridge. So all these people together were either parties too or have their own lawsuits against the bridge authority saying , no, you can't do this. And against all of those odds, the people in favor of the bridge men's so overcome. Yeah, and before we break, I do want to mention before we get some email. We mentioned the Department of War not in, , been to the beach pit, hexaf. That was the original name that later became the department of defense I got the which of then oh again now. Yeah, is now To the tune of what I just read was gonna cost a hundred we've had million dollars Change the name back to So another hundred you 25 to change it back to the fence apartment Probably so so I just want to point that out. Let's take a break and we'll be right back So the first design this hybrid design was pretty ugly. Those are critic that said it look  an upside down rat trap. So they said, all right, we got a redesign this thing. This kind of look good. Ellis gets together with consulting engineers. beyond. I guess it would be Moisef and O.H. Aman and they got together with Strauss and they said, alright, let's go back to this old idea but a new design of a false suspension bridge. Yeah, the longest one ever and it will end up being the tallest one ever at the time, at least because , all the winds in the water and the boats and everything, this thing need to be tall and super long. Yeah, and it also need to be tall because the angle of the cables to hold. up such a long deck had to come down at a crazy angle, which meant that those towers had to be really tall. So this is going to be the tallest bridge in the world, the longest suspension bridge in the world, and they're , let's do that. Let's make the impossible happen. And it's both pointing out, Chuck,  these guys aren't using CAD. They're not using any sort of computer. They do not exist yet. They're not using calculators. They're doing all these calculations by hand, using their noodles. Keep it rules. Slide rules pencils  that's how this bridge was designed that's how they calculated the stresses on it That's how they figured out how to engineer it all by hand and using their heads. Yeah, with amazing They did all kinds of testing obviously some some pretty impressive stuff as you see I they created a model that was 156 scale took it to Princeton University there in New Jersey and Did a scale down a equivalent of 120 million pounds of vertical load to test to make sure those towers could take that. Pass that test. And  I said, there was so much math going on eventually Strauss got irritated. So the guy Ellis that they hired because he was great at math got fired because the math was so irritating to Strauss. Yeah, Ellis later recorded that Strauss said that the structure was nothing unusual and didn't require the time that Ellis got necessary for it. I also saw Elf. where somebody's safe that Strauss was envious of a resentful of I guess the respect that Ellis got on the board whenever he went and spoke to them. I could see that. So yeah, this is, and I also think that Strauss is getting leaned on. He was the one that was getting pressured to meet the time. And Ellis was , no, it's going to take six months for that. So finally Strauss fires Ellis in the most  cowardly way a person can. He forces him to take and then before his vacation is over, he's, sends him a telegram seeing your fire. Yeah, that's pretty bad. Ellison received a lot of credit at the time, and in fact, he didn't get a lot of credit until after he passed away in 1949. So we're taking our head off to you. Mr. Ellison, for your great work, for your great math, because we are both math. This is ourselves. And we have a lot of respect for math. That's right. He also, he didn't have anything to do. He couldn't really find much work, because this was during the depression when he was fired. He went. back and he went over all the figures he get all of the calculations to make sure they were right he was spending  70 hours a week and he did and he was , it's been more even though no one was listening to him he wasn't being paid for it. He just wanted to make sure that this thing was what that's great So in 1928 they kind of mired their way through or got their way through the mire of the legal activity and all the protests and everything the state government California said the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District is now a thing. They're going to pull off every facet of this bill. And in November 1930, the district issued $35 million in bonds to finance this thing, which was a problem at the time though, because it was during the Great Depression, obviously. And they couldn't find any buyers for these bonds. And all these legal matters were scaring people away. And so they turned to kind of one of the heroes of this whole thing. 1932. guy named Amadiyo Gianini president of Bank of America. Yeah one of the most revered and respected banks in the world, everyone loves Bank of America. They're basically a mascot here in West. That's right. And he was also just a California hero. He kind of kick started the Hollywood movie industry and the California wine industry. So he was a guy to go to and he was , I got you. I got a big room with six million dollars over here. And now buy those parts. and you can get started on your project. Yeah, which is pretty cool. And he is one of the heroes for sure. So they got started. They started during the depression as we saw. And on the one hand that meant financing it was difficult. On the other hand it meant that they had a huge pool of laborers to tag. Because there are a lot of out-of-work people. So they got everyone they needed, basically immediately, to get started. Started on January 5th, 1933. And there were a lot of... issues that construction faced that made this a unique construction job. Every day, four times a day. So two times in and two times out, the tide brings in and takes out 390 billion gallons of water through the Golden Gate while these guys are trying to build their bridge. It's tons of fog, there's a lot of storms, there's high winds. It was not just  a walk in the park  apparently the bay bridge was to build. Yeah, apparently the bay bridge. which is more impressive in some ways and was built in finished before but it didn't get nearly the press because it was just an easier job overall. Right, it's  eight miles long, just the exact distance from downtown Detroit to Eminem's house. Yeah. And that didn't see that coming. And he said Detroit, that didn't mean to you. Nice work. Alright so it's a difficult job. Super, super hard because the terrain and the water and the wind and the fog and everything going. on the North Tower was built on the Marin County side. I'm coastline near into a very strong layer of basalt and sandstone. And that's great. So they were  the North side is fine because the stuff is very very sturdy to build into. The South Tower was about a thousand feet offshore and a bit of serpentine rock. And they went, this side is a little trickier. So we're going to have to take our time with more. Yeah. So they got this guy named Andrew C. Lawson. These are great examples of how many people work. thoroughly involved in this because every person you mentioned in the story just imagine there's dozens or maybe hundreds of people working beneath them in coordination with that person. He was a geologist and he basically took to test the bedrock. I'm not exactly sure how he did it, but he put the equivalent of a railroad box cart fully loaded that amount of weight and forced onto a 20 square inch air. And it held up fine. It's a thing. It is. I could not find out how we did that exactly. It's just such a spectacular way to put it that I guess everyone's , Oh, and care, that actually happened. Yeah, just don't you did it. And then he put on the old timing diving suit and diving bell and went down to the bedrock and hit it with a hammer. And apparently if it makes this sound  a ding-ing sound, that's what you're looking for because not only is it strong, but it's also flexible, which... going to come in handy whenever the sand on dress gives California the big one the 8.6 magnitude perfect that everyone says inevitably comes. Yeah, for sure, in order to ensure that the stability they have workers dive 90 feet down but explosives down to blast out even more rock so they could go even deeper, had to get rid of the fragments, to even get out to that tower and they have all these materials so a lot of big construction  this is constructing things so you can do the construction. And that was a case here so they had to build a road basically on a trestle just to get out to that tower. And then they had to protect this thing from  being bumped into by a ship. Yeah, if you look at the concrete foundations that the towers are built on, you'll notice that they're  oval. And those were designed to basically act as fenders kind of. if you play bumper bowling, okay? It's basically  that. And imagine the bowling ball is a ship that being captain by somebody's not paying attention, probably on his phone. Yeah, yeah. And they will hit that fender, the bumper, and it will keep them from running into the actual tower itself and because of the oval shape, hopefully kind of push the ship away from the fender itself. Yeah, while the captain says, that's it. This is such a beautiful way ever in here. Yeah, they weren't that think they said they it looked  a giant bathtub So what they referred to it But , they filled that thing once it was peeking about the surface partially with concrete pumped out the water Reinforce it was steel more concrete and all of a sudden you've got a they protected tower with that That billiards bumper bowl bumper bowl That you called bumper bowl oh? Okay, I thought you were talking about  bumper And then a bumper bowling where they put those guardrails down and then got her. Yeah, we were bowling that last week in Ruby's to- I did. I can still manage to miss pants. Bumper bowling, but- Oh, I thought you meant to swallow gutter balls  that. You can't. No, I didn't even even bumper bowling. I couldn't miss the chance. I did the usual. I know I mentioned this before, but with bowling, usually for- And I think the other day I hit  a 140. And then  a 7. I don't remember those good? I mean 140 for someone who doesn't bowl much, I feel  it's a pretty strong number. Is that due to a hay-sus level game? Oh no, no, no,  300 is a perfect game. But I mean 140 means you put plenty of strikes and spares and probably had a good last frame out. That's what they call it. But 70's bad. My whole point is though. Is I'm good for one game and then might my game really drops off? No, okay, where you jump at? the second game, none of them had one beer, a PBR draft, Stylicious. Yes, sometimes it was very once. Yeah, I don't do that much anymore, but it was super refreshing in delicious. Great. Yeah, oh, let's check this one. Yeah, and PBR. So you want to take a break? Oh yeah, we're there already. We'll do it. Okay. So, Chuck, they got the foundation cord. It's a nice fender, a bumper around the towers. Apparently, once they got that foundation done, they erected the south tower, which was the more difficult, which in towers, the one closest to San Francisco. They erected in  six months, which is really amazing, especially if you find  that added up that was not an anomaly for this project. It kept  hitting milestones ahead of high. And that used quite a bit of steel thanks to Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Pennsylvania. As we know from our Christmas episode the reason it is Bethlehem Pennsylvania's thanks to our Moravian fans. We do it since our New Jersey chip chip chip got it. For sure, I don't believe... the more evils headbushed through a naming church. No, no, no, but as far as the steal. Okay, yes, and so Bethlehem Steel provided 44,000 puns of steel for each tower. That was each tower. And this is not  a fixed thing. They prefabricated them, put them on a bar, and then sent them to San Francisco, down the East Coast, past Florida, through the Panama Canal, and then up to San Francisco. That's how every single piece of steel they fall. fabricated steel made its way to the goal. Yeah, that's right. The Panama Canal, they get there. They obviously use giant cranes to lift these steel sections in place and start kind of just putting this thing together  a kit at this point. And at this point, they haven't even, , eventually they had temporary elevators built so people could get up and down quicker. But before that, when we take a worker 20 minutes just to climb a ladder, we can't imagine how terrifying that would be. Just be... time a ladder that high that takes 20 minutes to find. But that's how my god is in the top. And then we get to the color. we mentioned before, it's not named Golden Gate Bridge because the color because it's really not golden in color. It got there. we said, prefab then it was painted with an orange red, red, red primer. Just to kind of make sure it made the journey there okay without getting rusted out. And once it got there, consulting r Stephen R. evil holding r detect. Irving Maro said, man, that looks pretty darn good, everybody, what do you think? And everyone went, woolly, woolly. And so they started searching for sort of related colors and ended up landing on what is now known as Golden Gate Bridge International Orange. I would have kept my mouth shut, but I would have been looking around  this thing. Right. That's... I don't know. I mean, to clean the person. But... Okay, so one of the things that is great about that. color orange and I think one of the reason people said boli for it was because it didn't it didn't well harmonize with the surrounding area. It's nice, hilly, shrubby. It was a good choice for sure for that and I think it also kind of plated a lot of people too there  it actually kind of goes with that. Doesn't stick out  a soil from. So it was a good idea in that international orange is still used today. You can thank international orange for the color of your life's best. If it's orange, that's right. That is regular international orange. The Golden Gate Bridge International Orange is a little different. It's  a variation on that. But  you said, it blended in well and it also did the job that was really supposed to do was stand out for ships and boats there in the fog. Rejected colors included silver, black, and then black and yellow, which was suggested by the US Navy,  , stripe, black and yellow because that was the best color. visibility. It's the best color for Christian metal too. It's funny because I can that stripper the stuff looks so good but can't picture a bridge in yellow and black stripe. It just looks to safety industrial . Or a cliff? Yeah, yeah true. Did the dude the drummer from stripper have black and yellow striped drumsticks even? I think he had it black and yellow striped everything. I don't know if he... See, he had a black in yellow strike no one. I don't know if he's a black in yellow strike no one. I don't know if he's a black in yellow strike no one. Let's keep going boy. That's good. Alright, so Mario, we mentioned Irving Mario, he's the consulting architect, too, said, , I  this color. He also obviously played a part in a lot of the aesthetic. A aesthetic, a aesthetic, a decisions, a good ending, but also bad. No, get ever say it. If you're gonna see tonight, let it be decisions. One of the things that he designed, aesthetically, was to make it look a little taller, was those tower panels, priests, and size from bottom to top. Pretty good idea. Yep. And that, well, I guess Lawson was , let's do this and let's add a little bit of this, maybe put those on top, kind of thing. Strauss, who again is the man at the center of all of this, he was way ahead of his time as far as safety goes. Apparently, the song... They approached and kissed the first one that required hard hats on site, which is not fairly ubiquitous. Yeah, it was cool. Yeah. And then he also created a safety net that was movable. So I think the people who were in the highest risk of falling to their deaths got to use the safety net while they were up there work. Yeah, and use it they did because that thing ended up saving the lives of 19, instruction workers. They became known that those... in the end. In the end, 11 people died from this project, which is pretty good. I mean, it's awful that 11 people died, but for the time, they would say  for every million dollars of a project, you can expect one death. And it's a very good thing. It's pretty good. I mean, it's awful that 11 people died, but for the time, they would say  for every million dollars of a project you can expect one death. and this thing came in it  35 million or so so they expected  30 to 40 deaths and there were only 11 so that was that was it I guess a win for safety for the time pieces. Yeah for sure. I find that a really strange rule of thumb for every million spent you can expect a death  I guess what that's based on is just the compact yeah pieces by the price I think so you're the height something yeah probably just that means it's it's big and difficult and complex. But it's definitely a cool thing. It actually is. So yeah, there's 34 people dead in one person's , how much is this bridge can cost with at 35 and you're in that? There's this cost over runs and  what that means? So they've completed the towers, both towers in 1935. Remember they started this whole thing. I think they started building that temporary roadway to the first foundation in 1930. one. We're moving along. And after the towers were complete, it was time to create those four iconic cables that are the actual things that hold up the road deck, the bridge itself. The point of the bridge is held up by these cables. And if you see one of those cables in person, you'll find that is three feet, one meter, 36 inches of the C-ON-DUIT, a 300 centimeters. And let's see, it would be a third of a decometer in with Irendian. And it's actually made of 25,000 wires. Each of those cables are all twisted. Yeah, and to get that done, they hired John A. Roboings, Sun's Company, the name of company. And they had worked on the Brooklyn Bridge, so they were obviously great people call for that. But  you said, I think he said, it was completed, they had a schedule. This is April 1937, about a $1,3 million budget. Just a little housekeeping here. It's 1.7 miles long, 90 feet wide, holds six lanes of traffic, two sidewalks, 746-foot-high towers, with the mains span between them being 4,200 feet, and at his midpoint, I've just been hanging 265 feet above the average height of the water. below and people were really excited to get them. They were an opening day. First day they let pedestrians across. The next day was cars. And at the greened opening, I think this kind of gets across the person just, He read a poem that he wrote for the day. And he was a poet, so it's not bad. I  the rhythm of it, the meter. Sure, is that correct? Yeah, I think so. I would say I'm going to look it up and read you. himself in the canarytip is called the mighty task is done by Joseph Strauss. The thing that bothers me aside from a couple of clunky lines, he says essentially  that all the people who were involved are glorified and that no selfish urge stains his life, no envy, greed, intrigue or strife, and I'm  dude, he specifically didn't mention Ellis, Charles Ellis. At this whole thing and then he goes So he has the audacity to say that that's not being done here at this grand ceremony. Yeah, and they built a trellis, so you had a word there in the bag. That's a good point, Chuck. I don't know about Strauss now. Yeah, he's not really talked about  that from what I can tell I just kind of put this together from different places. There's a, there's a, there's a, bronze statue of him and go and get part, I think, but, about him his amazing seat. And it's just, I don't  people  that. Who take full credit for something that hundreds or thousands of people have done, and that they did  backbiting along the way with it. This is, I don't, yeah, I don't  it. And with it. Yeah, actually had a trellis line, he was , , he was a trellis. Hmm, I got nothing, yeah. He scratched it out  Ellys's outside of him. They were holding the sign. The math kicks out. I saw that no one can say for certain. whether Ellis ever saw the Golden Gate Bridge itself. I'm sure sure that he went and saw it at some point because he died for a decade or two. Yeah, good decade after it opened. So I would guess unless he had horrible version that just bought it at the bridge. I'll pay for it. So we can compare it to other suspension bridges in a few ways. It's really interesting. It's got a lighter roadway than most. It does not have train tracks on it, but it seems  that was one of the original ideas They wanted to train to be able to run across that thing But they realized that the winds were real problem in 1940 after the Pembo Nero's Bridge Disaster and they saw those things in 40 mile an hour winds twisting around we need to because we get winds up to  75 miles an hour So we need to stiffen this thing up So they added horizontal treases to stiffen this thing against twisting and that's what brought the total weight of the deck to high basically to where they could not end up putting railroad tracks. No,  they were close to the limit of it. That's right. Yeah, good. Okay, so the Golden Gate, it was the longest-spentian bridge until 1964 in the Vereson and Neros to go over that for a while. And  we said, there's Golden Gate Heart. That's that predates the bridge. But Golden Gate National Rec- creation area was created on either side of the bridge after the bridges already around for a while. And there's some pretty neat things about it. One of the things we'll remember we talked about how people were worried about earthquakes. Well, it actually survived the Loma Prieta earthquake, the 1989 earthquake that took place when the A's and the giants were playing each other in the world series and just killed a lot of people on the Bay Bridge apparently a section of that collapsed. And the goal-engate survived with no damage, what sort of a  a close very little of it. Yeah, pretty good. There, and this is something I heard early on in my life was that the Golden Gate Bridge basically is in constant paint mode basically. Yeah, it's always being painted apparently,  it takes so long to paint and sort of take care of the corrosion, because of all that salty fog and salty air and water. Right? It's just it never stops. So , all right, we're done and we're going to take a few minutes off. It's continuously being kept up. Yeah, and one other thing about the earthquake thing, they, they, somebody at some point figured out that the San Andreas could produce that most of a 0.6 magnitude earthquake, and then they went and figured out that the goal and gate would probably not be able to withstand that. So they started, I think, back in, well, after the Loma pre-editors, they can 1989, they started a bit of a retrofit, tried to make it earthquake. up to 8.6 magnitude and one of the things that they were having to shore up, Chuck, was that they didn't bolt the towers to the foundation because they're  these are so heavy, we don't even need to waste the time or money on bolts. And then 8.6 earthpick, they realize if you stay in stiffly with your laid stiff and then you kind of fall to the side and one of your feet comes off the ground. When you go back to center again, your feet come down and imagine one of the towers doing that. When it comes back down on that foundation, they're ... That foundation is not going to hold that up. So that's what they're trying to read. That's a big footstone. So what they said? So we have to close now with some sort of darker stuff. Because Golden Gate Bridge, if it's known for... It's known for many things, but one thing that's very much known for is that there have been many, many two-asides attempted and completed over the years. They averaged about 20 per year for a very long time. hundreds of others had been stopped by obviously volunteers that are stationed there to watch for the sort of thing Bridge Workers' Cops sometimes just stranded people seeing a movie and they took a very long time to eventually get a safety net even though it was possible it they really dragged their feet getting that thing up didn't they? Yeah I saw that there was an opposition to it that included it will be ugly. So every every I think since The first guy who died by suicide, his name was Harold Wawbert. He was walking on the bridge all the way back just a few months after it opened. And he was walking with a friend. He said, this is as far as I go and he came the first person to jump to his death from the bridge. That was in 1937. What a thing. What a last line. Yeah, imagine being that friend and being , Wait, what? And then, yeah, I can't imagine that. Since then, at least 2000. people, maybe a little more, probably more because I think they assume that there's plenty of people who have jumped in their bodies whenever found. But at least 2000 confirmed people have jumped to their deaths from the Golden Gate Bridge and in 1995 the California Highway Patrol which had been keeping an official count. Stop their official count at 997 because they were worried that there's going to be a rash of suicides to become the 1000 person that's died by suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. So officially the counts. It's 1997, but I think most credible source put it at over two falls. Yeah. And what a thing to think about. What an awful thing to consider, but , thank God they bought of something  that. Because they're probably right, ? What now? The security net? No, the stopping the public count because, oh yeah. , I would never have bought of something  that. So I'm glad they bought it that. It was a really, I don't know what to call it, either. interesting and awful documentary from 2006 called the Bridge. I saw it a mucher, did you see that one? Yeah, there's a lot too. The point was to drive awareness about this and about suicide and suicide prevention, but very controversial in that they captured footage. They had cameras trained on the bridge from the mountains in your body. They captured footage of 23 suicides, including a survivor, and they filmed films. family members and interviewed them about their loved ones. It's very moving and upsetting documentary from Rene C. 2000s. Yeah, it is. So yeah, they definitely raised public awareness in kind of, I think, amplify the public outcry about this. And maybe people would be , yeah, we probably should do something about this because 20 to 30 people a year were taking their own lives at this time, right? They finally finally in 2000, the beginning of 2020. 24. They finished putting up the safety nets, essentially. Let's stick out from the side of the bridge so that if you jump off the side of the bridge you're going to land in the steel net the whole thing costs $224 million and completed suicide drop by 73 percent yeah after they were installed and even more amazing than that I think there were 200 attempts and 30 completed suicides a year on average after the net's were installed that felt to a 132 and in 2024 and there were no suicides in the last seven months of 2025. So these nets are actually preventing people from completing suicide and also deterring people from attempting suicide. Yeah and  they've done studies where they've interviewed people who did survive. Most of them don't ever try again, which is  very encouraging to now. I think those studying in 1970s by a guy named Richard Sidon and he followed up. on 515 people who had been stopped. These aren't people who jumped in subscribe, but they were stopped from jumping in the 35 years prior to the study. You found that only 35, the 515 went on to die by suicide. So that's really great to know that if you can be an EMT or a police officer or a random passerby who can get someone out of that dire situation, there's a very, very good chance that that will be not something they go on to compete. Yeah. And you mentioned those volunteers that are stationed along the bridge just for that very purpose. I would wager that there's at least one stuff you should know, who does that and I would love to do. I bet you're right. And I hope someone comes to our live show and stands for the end in Tulls. Everybody to think about it. I bet you that. Yeah, they will get thunderous applause. I feel  we should end on a high note and the high note is the Gongay bridge was where James Bond. successfully deceit a Christian walk in saving Tanya Roberts in the bargain. That's right. W to a kill. Probably the best bomb movie ever. Hmm interesting. All right. I mean that was the one I grew up on. So that's probably why I  that. There's no kid who grew up on  the living day lights and it puts the ghost limit. Good stuff. Chuck said good stuff. Where I was trying to push him because that unlocks the murderamped All right, this is a chance to plug the sprints of the show here. Hey guys, just finished the episode on the radio, the National Radio Quiet Zone, kind of very fascinating. By the way, we've got a few emails from people coming this out. I want to reach out with a recommendation of one of the Macaroid pods . The Macaroid brothers, just as Griffin and Travis Macaroid have long done. My brother and my brother are me. And I'm going to those guys for a long time super cool dudes. And then they do a show with their death. It called the adventurism, which is where they play D&D, and that's become hugely popular. It's awesome, man. Yeah, it's super cool. But the second season, adventurism is called Amnesty, and it is well-to-table top-worldly game genre of its always D&D. But Griffin has said it in the green bank area. So the folks in that area that attracts in the lack of communication is a plot device and really drives the story. It's one of my favorites that they've done. I hold stuffy shit. in the heart, thanks for doing what you do. And PS, I love hearing a few of the Macroys on movie crush, I love hearing Josh on Behind the Bastards and so on. All of my favorite podcasters, Crossing Pasts, now and then really drives those pure social lines. So go listen to Josh on Behind the Bastards, your past episode, two on a couple of times, right? Yes, I was. Ian Don Dele's at? No, I was on Behind the Bastards once I was on Dele's at this. So I guess couple of times, and then I have... had a griffin on movie crush in his favorite movie which he claims is not his favorite movie only but also the best movie was Groundhog Day. It is good movie and I had just an on and Justin I think I can remember every single guest in the movie still his was with nail on. I've never seen that. Isn't that a more see-album? I don't know but it's a British independent film so it wouldn't surprise me. This is Voxol and I. Okay. With Neil and I, Richard E. Grant, it's really good. I think you and you meet with both , all right. We'll watch it. It's from  the Hindi movie Revolution of the Nineteenths from England. And it's really, really great. , I think I was talking smack nuts and long ago about P.T. Anderson. Both know says on the podcast or not. And I basically hadn't liked anything at his since bookie night. Maybe Magnolia. Then I saw one battle after another and I'm  buddy, this guy's back in my estimate. Not only did he direct it, he wrote it too. It's a good move. Yeah, he right directs all his movies. He, yeah, I loved loved one battle after him. I think it was my favorite movie here. That, that in sinners probably time. I've not seen sinners yet. Is it as pretty good? It's all right. I'll check it out. Don't tell me anything else, fine.
