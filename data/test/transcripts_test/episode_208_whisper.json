Delaware. Sister City, okay, Sister, 2,000 people are serious that you just said, No, this isn't just the story of a missing woman. It's a story about power, corruption, and how far someone will go to protect their image. And we got so many emails, so , account from Rdrenos about this story, because Delaware is in this area specifically. And Wilmington is such a tight-knit community. Someone said , it's the song for cheers, every, it's the same thing. Everyone knows her name, everyone knows everything. Everyone's next to me. to this business. It's a little big city kind of thing. Yeah, so this is  everyone's from Delaware's hometown. what got in the trip? Right. And it's really heartbreaking. The main source for this story is a book by Ann Will. That's right. And called and never let her go. Do you sometimes get upset that we are psychically connected? Because I do. Well, I was new exactly who you were about. Well, so Stephen King? Yeah.

And I see her face on a regular basis because every time I Google, we'll call Case to look at the call Case news. Oh, yeah. That's fucking show, come to first. So I see her face every day. And she's also when she's been in murder, she wrote twice. She wasn't silk stocking. She's been in death of a cheerleader. That one, oh, yeah. She's been in movies, she's been. and all the things. She is the female Mark Harmon. Turns out they just announced two powers. I have to say this too. It's just the second you said the disappearance of Anne Marie-Phay. The name Anne Marie-Phay is such a, that's my cousin. There's a connection there too, separate some small town where it's  Ireland to meet being Irish sometimes feels  a small town, right? Everyone has the same little to the sayer thing and you can kind of , I can see her feel her. Yeah, that's exactly right. We're going to start on Saturday, June 29th, 1996, and we're in Lewington, Delaware, and a third year old man named Mike Scanlan is supposed to have dinner with his 29-year-old girlfriend and Marie Faity, along with her brother, Robert and his family, but Anne Marie never shows up to meet Mike to head over to dinner. Anne Marie works as the scheduling secretary for the governor Delaware, a Democrat named Thomas Carber. She's worked for him since he was a congressman, and she is political and going places and really passionate. about it. I read this one, the little detail and almost me and he cried. She keeps a collection of her ratty childhood stuff animals at her apartment and they all have women's rights buttons. It all look hell, , piddook. Because that's  the generations. , the media says, here's me as a kid, then here's me as a teenager. Yeah, here's what I'm passionate about and I'm a woman in the world to really understand what I'm up against. Yeah, I just kind of  just I see that person so well based on that one that you feel. Yeah, and then. So, Amory, who most people call Annie, is one of six siblings in a close family, which is also very involved in the tight knit Irish American community in Wilton. That's a thing there. I dated a guy from Wilton home in the 10th. And I don't know anything about it. So, if you strap all, you strap all. Yeah. What's that , a nice hash with your eggs? Absolutely not. It's  spam toast. I'm gonna get yelled at for this. Spam toast? , , avocado toast, but spam. I think it's  spam. It's  a chopped up meat, a lot of chopped up meat. Let's guess other even more stuff so that people get angry and angry. I didn't write it more and more about what's grappled. I think it's a cousin of spam. Okay, correct me if I'm raw. I don't mean to say that. I know you fucking will. And I appreciate it. Annie is the baby of the family. She has four brothers and one sister. So they're all little over when she's born. So of course, her super protective over little Annie. Annie's mother Kathleen had died of lung cancer when she was only nine years old. And her father's run. Robert is never the same after this. These struggles with alcoholism. He stops being able to take care of the family. And so, somebody older kids who are now young adults by this point step into taking care of Annie, and they do their best. While they're putting themselves to school, almost all of the older, they, he kids, work at a pub, a local pub called Oofriels, owned by their close family friends. So it is small town, small town. Also, that's just the tragic mom dying of cancer in your nine years. is  the musk. Absolutely. And then the dad was that and not able to hold it together. You find the loses family home when Annie is 15. And so he moves into an apartment in Annie, he's an athlete and a great student, winds up living with the family that she babysits for in order to stay in her high school. Oh, because she is on that. Yeah. And they adore her. They consider her part of the family, but she's just not totally comfortable, , living. She feels  you're a guest or a whole life. Totally. That's awesome. Absolutely. And so that arrangement ends towards the end of high school. And at that point, Annie breethy news back in with her dad and then lives with her two eldest brothers. She's also working in a restaurant and is essentially  a self-sufficient adult, even though she's just 17. It's  that. Take care of yourself. Because you have to you have to. Yeah. And she actually stuck in thrives and makes it. She graduated from high school because on the college, she initially flourishes in college and then struggles with depression and has to take a break. But she gets therapy and grud. She does struggle with anorexia as well as so. I'm not going to do. The Fahey kids, bolstered by that great community at home part of, had all managed to do well in school, get good jobs, and generally make nice lives for themselves. they beat the fuck odds and they really, this great and really went for it. Probably because they have community at sounds . Seems  it's a very helpful thing. Yeah, yeah. ,  you're, there's a family that's , please come and lift us. Yeah. This is happening to you. having other adults to count on when you're a kid at Calon. And here in Cis just a huge part of it. Yep, I'd  to make it. Back in 1996 when Andy goes missing, it's the last week of Delaware's legislative session. So it's first Andy's brother and boyfriend think it's possible that she had been caught up working late the night when she's supposed to be comforted in her. It's normal for staffers in the governor's office to spend the night working at crunch times  this. But then at 9 p.m., Mike, the boyfriend calls Andy's older sister, who's very concerned right off back. And she starts calling Annie's friends and one of the friends who work with her says that she's not working. She just doesn't say, hmm. And Mikey didn't pass Annie's apartment early in the day before they were supposed to meet but a dinner and had seen her car there. And it's still there, even though Annie isn't picking up the phone in her apartment. Annie's land lady says she hasn't seen her in the last two days. No one's really talked to her. Basically, they realized no one's curtain person's Thursday, the 27th, and now it's Saturday. So the lamp. and then he lets them into the apartment. And it's really out of character, the way her apartment is left. It's really strange for her because she's very neat and organized. She's so neat and organized that she stacks her penny so that each coin has Lincoln's profile facing in the same direction, which I'm just picturing Vince, he has to have those faces the same way in the right order and is really precise about that. Yeah, because when you are child, and you grow up in this situation, the rankings are out of your fault all of the time. You learn to get some control in the places you can get it all the way. She has never let's trash sit in her apartment always taking  smaller bags out whenever she leaves. But when they get into the her apartment today, there's rotting produce all over the kitchen counters because she hadn't put her food away. Her groceries away in the kitchen. So there's a rotting sound just so not  her. They also find leftovers from a restaurant in Philadelphia called Panorama that are in the fridge. They don't look super old but they are dry, so... not  super recent leftovers. My assistant Annie had not eaten there together. Philadelphia is about a 40-minute drive in Wellington. There's other weird stuff in the kitchen. There's samples of prescription medications scattered around and packages of food on the counter, but not in the way. Annie's purse is also in the kitchen for wallet is there with cash in it, but her keys are missing. Other than that, the apartment looks mostly way and literally that a couple of small things are different. It's the small apartment modestly. but decorated with Annie's little touches, as I said she keeps the stuff down on most of these things. So at midnight, everyone's worried Annie's sister calls the police and once they eventually get there, one of Annie's friends mentions that she has unheard messages on her answer and she remembers no cell phones, there's a good communication. They listen to the messages which are almost entirely from everyone in the room, but all of them are from Thursday afternoon on since she had it this time, which is very unlike Annie, she always listens to. must be called right back. So, Annie's sister Catherine then shows me something she had found before to please arrive. She'd been looking through the letters and cards and Annie's drawers and found a letter that ends with quote, all I want to do is make you happy and be with you. I love you. And quote, it's not signed, but it's on a letterhead that says from the desk of Thomas Capano. So that is here is Mark right okay. The name Tom Capano. So, it's familiar to Kathleen, the sister of she knows of him. He's a prominent lawyer, I'm a typical advisor from a prominent real estate mammal. But she's rooted out by this letter, obviously both because of the way it ends and because she, Kathleen, is recently mentioned in it. So it's a long letter that talks about Andy's family, with a lot of familiarity as it he and Amy have talked a lot, and she's never even had a, , this dude in relation to him. Right? She doesn't know who he personally is. She's a very important politics. She's worked as a, legal counsel for a previous governor, not the one Annie worked for, and is a political consultant. Tom's father is a very successful real estate developer and Tom's a very successful lawyer, but he has three younger brothers, Newy, Joey, and Jerry, and none of them are nearly as buttoned up a professionalist Tom. Similarly, they all have been involved in various degrees of crime and personal lives and professional lives. Jerry, as Anne Roll puts it, quote, seemed to care for nothing but guns, shark fishing. big game hunting and girls with big hair and clothes that fit  a second skin. And bro, whoo, damn rude, bria. She's gonna say it. She's not gonna spare anyone's feeling that. Can you imagine if your big interest is shark, if no, leash him alone. Get out of here. Get away from big gangs. Have it with the elephants and sharks. So Louie and Joey, to the brothers working with family real estate development business. Jerry is the elucist cannon he can't be in office setting and spitting me. and starts a landscaping business and has a lot of client overlap with his brothers. Tom also has an older sister, Mary-in, who's played by Olivia DuPoccus, Huckin legend, my favorite, such a button. And she's completely excluded from the family business. She's supposed to get in the lounge from her brothers, but they just always fight instead. All this to say, Tom has a very good reputation, but his family does not. When Tom and Annie meet in 1993, three years before the disappearance, he's about 43. she is about 26. This is years' portion that's my current boyfriend. Tom is married at the time, has four daughters. But he also has a mistress named Debbie who he's been seeing for years. Annie and Tom meet up with a fun razor and have a lot of people in common, including those close family friends who on the pub, because they're also very involved in local politics. So they kind of just meet and click and propose from the Delaware families from adjacent immigrant community. She's Irish and he's Italian and it's just  this insular community so that kind of you can hear the recording music playing in the background. Yes, so Annie and Tom have a work lunch together after they meet but quickly after that they start having dinner dates. Annie and her friends are all just starting out not making much money and Tom takes her to nice restaurants because we're about access to the kind of life she has. It's been used to the half before. Yeah, , grooming. That's what they call it. Yeah. And next couple years, Tom and Annie are sort of on and off again, and in between, Annie dates out of her people during this whole period, Annie struggles with her mental health, particularly with her inorexia. And she experiences a huge setback when her psychologist is killed in front of writing accent. It takes Annie a while to find the new one, and in this period she leaves on Tom a lot more. All this time, she writes in a diary, documenting her relationship with Tom and other things going on in her life. By 1995, when she's 28, she confides in her work friend Jill, that Tom seems  he's trying to control her. He's in his late 40s and he's a professional and very, so it's just that, that you can picture that happens all right, because it's  that is part of why he's doing it. It's  he's showing himself, but then he has to control her, because if she steps out of line, yeah, second, he's got all these things. at risk. A lot of things go wrong. That's not in no way am I saying that he was right for no no disgusting and weird. So he's sort of trying to control her. He makes her interview for a job. The personal assistant does his brother, Louie, the sleaze and real estate developer, and it's clear that Tom just wants to keep Annie close and under his control thing. He doesn't take the job, but Tom tries to control how she dresses. He tries to isolate her from her friends and becomes upset and he thinks she's better than too much time with her. It's textbook, troll abuse. Why are all the boyfriends that are so terrible the ones that have  six girlfriends? It's , can you just do this one person and then hang it up, get yourself a paraphernal? It's very, very cheap. Jesus. He also repeatedly tells her that they should end the relationship and then abruptly changes his mind. And there are times when and also tries to end a relationship, but he always guilt her into changing her mind. Around this time, in September of 1990. five, Tom and his wife separate, but this is also in and it's Mike. And it's actually the governor of Delaware who sets the two of them up, which is , you really have to get married. Yeah, the governor of Delaware is , hey, I got a nice guy for you. Have you ever seen or heard of the governor of Delaware? No, because it's not real. I think it's real. Mike is kind and he, , is the same age as Annie and they start seriously dating in October and at the same time. Thomas telling both Annie and his other mistress that he is left his wife for them. Okay, now we've got it. The women don't know about each other. Annie tells Tom she's seeing someone who wants to break it off and Tom starts calling her 20 times a day. He threatens to tell Mike the new boy friend about their relationship even though it seems they're not really seeing each other anymore. On one occasion he bursts into her apartment and gathers every item he's up to give her at this point in addition to Thomas and to Mary Debbie the mistress. he creates Annie. Tom is also having a different affair with a woman from work. I'm surprised he's in her body. So he's just a little heart total, free now, because the wife is probably  enough on him. Yeah. So Spring goes better for Annie. She finds a new therapist. She keeps seeing Mike and Tom seems to be busy with his multiple other women. He's mostly leading Annie alone, but at the end of April, he turns up again, sending a ton of emails from working out of her. He starts out by listening to sympathy by talking about one of his daughters, health issues and soon he's sending little jokes and just kind of reels her back and offering the paper and the windshield that crack that she needs help with and the stress about just the news needs. Yeah, just  white nighting right wherever he can. And despite progress and therapy, Annie's at a point where she's really struggling with her eating disorder and on June 12th about two weeks before her disappearance, she's 15 minutes ahead grazing. , I'm done. Mike, the boyfriend is aware of her history at Aurek's year, but she still doesn't want them to know how bad it is at the moment. I totally don't know before where I used to have a needle this word, right? Don't anymore than then I think. Yeah. Yeah. Well, also, that's talk about it's whole issue. That's what I've been sort of totally. So it's kind of, , it's  bad to worse for her. Because it's  she already has this issue. Yeah. See. has in her life, right? Aren't people that you want, now being you enough? Absolutely. And so she's too  embarrassed to tell for your boyfriend. This is going on right now. And so she calls Tom. He knows all about it. He's been there for years. And he picks up the phone and he drives her home. So, Tom interprets his game, choosing him over Mike. So, he keeps contacting her after this. He offers to buy her things. She keeps saying, no, we often see get the crack. Winself K. and she refuses, she does so very politely in emails, which is still firmly refusing to accept any food. It wasn't an invitation to come back in her life. Then at the end of June, he invites her out to dinner with him on the Thursday night that she would last seen, and he doesn't reply in the email so she does accept it seems  she did so over the phone. So there's an record of it and she doesn't tell anyone about the invitation or whether or not she accepted it. And he gets that leg. We've talked about that scenario before where you credit paint yourself into this honor of moment as where you are because you think for whatever reason that you think that it's now Hey, yeah, it's also one So if any missing her close friends confirmed the relationship with Tom to the police and tell them that Annie had complained about him being controlling There's more of course one is from Tom on his firm stationary Annie had her detailed diary as well that lays out the whole story of their relationship when The most recent entries talks about breaking it off and says, quote, I finally have brought closure to Tom Capano, what a controlling manipulative insecure jealous mania. Quote. So now the police are trying to confirm with anyone to dinner with Tom on that first age in 27th, last time she was seen. It seems that way because of the leftovers that were from the Philadelphia restaurant in Kirkbridge. It's a place they had gone to before together. Headplate is one at this. She had plans in Philadelphia that evening that he will probably be done by 930. So it seems  the point of the hand. And then he's going to go to his name. At 3.30 a.m. on Sunday morning, the 3th, two detectives knock on Tom's door. Tom says he's aware that Andy is missing. He tells the police at the last time. He saw her was that Thursday night. And from the went to dinner and that he drove her that they stopped briefly at his apartment to pick up some groceries. He had bought for Andy and then went back to her apartment. He says he put the grocery back down on the couch. or gave her a gift and used it back in last night's last summer. The detective asked if they can look around the house, but Tom says that his daughters are asleep upstairs and doesn't want them to get scared and refuse to slip them in, and they don't have a warrant. And so they come back the next morning. And so who knows what evidence they would have. This is Tom Kavion or how to work. And when they do come back to 10-AM Tom isn't there, they're finally tracking down. You take some back to the. house to look around, or not doing a full search. But the house looks very clean. It's , the detectives are racing for an uphill battle. And for a publicity, Tom is a well-known and well-respected lawyer with a lot of connections, whose brothers are known to be in trouble with a lot from time to time, but not Tom. So everyone is pretty shocked about this. Actually there's some murdering us and wrote in that said, though, Dad's used to hang out with him, so , in groups who can sometimes, and everyone was very surprised. , he's the good boy. Right. On the outside, he got to shut together. Well, and also that's the ultimate position of being because if you're the one that gets your homework done and goes straight, it comes a lawyer, and then you have these kinds of  dirt, baggy, brothers, two a degree. You don't know these people, but you always look good, and you can always make yourself look good because you're playing that up here, playing your position. Right. But this point, the face, siblings are all working hard to get in. and she's on the front page and all the local newspapers it becomes a huge story because stuff  this does not happen in Wilmington or in Delaware at all. Oh, it was the pub that was the pub for the Fagey's community. It hangs a banner with a photo of Annie advertising a $10,000 reward for information. We did her recovery, which in today's money, $10,000, this is 87, 96. It's less than you think it is. 40,000, 20,000. Any therapists come forward and tells police that she's worried that Tom has abducted Annie because Annie has brought up this up as something she worried about in therapy. And her doctorate. She was specifically worried that Tom would hire people to do it. They discussed this at their very last session before Annie disappeared. She said that she urged Annie to report him to the Attorney General's office. Some people believe that Annie did threaten him that night to do that. And that was what maybe said. Tom, yeah, that would make sense. I mean, that's horrifying. It just means something of every part of law in order when they go to the therapist. And I , I can't tell you. And they're , someone could be right. It's , to get that therapist who I'm sure was very motivated. Yeah. I need to tell you what the last thing she told. Right. Because exactly what's happening right now. I'm sure if I'm not. As investigators learn more about. Tom, they learned that he's had other affairs and has a history of the common threatening and possessive. In one case, in late 70s, long before Annie, he even having an affair with an engaged woman, while he was moving married, he showed up at her bachelorette party and at the wedding and wrote her obsessive letters for months. So he was just unhidden, couldn't stop. Well, again, this is all right, he's a stalker. Then he tried to hire a man to beat her up or hit her with a car. The Civic... They were questing these two things, but the man he tried to hire went to the FBI with tapes of Tom's phone calls. I love when hitmen do that. I'm not that calm and I don't think, , everyone's small, they'll be ,  what? This is against my code of conduct and I'm a hitman. Yeah, and , people are , you're hiring someone to hit them with a calm. Yeah, disgusting, that's awful. But authorities, essentially, at that time, give Tom a slap on the wrist and send him on his wrist. The FBI's called the man is case of the personal request of Governor Carpher, who's Annie's boss. In July, they do an extensive search of Tom's house. They find out that Tom had replaced, this is just , a place to the carpet and the sofa and his living room, the weekend Annie disappeared. Oh my God. He also had gone to a drugstore about a clean product with this fucking name that is just are you ready for this? It's called Carbona Blood and Elk Remover. Oh, sir. That's it. concession at the ace hardware. I know, Carbone, I want to ask the Carbone account. , can you just do five? I wonder if nop stinks and even when you get it up, it still keeps stinking. If it's that's your farm girl. There you go. And I've dropped many a latte in my car. Oh, no, latte is smellin' the car. It's sour. It's fine. I  vanilla latte, it's the week later. Why does everything turn out this way? I do. Sorry, Carbone, I found my family. Don't ask. I got you now. Do you understand? They're  this. Do you understand? What milk is  in coffee? Mell, blood, milk, blood. It's all in there. This search also turns up blood stains on the wood working the living room and on a radiator and on the door of a laundry closet,  blood and Europe. Yeah. So when the ops knocked, he was standing there, right? And if they had just walked in and looked at that room something might have been there. Yeah. And they didn't have a warrant. But... Maybe gotten one, but also he was political, so right, he was a possible, he asked, she's the police officer in the day. But they don't have a body to match the blood, too, right? Because Amy is missing. So the agents learn that Annie donated blood very regularly. They locate, they track down her last donation, right before it gets shipped overseas, to test it. Wow. And the nick of time and the blood is down to be a match. That is some detective work. Right and also fully makes up for having to stand it that way not doing that might have an FBI But because also if it is that overt and horrible of a murder where he just killed her and is living on busy The angry or what everywhere But there's no body and at the time it is very rare for any one to be arrested Should be tried for murder without a buddy in a 1986 But around this same time when they find all this evidence of blood, Tom's brother, Jerry, is arrested on drug and weapons charges. And  what happens to regular criminals. They sit down. Yeah, exactly. So she's , I'll cooperate with you to get the better case on the ship that I'm in trouble with. And essentially completely throws his brother underneath the bus. Oh, completely rasses brother out. Believe it or... And the Tom's older brothers also winds up cooperating. So Jerry and Lou tell police that Tom did kill Annie at his own house and that he put her body in a fishing cooler. On Friday, June 29th, the day after she's last seen Tom and Jerry use Jerry's boat to go about 70 miles off the coast of Stone Harbor. But then the cooler wouldn't sink. So instead they wrapped two anchors around Annie's body and let her sink into the Atlantic and the next through the empty cool. to learn to the water. And when stories make public, to Fisherman come forward, saying they have found the cooler in the ocean, the one described, who operating the square feet. I'm pretty sure, and I could be wrong with all the things we've worked out over the years, but I'm pretty sure I've seen the clip for those fishermen who talk to the news. Yeah, because they found that, because it's  they show it  a floating out here, right? And then love it, whatever. this idea where There are people, as we know, in this world, that if they want you gone, you're gone here. Because they know how to do it and they know those kinds of details. That's remarkable. Imagine. The case goes to trial October of 1998, in Quart Tom tells a different story than anyone ever heard before, his brothers have ratted him out, kind of can't fight that. So he confirms that he brought Annie to his house after dropping the gift and groceries out of house. Wait, can I guess she did something to him? Is it worse than them? Mistress did it. Her name's Debbie. I'm not saying her last name. It's just a bullshit. He's saying that Debbie shows up, discovers them together. They're the scuffle, and Debbie has a gun, and he grabs Debbie's arm and the gun goes off. That's what he says happened. He admits to hiding Annie's body and claims Debbie helped and do it. Debbie testifies too. And she vehemently devised being at his house that night, although she does say one time by a hand. and her name and she did, she says she gave it to him and never saw it again. So all she does is point the finger that he actually has a gun. Well she better because she was , oh no, here's who I'm going to throw under the bus and she's  the one person that actually loved you that thought this was all real and now is finding out you have, , all these other instances and whatever and you're going to blame me. I have Shibongi just  one does it, it's crevant. Mark. Tom's young guilty of first remurder and it's the first time in Delaware history that someone is convicted of murder in the absence of a body or a murder weapon. So they don't have either, but they're still able to commit them. At first, Tom is sentenced to death, but on one of his appeals, the death sentence is overturned since it had been decided by a jury verdict that was not unanimous. He sentenced some life in prison instead. He appeals several more times and his convictions affirm each time. Tom dies in prison at the age of six. in 2011 of heart failure. Annie is remembered as a bright light in the Wilmington community, and in Brandy-Wine Park, there's a bench dedicated to her memory. Ophreels pub were all the fake he kids worked, and where Annie first met Mike, closed his 2001. But until it does the banner with Annie's picture, advertising the verb word for information, meaning to return, remains. And I think there's so many murdering us, that started with this patient down there. Yeah, I mean it's just oh And that is the story of the murder of Gamerifei What a loss? Yeah, horrible. Yeah, always but I mean always always but Man this one. Yeah, okay, I'm gonna turn around. Are you ready? I'm so fucking ready. There are good things to happen in the world. Remember when Then I'll tell you There's a Twitter account called historic videos, but then the handle is history and needs. So I saw this, read it, nice three-pair graph, tweet, and I was , I've never heard the story, and I think people should know the story. And especially you and I, being, you being a native of LA, me being a longtime citizen. If you live in LA, or you watch the Kardashians,  what a big part of the culture here are meanens are. That it's apparently large ears. concentration of our meanings outside of our meaning is in blend out. Yeah, it's a suburb of LA. And so when I started reading the Sides, , oh, this is great. This is, there's lots of people are going to  this. If you don't know, our media is a small landlock country about the size of Maryland. I would wonder how it competes with Delaware, but , , our states. It's a beautiful country. It has, it's actually filled with beautiful lakes and waterfalls. in general, springs, but the history in Armenia is incredibly heavy. In 1915, toward the end of the Ottoman Empire, around 1.5 million Armenians were murdered in a devastating state-sinction genocide, which is why there are so many Armenians in LA. So this story I'm about to tell you takes place 60 years after that when Armenia is under Soviet rule. It is a late September evening in 1976, the work days coming to an end. and dozens of communities are making their way across Europe, which is the capital of Armenia and the largest city in the country. It's a typical rush hour, but it's interrupted by the sound of screeching metal and then a big crashing boom. And people scream in terror as they watch the packed trolley bus, veer off its tracks along Lake Yeravan, a huge res by the city, later on they'll say that perne investigation. driver was speeding, but witnesses will actually come forward and report that he had been trying to prevent a pick pocket from leaving the trolley bus and so he refused to break to let that person off and then he was paid over the head with a metal bar and knocked out. Oh, shit. So then the trolley bar, normally didn't break, but kept speeding and it flies over a curb and then slams nose first into the concrete perimeter that runs around the Resider Wide. It flips a few times and then it rolls into Lake Yervon. And there are nearly 100 people, school kids, factory workers, housewives, retirees that are trapped inside. And seconds from drowning in this very cold lake water. But they are not helpless because one particularly capable bystander in media research to action. Superbian. Kind of, this is the story of a truly heroic Armenian athlete named Shavar. Carapet. Yes, you heard of this? I read in the same style that you found it on  written on a interesting history, right? Yes, the main source used in today's story is a 2014 grant land article by a writer named Carl Schreck entitled The Plunge and the rest of the source's own arching notes. So we're gonna go back 20 years before the crash I described in 1953 when Chavarsh was born into a working class. Armenian family. His path in life is more or less decided for him because his father of Latamir has dreams for his three sons, Shavarish, Kamo, and Anatoli of them all becoming world-class athletes. It's a partially strategic dream that he has because selling in sports is one of the few ways our mediums, especially those from humble backgrounds, can have any kind of upward mobility without drawing too much attention from Soviet authorities. So... a way to get ahead. Yeah. So Vladimir signs his boys up for gymnastics, under it incredibly accomplished Armenian athlete, and Olympic gold medalist named Albert Azarian. Immediately, each of our shows a ton of potential, he said to have a quote, commanding bill, quick reflexes, and relentless ambition. It's the commanding bill that really I think has gotten so made up of it. A lot of this. They also bought a muscle, muscle flex. But even with such raw talents, such harshest coaches don't think he can make a career out of gymnastics, because he begins training when he's a little too old in a sport where competitors peeking out early. And he's  an athlete. But nobody wants to see him these competitive sports because he's so kind of such a natural. So one coach suggests he'd pivot to swimming. And this is out of left field as a reporter called Shrek explained. in 2014. Quote, Armenia is not a nation of slimmers. The country is home to just a handful of public pools. A few of Armenian's lakes and rivers are suitable for swimming. The president of the Armenian swimming federation estimates that only 30% of the population knows how to swim. Wow! A figure he says has changed little since Soviet times. Interesting. I guess if you're landmarked, right? You're not , and maybe they do a little more  standing around and splashing the water at the bottom. themselves and a lake or a stream was nice, but no, they won't get their face wet  my mom. A blue lake would be  always worrying about her hair and me. But Shavarsk commits himself to the sport and he eventually joins a league dedicated to developing professional Soviet swimmers. And Shavarsk is good. He's particularly fast in backstroke and freestyle events and he quickly earns a reputation for being one of our menia's most promising young swimmers. But over the next several years he starts to let behind the other swimmers in his age group. As he grows older he becomes less flexible and he just starts having a hard time nailing down his stroke technique and that slows him down. And then it just 17 years old, Chavarsh is dropped from his swimming. Of course this is a huge gut punch for him. His dreams are becoming your champion swimmer or gone, so he hits a bar that night with a fellow swimmer presumably from Saras. But that same friend. happens to be recruiting athletes for thin sweat. Ooh, it's thin swimming. Luckily, there's a paragraph right under here that will tell you. Fins swimming is pretty much what it sounds . It's an event where competitors race on another with thin strap to their feet. It might be two fins  scuba divers or it could be what's called they quote monofit, which is one big single thing. I know,  a mermaid. That year playing mermaid in the pool. I was to trim , why would they put a shark fin? Can't wait for one more clip. It's a look  you're in the air. And then they chum the water. It's really strange. It's a slope , don't worry about it. It's sharp slope . So Shavarsha's interested. And he doesn't feel  he has any time to waste. So even though he was drinking a combination of vodka and beer all after noon, he says, quote, I took a taxi home, rested up a bit, and came back for my first workout. When you're 17 then, you can do fucking great. Yeah. And also there's part of it's , I gotta do this for my sheep type. future. It's not a hobby. Even for a season to update  Shavarsh, who's been training in gyms and pools since he's a little kid, Finn swimming workouts are next level. And many of them happen outside the pool and their gear-date body conditioning. Spain's a picture Shavarsh's training might entail running upwards of 18 miles around town with a backpack filled with sand structures. It's the OG-weighted best. Yes, and here's the OG-weighted best. He also might run around with a cellos swim around his shoulders I mean rated best Steve Steve the way to the house chicken fighting. It's all classic training He also climbs pills on his arms. Oh Oh, are we crawling up on here? Areim climbing I guess. Oh wheelbarrow style as a teammate holds his leg. How cute? So he asked a little bit of there so they're just trying to make it's kind of  rocky when he fights their rushing the workout is insane but put Russian guy as a fool. That's the fool's fighting him. Yeah. Shavars also becomes known as the guy who jogs with ski boots attached to big planks of wood around his neighborhood to strengthen his ankles and feet. He's in it. He's shot off. Yeah. See, he's 18 years apart. 17, 18. One of the most important skills that Shavars develops in this training is breath control. Infants running competitors might use snorkels for longer distances, races but in sprints they typically hold. they're breath the entire time. So according to experts you can safely hold your breath for around a minute. Some people can go longer but then you're getting into dangerous territory where you can actually damage your heart and your brain. So we don't have an exact number for how long a shabarsh could hold his breath. We know it's several minutes which is pretty unbelievable. Do not tell me this at home. No I wonder, I swear my sorry is  the record is that broken but along this breath holder. Yeah  something. sort of a deep free swim guide or something. Are you scientists and  a lot about it right in at my favorite murder.com I tell everything. I'm top-bred folding. I know because I thought more than a minute I thought you there's some people who do  three years or something but that  I swear recently It was  five. I think that's the same. And  the damage. That's a bit damage unless it just pops you right into being a man Found an article for 30 minutes. for a minute. No The record yet just stop working. Oh, okay You need a current, we need a... We need... We need, ... What do we need? Breath Doctors to tell us all about it? She's a rapper and then he's a... My favorite word to tell her. Also, is your midsection super wide if you can hold your breath for a half an hour? Her purpose? , okay. I'll love to discuss Breath Holding's further murdering as if you had pleased and gave it. So my mom was , my time to shine. Finally, I've written you 10 hometowns of actual sugar crime. And now, , it's my cousin's TV. used to hold his breath to make himself pass out so that he wouldn't be in trouble with my aunt. Okay, so all of this strength training and breast training pays off big time because Chavar's becomes an excellent fin swimmer, he rips through pools  a torpedo and he rarely has to surface because he can hold his breath for so long. At long, early fucking minute. I mean, but also I wonder if one minute was a mistype of merits and it was supposed to be  since there's one minute as I feel  leakage. No bride. Give me a week. I mean, yeah, we don't have to do so much or so. I have to get some bags of sand, vest, folio, Steve, I get Steve with a bit of weight of vest. Get up there. So it just 19 years old, Shavar Shfulfills, which I'll have to dream. He competes on behalf of the Soviet Union in the 1972 European Championship Games in Moscow. And he walks away with gold medals in the 50 and 100 meters in swimming sprints and all the glory he could hold. at magazine rights quote, it's safe to say we'll see this young athlete from Armenia at many more major championships. And Shavar's does since when, as part of the Soviet team in the next two European championships, 73 and 74, he sets world records and takes home a total of eight gold medals. But at this high point in his career, when he's only in his early 20s, he's inexplicably dropped by the Soviet team. No. Yeah. The reason why is a mystery even today, Shavar's best guest. is that Soviet sports officials wanted to showcase more Russia athletes on the team. But Shavarsha's gotten used to having the carpet pulled from underneath him, competitive sportsers, life, and livelihood, so again he refuses to give up. He figures that his best move is to practice harder than he ever has before until he's so singularly impressive in the pool that the Soviets can't help but bring him back to it. And that's what Shavarsha's character was doing on. September 16th, 1976, the day of the child we've us cracked. I think that was pretty good about it. He is now 23 years old running near the reservoir on another one of his Berlin training sessions and he had already run 13 miles with 45 pounds of sand scrapped in his back in a bank account. Which in two days money is  three marathon. I mean, that much sand for me would be  300 pounds. I mean, I can't lift this and I don't know why you're being so nos! joined by his brother, Kamo, who's also a competitive athlete in swimming and other events. So, Shavarsh and Kamo hear this crash of the Charlie Bus as it flies off its tracks into the lake. And before Shavarsh, Chen even figure out what he's doing, he finds himself running in the direction of the Explode. Kamo rushes off her hand that Charlie Bus hits the lake bed and sinks quickly, kicking up a cloud of heavy silks and it ends up resting about 15 feet underwater. Shavarsh acting purely on impulse in adrenaline rushes down to the lake strips to his underwear throws off his backpack and jumps into the water Years later his brother Kamo will tell writer Carl Schreck that quote to this day I asked myself if I It's printed to this scene and hadn't seen Shavarsh in the water. Would I have jumped in? The answer is always the same 50-50 50-50 I think that's really really honest. Yeah, and really ят my first instinct wasn't to say that's what a big deal my brother did but just really cool. It's Ottoman Armenia so it's cold outside and the water's freezing on top of that lake, yaravan is polluted. This reservoir is not a place where most people would willingly swim at all. But the brothers aren't thinking about that. They can see the trolley poles sticking out of the lake so they know where the trolley bus is under water. So they dive down. and they start circling it, looking for some sort of entrance that they can pull people out of, but all the windows and doors and shut none of them are broken. Only seconds have passed since the crash, but already, of course, time is running out. When the brothers come back up for air, Shavarshin starts promo to stay at the surface, while he goes back on air . He figures Kamo will be safer, but he can also call for help if Shavarshin's self gets stuck or runs out of energy and leads to be well-screwed. Then he dies back down to the window. probably us and despite all the silt making the water murky, he somehow manages to find the back window. And when he does, he, quote, brought his legs to his chest and thrust his leg through the window with what he describes as quote a karate. You're imagining in there and  through the silt, sudden issues. Oh, you're not so fucking you. Guy, you want to say, yeah, oh, he's very. Coming to save the day in the water, it's Hi, oh, he's cute. How are you? I'd love to save you in my small bathing suit. I would love that, and my B.C. chess. I can be a B.C. That's the man that's been running around with weights on. Yes, but yeah, save the day. And then that's, I don't think. Superb, what if it's? So it's a hawk I kicking in the window. How is it? Hell yes. So this kick works. He breaks in. He also slices his leg in the sauce. He's just part of it. He is he util socc masses. on his leg, but he's now created a six-foot wide opening in Miss Charlie Bus window, without being able to release sea, he starts feeling around from bodies before pulling someone through the window and then surfacing them. Chavarsh, hands that survivor over to his brother, who now is able to bring them to some first responders who have just rode out on Kaya. Oh, and then Chavarsh immediately heads back now. He moves unbelievably fast for someone who has just run 13. miles with 45 pounds of sand structures back or  not at all. You have your moves grass for a person. This is for one of us. So he swims back down to the opening and grabs another person, brings them up to his brother, goes back down, grabs another and so on. He then realizes he can swim up when he first comes up out of that area, he can swim above the roof and then push off from the roof and basically launch himself up to the surface way fast. So he starts doing it that. He also pulled the glass of that six foot window out by hand. Oh, so he made it so that no one else would. Yeah, hot themselves the way he comes up. So now there's proud gathered to watch this Harry and rescue mission play out. And one of the men in the crowd is Shavarsha's father's lab mirror. It was also coincidentally just in the area when the trolley bus went into the way. He is so stunned to realize that the men in the water are his two sons. He later says, quote, I thought to myself, it's a good thing I made sure they weren't had a swim. Yeah, sorry. I love our new style. But they're so  you can't get them. They don't get riled up. Yeah. They're not extra. No. They're real. He's not  those are my boys. He's not bragging. He's just , wow, thank God. Thank God. You've got this. Some lessons going. Love it. Vladimir, we're later recall how tense and anxious these omeletteers work. Of course, they have no idea who should ours actually is at one point. He doesn't resurface after a minute or two and there is a palpable feeling in the crowd that he might have drowned mid-rescue. Blackenor says quote, when he finally came up, there was a massive communal sigh of ...I know. So down below Shavar's is still moving very fast with no time to be diligent or to think about what he's doing. At one point, he grabs what he thinks is a person but realizes upon surfacing that it's a sea. Oh, it pains him very much and he will. later say quote, that cost one month. Only a few minutes have passed since this bus actually went into the water and Shavars has already pulled dozens of bodies through that one broken window. We don't know the exact number, but it's estimated that he saves around 20 people. One down. Polish 20 people one guy. As more precious seconds pass, Shavars realizes there are no survivors. So in addition to the 20 people he saves, he recovers the bodies. around since teen. He winds down his rescue mission, but he doesn't rest. Cranes have just arrived at Lake Yervon to lift the trolley bus out of the water, basically to get the rest of the bodies out of the water. But the crane operators need to figure out how to rock the cranes' cables around the trolley to get it out. It's a dangerous job, but Shavarshan is brother Kamo does not do it. And also don't anybody else. get in this water. Yeah.  let us let it just be us. Mm. Basically, Shavar has to take a crowbar underwater, break out more windows, and then thread the kegels through those broken windows by swimming through them through the cab of the Charlie bus. Or, or, or, or, or, or, yep. And they kind of can't see. And I'm sure he didn't clear out that broken glass. Right. It's just he's doing himself. And ultimately, he's successful. The cranes are able to lift the Charlie bus from the water. and the rest of the victims' bodies are recovered. When Chvarsha's finally about to get out of the lake, all of this exertion has taken a real toll on him plus the polluted water. His legs start shaking, his vision gets spotty. So his father Vladimir takes him home and urges him the rest. But Chvarsha's condition gets worse. His fever spikes at 104 degrees. He gets the various he starts convulsing. Because he's got that kind of prison that pollution-runner. !! An shiiii ch!! And also just the sheer trauma of what he basically got himself into and then had to continue doing more. That's just him by himself with both survivors but then by us. He's taken to the hospital where he's diagnosed with a severe case of pneumonia. He's pumped to antibiotics and he has to spend the next three weeks and find a hospital bed. Years later, one of Shavarsha's doctors will talk about how close of a call this was. And we'll say... quote, to be honest, I was surprised that we were able to save his life from that infection. It was the healthy system of an athlete that's fought. And after he fought for the lives of others, God now gave him the strength to fight for his pain. So all of this happens, and he goes to the hospital who's basically in the hospital for about a month. And essentially, the people that were there and watched it happen know about it, and so that gets talked about. But most people in Merevon don't know about the and they certainly don't know about Shavarsha's heroic response to it. Although the local government has given him and Kamo 48 rubles, the equivalent of a quarter of the typical monthly wage at the time. And that's all we get. Even though it's an incredible newsworthy story, no outlets pick it up, it seems very intentional because it's basically about a tragic infrastructure failure. And so if you don't want people hearing about that, even the official that documents the Tali bus crash is plus. But Chavar didn't do it for attention or for glory. And actually when he marries his wife, Nelly, later on, he never tells her about it. What? She never tells me. Oh my god. I know. I know. Stop bragging right. You are in there. Chavar feels  he has more pressing concerns. He's supposed to be working on his big comeback for the since winning team. You did it! That was your comeback. I mean, yeah. So just three weeks after leaving the hospital, he goes back to training. So he's in the hospital for almost a month, but it's been a day. Basically takes a month of  getting the strength back and now he's back. He says, of course, well, it was much harder for him at that point. He says, quote, when I started heavy training, I couldn't handle it. Mew kiss was coming out from my lungs. I was passing all the time. The moon, yeah. Last month, a month ago. See you in the down by. Shivarsh also finds himself getting very tense when he has to be in Watmachnip, which is understandable because of the trauma. But he is so eager to prove himself to the Soviet sports officials, he pushes through all of that fear and pain and trauma, and just a few months later in the spring of 1977, he makes it to the Soviet championship games once again. This time in Baku, Azerbaijan. Your favorite country. I love it there. Azerbaijan was the reference country at the first writing job ever had somebody very smart and funny made that reference and then I was just  that's a country So now   you really really know it. I really know it got it. Yeah, but I could I would never reference it because I don't know anything about it And I can't Except for that the 1977 Soviet championship games were there So always know which I will that because I'm big fan of so be a champion Chiewar is up against how our house Soviet swimmers do of his competitors have set world records, but he's here on a mission to prove himself to be the best Finn swimmer in the USSR. And when he hears the starting gunfire, he leaps on the platform, he dives into the water, and as he puts it, quote, I swim to the death. I never raced so angry before. And in this race, the now 24-year-old Shavar sets a new world record. So that's swim angry. That's the way we're learning. My main gribe bee got to do it, get in there and really want it. Later that year at the European Championship Games, Hillwind's four more medals, three silver's in a gold. Almost no one in the crowd has any idea that less than a year before this championship almost died saving the lives of Twemba. It's out until the early 80s when a reporter named Sir Day Leskov, covering a swimming competition in Moscow, here's about champion Armenian since swimmer. once quietly saved 20 people in your home. And when Sergey brings the story back to his editor, he's immediately sent Armenia to get the whole story and cover it off. As Carl Schreck writes in his, I just realized that Carl Schreck's last name is Schreck. He's just realized that? Yeah, I'm just reading it. Is it felt with a sea of people? I've been hearing Schreck. I mean, I'll fill it up. He's just got a very light green complexion. I was thinking, the person was saying, that had sucked out moment. that we can now hide. But she just was , oh no. Oh no, it's me Carl Schreck. Yeah, forever. I'm a swamp troll. Lil you, Mary and me, princess. No sounds good. Carl Schreck, please write in if you're good looking. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Okay, so this writer who wrote the piece for Grant Land, the plunge and Carl Schreck says, quote, it's unclear why local authorities decided to hand over documents about the accident to less cop. After keeping it quiet for so long, perhaps they feared repercussions from Moscow if they stone walled a leading national papers attempt to publish an ideologically sound lineization of a Soviet athlete. So maybe it's  now Shavarish has legitimized himself in the story. He's burned the right to brag about things. Yeah, got it. Yeah. Regardless in October of 1982, the story runs in one Soviet newspaper under the headline, quote, a champions underwater. bottle. Mind you, it implies that Chavarsh saved everyone on the trolley bus, which, when we've got happens in stories  that, and it also does not list the names of the victims, but this amazing Armenian hero is finally getting his long overdue recognition. So words spreads throughout the USSR, and one year later in 1983, the most prominent newspaper in the Soviet Union picks up the story, and spotlights Chavarsh in a lengthy article. It has a very- wide reach and for many of the people Shavars has saved this is first time they've ever learned his name. Because  it all went under wraps. So they were  a guy got me out all these of the guy I know. We don't know who he is and they find out not only he's him but he's  this gold metal winning swim totally. This is also the first time Shavars' wife, Nelly, learns about her has been saving 20th hi honey! How do you get one? I read the newspaper then. Is there something that you've been meaning to  tell me Whatever you need whatever you need or want Me or not do it because you're so hot never speaks me again So cigarettes in the pavilion parking lot all day long out here In fact just come home Nelly about a month after So no, I'm just about a month after that article runs The USSR awards Shavarche the first of many metals recognizing his courage and over time he becomes a verifiable legend across the region. Finally, the press allows him or the, , the powers that be allowed him to get the credit that he so rightly deserves, but he's not going to stop there. Because 10 years after the Charlie Bus accident in 1985, a fire breaks out at a year of arena and Subarth verse into the burning building, shoulder to shoulder with the fire side is helping to look for survivors. Is he in the speeder? I mean, he's got one fan on his back. I don't know much more about the details of that scenario. You just know that he went in, he suffers burns in the process. But afterwards, he will nonchalantly say, quote, anyone can find himself in a place where somebody needs help. And more than once, too, the main. something is to remember what makes you seem. He's , I'm fine with whatever kinds of rescues I have to do. So, our should become such an important cultural figure that during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, he was asked to carry the Olympic torch into the Premier. And you might remember him doing it because on his last leg of the journey, the flametkept going out while he was running. And at one point he actually stopped and asked to secure. to really light it with the zipper. That's our boy. I can get things done. He's , what's going on? But also, I kind of remember that guy and being , everybody else was looked  a run, look  whatever, and Shavarsh looks , it's just a regular Armenian guy that you would see around. I have a memory of, we'll look  an older guy running, at that point he's probably... to 60's. So today Shivar is around 70 years old.
