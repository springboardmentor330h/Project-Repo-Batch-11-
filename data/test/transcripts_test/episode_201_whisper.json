Buffalo, jeez, Michael Stars, Kate's VIII, Perseus VIII, Pantsle Vags. Go there, the kids are out of Tommy, you'll see. I have to go to the Grosiglundburg North, we'll have Kate's VIII or Prada Handbag. So I go, top-off, just a few minutes across the Chicago suburbs. That tradition I at this point in any story on public radio, or any of you special. which happened next is that I should arrive to Lindbrok North and find out that no of course kids in both schools are the same kids or kids they're always the same but it turns out that there are a lot of kids at Lindbrok North GPN who agree that they are a snobbyer. GPN is more  you have to have this and do you hear into your makeup everything? I think GBS is more comfortable with themselves as people but we are. Exactly. And if you're not. in the end crowd, then it's , , I think and everyone will think of you as just the loser and  it's hard. I was told that that most of the girls at this school would be carrying either Kate's fate or Prada bags. I have a Prada on right now, actually. Yeah, it's too. It's true. That's true. But , laying it all out  this here on the radio, exaggerates just how competitive to others are. Musket didn't seem to care a lot. one way or the other about the subject. It was the kids who were the most invested in the idea of school spirit, and they were the strongest and there's a difference in schools. that first go, we'll let you blunt first. Yeah, I have a lot of spirit, so I'm on com, which is  dancing at the halftime show. So I guess I'm a little, hi, spirit. What can I say? Yeah. It's hard for there to be such a thing as us if you don't have a them. And some people by disposition need a good them. Other people tend to see them, but it's all sorts, it's more , ah. which is the subject of today's radio show. In this time of war when we are off doing a heightened sense of us and them, we wanted to take up the problem of them with three stories of people misperceiving the deminus of them. For WBZ Chicago, it's this American life, distributed by public radio and international America glass, a program today in three vivid acts, act one, my friend the extremist. But that means if you're not sleeping with the enemy but instead find that you are watching the lion king with him. Act two. Don't they know it's Christmas after all? In that active, it's a terrorist tries to contemplate the barrenness of a world that has Santa, but no elves, a three new peas. This door of an American seller in World War II, whose life was saved by foreigners, and then threatened repeatedly by Americans. Us a name reverse. Stay tuned. Hi, one. My friend, the extremist. Several years ago, before many of us paid much attention to the name of Sam up in Lodden, a quarter of John Ronson started following around the witch's leader, who caused himself, in Lodden's manning London. At first Ronson definitely thought that this leader was on the Thameside of us in them. Once Ronson got to know him, he changed that opinion. In the years since the 10th of November, he has been forced to change that opinion again, to the point where it is not exactly clear what you think. New start. At first met Omar Bakri Mahamid shortly after he declared holy war. of Britain in 1995. There were maybe 5,000 of Oma Baku's followers in Shafalga Square when he announced that he wouldn't rest until he saw the black flag of Islam flying over the downing streets and the White House. There was much cheer in. The stage had been rented out to him by the local city council for which the outline his post G had vision for the UK. He who practiced homosexuality, adultery, would be stone to death or thones in the highest mountain. Christmas decorations and shop window dummies would be outlawed. Hubs would be closed down. Pictures of ladies legs of packets of pantyhose would be banned. Would still be able to buy pantyhose, would there be advertise simply with the word, pantyhose. I've made much want to. The tomato mababha-ree can spend time with him or he attempted to overthrow democracy and shaps form Britain into an Islamic nation. It turned out that he lived a couple of miles away from me, an Edmonton north London, in a small, semi-detached house at the end of a cold-assack. I got his telephone number from the phone book. He called back straight away. There were so many anti-Muslim lies he said generated by the Jewish controlled media, so much misinformation in the newspapers and the movies. Perhaps this would be an opportunity for the record to be set straight. So yes, I was welcome to join him in his struggle against the infidel's. And then he added, I'm actually very nice, . Are you? I asked, oh yes, to the home of that great. I am delightful. I've been here for nine the next morning. I sat in Omar's living room for Omar played with his... baby daughter. What she daughters name I asked him. It is a difficult name for you to understand Sadoma. Does it have an English translation I asked? Oh yes, Sadoma. It translates into English as the black flag of Islam. Really, I said, your daughter's name is the black flag of Islam. Yes, Sadoma. Really, I said. There was a small cause. You see, Sadoma, why are conscious. into great. The Lion King is playing on the video. We watch the scene where the Warthok's son Hakuna Matata, the son about how wonderful it is to have no worries and problem-free philosophies. Omar sang along bouncing the baby on his knee. We always watch the Lion King, he said. It's the only way I can relax,  they call me the Lion, that's right, they call me the Lion, they call me the Great Warrior, the Great Fighter. his T-nage photographs made him look  a matinee idea. He came from a family of 28 brothers and sisters, his father had made fortune selling sheep and pigs and cows. They had chauffeurs and servants and palaces and cereal and turkey and they root. Omar escaped Saudi Arabia in 1985. He told him he was going to be arrested for preaching the G had he escaped to Britain. Now he's a big man with a big beard. I was thin because that always worried he said, and was always on the run. Now I live in prison, I never worry. What's going to happen to be here? Ha ha! So I got fat. A leader must be big in stature. The bigger the body, the bigger the leader. Who wants a little scrawny leader? Omer's plan for the morning is to hand out leaflets he titled, homosexuality, lesbianism, adultery, and a public station and festiallity. The deadly diseases. He said he couldn't help noticing my car in the driveway, so perhaps I would give him a lift. Okay, I said, I dropped him off near the tube station. I went to park the car. Ten minutes later, I found him standing in the middle of the pavement with a stack of leaflets in his hands. How is it going, Oma? I asked. Oh, very good, he smiled. The message is getting across the area some deadly diseases here and there. He turned to the past as fine. Homosexuality, the old, beware the deadly disease, beware the hour. Subtime passed. Homosexuality, the oldoma. Beware, there are homosexuals everywhere. I expected season hostility to homosexuality from the passes by, but the shoppers and tourists and office workers seem to regard him with a kindly amusement. Nonetheless, after ten minutes, nobody had actually taken a leaflets. Beware the hour, there are homosexuals. sexual's everywhere beware the hour. Continue Domeach, dear fellow. Be careful from homosexuality. It is not good for your tummy. Oma Baku was unlike my image from the Muslim extremist. Then he told me he had a good idea. Just watch this he said. He turned the leaflets upside down. Help the orphans, the yellows. Help the orphans. Oma likes legs and lies. The passes by start to accept leaflets. This is good, chuckle Domeach. This is good, you see? If I wasn't a Muslim, I'd be working for how he's saying, Sachi and Sachi. At lunchtime, Omar sat in a debates and collection boxes for his regular fundraiser in Debis, Hamas and Hezbollah. Hamas had orchestrated a bus bombing in Jerusalem three weeks earlier, which had killed 11 people. There was a cash and code just off the ring road near Tottenham , said Omar, that sells fake. good collection boxes. Could you give me a lift? Okay, I said. So we drove to the Cashon Carried. Oma sat in the back seat, which made me feel a little  a taxi driver. Left said Oma, left at the junction. No left. At some traffic lights I asked Oma where his wife was when I was at his house. She was upstairs. He sat. She wouldn't. come down until after you left. What would happen if I tried to interview her, I asked. I would declare fat while on you said, Omar. Please don't say that I said. Ha ha, said Omar. Even as a joke I said. We arrived at the Cacheon Carrier to discover that the only collection boxes they had in stock were large plastic novelty Coca-Cola bottles. caused for a moment. He scrutinized the collection boxes. He furrowed his brow. Then he placed half a dozen of them in his shopping cart. These are good collection boxes he said. Very big and lightweight. It seemed strange to me I said that you planned to collect for Hamas in knockout to Coca-Cola bottles. Ah, said oh my battery. I am not against the imperialist baggage. Just the corruption of Western civilization. We packed our stuff into the trunk of my car and I drove Omar to the Finnsby Park mosque where he was to deliver a speech that he conflicts in the title, democracy or dictatorship. Omar was speaking on behalf of dictatorship. This is my first opportunity to meet some of Omar's followers. There were 35 голосed crimin redist strings except not staff very happy. Are you a Jew? Ask the young man. Err... No. I lied. The apologised. Ah, don't worry about it. I said. Oma Baku was fast talking on the podium. As if he couldn't contain the words that needed to be said, he filled the room. He quoted from a letter he just received from an old friend, Shake Oma up. to Rakhman, the blind shape. The blind shape was in Jay of the life in Missouri, through the inspiring, the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. This law of inspiration that not been utilized, should be the American Civil War. Omar used to eat with the blind shape back in Saudi Arabia. After the speech Omar said he needed to do some errands in town and could I give you . I agreed, or the way, fear'd I was beginning to cross the line between journalists and show fur. I'm meeting someone in Soho, I said, so, can I drop you up there? No, no, he said, actually, it is forbidden for me to go into Soho. Please don't take me there. Soho would be raised to the ground, said Oma. What's the holy war that'd been won? It is important for people to understand these things he said, so they would be ready to adapt to the new ways. Have you ever been to Soho, I asked? Oh no, said Ohma, it is forbidden. What do you imagine Soho to be , I asked? There were naked women everywhere, he said. Naked women standing on street corners. We've got talking about the word fundamentalist. Ohma said it had been redefined by the infidel's, the West, as a projotive term. You used as an insult, Omar said, to left please. But surely you are a fundamentalist I said, in the sense that you live your life by the rules set down in the Quran. This is true, Omar, the Quran rules every aspect of my life. Tells him how I eat, how I sleep, how I fight, and even how I will die. Omar paused. He know he said, the Quran even tells me which direction I must break wounded. This is a sure silence. And which direction do you break when did I ask? In the direction of the non-believer, Oma said, the direction of the non-believer, Oma laughed heartily for some time, and he slapped me on the back. Okay, said Oma, as I called up in the Picadini surface, thank you very much, goodbye John. As I drove away, I gave my horn in this repeat, and I mow the words, how cruel. As the months progressed I found my life becoming increasingly determined by Omar's wins. If you turn up late, he often said, I will give you 60 lashes. How hard? For many occasions Omar would telephone and call me over urgently. I've cancelled nights out with my wife and drive over to discover that he'd got them all about me and are taking the train to Klymouth or Narnitun, which he has secret to get an energy cut to feed him. As sometimes felt I was getting unique insight into what it would be  living under his land-rule with Omar as Ayatollah. Time passed and then it was January, the first day of Ramadan. For months now I've been asked him Omar to take me to his secret G-hat training camp in Clawley, an anonymous commuter town near Gapwak airport, would seem to rather incongruous location for a G-hat training camp. Finally here great. We were picked up at Crawley Station by some young local followers. These were people I've never seen before. Oma said that an every town in city and country and many towns abroad, there were cluster of these supporters. When you put those people together, said Oma, you have an army. Oh yes, he continued. There's a day when military struggle will take place in the UK. G-hat is called Hulqueray. One day without question the UK. Hey, it's going to be governed by Islam. The Muslims in Britain must not be known. They must be ready to defend themselves militarily. The struggle as I always say is a struggle between two civilizations. The civilization of man against the civilization of God. We were driven to the G.H. training camp, a well-stocked, gymnast scout us in a policy centre. Snowlay on the grounds. Inside a young man wearing boxing gloves was beating a punch bag and Oma immediately instructed him to focus his assault. On the head he said, that's it's the head. Easy, easy, okay stop now. Rest, rest, you kill him, you kill him. The group laughed and I laughed too. I was standing in one corner with my back against the wall. I found the situation slightly uncomfortable, and then, a proper power of nothing, Oma made an announcement to the group. Let's go! Look at me, he said, here I am with an infidel, John, and my pause through effect. Is a Jew, there was an audible gas followed by a long silence. Of all the locations in which Oma could have chosen to disclose the sensational revelation, the pact G had training camp in the middle of a forest is not the place that had hoped for. I found myself searching for the fastest pact to the door. Are you really a Jew, said someone eventually? Well, I said lightly, surely it's better to be a Jew than an atheist. There was silence. No it isn't, said a voicemail ground. When did  I was Jewish, I asked Oma. From the beginning he said, I could see it in your eyes, why didn't you tell me? Well, I said, , you ashamed to be a Jew, said Oma, you deny it? No, I said. I am not offended that you were a Jew, Sadoma, we are all sea mints. If you were this Rayleigh, if you were Zionist, that is a different matter, but what effemes me is that you hide it, you were similate, that you have no pride. I am proud, I said, unconvencelling. But of course, Oma was right, I should have told him. A simulation, Tadadoma, integration. These are the worst things of all. In the years that followed my time with Omar he sporadically made the papers, calling for this Fatwa, what that Fatwa reaffirming the Fatwa on Salman Rushdie after Iran had lifted it. But he also began to seem increasingly anachronistic, a spent force. All that would change during the week of September 11, 2001. The first sign that Omar had decided to initiate his own endgame, him in the form of press released he posted on his website on September 12. It read, The Final Hour will not come until the Muslims conquer the White House, as America declares war at 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, what is your duty? Omar then gave a series of newspaper interviews in which he spoke of his delight in attacks. Oh wow, we told the Daily Mail, the United States has come under attack, it's exciting. A number of his- British followers joined the Taliban, at least three were, in Oma's words, marted, because of it. The conservative leader, during an emergency session of parliament, called for a change in the laws of Oma could be deported, Scotland Yard arrested Oma, and then they released him, he committed no crime. A telephone doma, on the evening of his arrest, I expected to find him in defiant mood, but he seemed a little scared. terrible he said, but please say they made deport me, why are people linking me with them laden? I do not know the man, I've never met him, why do people say I've been laden's man in great Britain? Because you've been calling yourself been laden's man in great Britain figures, I said. Oh John said, Oma, I need you more than ever now,  I'm harmless don't you? You always said I was laughable didn't you? Oh John, why don't people believe you when you tell them I'm just a harmless clown. Of course, someone who's a clown isn't always harmless. I thought about Omar when I watched the World Trade Center fall to the ground. Had he been a monster all this time, masquerading as a friendly perfume to fool Gileless liberals and me? I wanted to feed you to me or worse, if I'd shoot to myself. Someone once told me that I suffered from the great liberal misconception, and that everyone is basic. good underneath. I'd argue instead that most people are mixed with good and bad, and to see ourselves and them is better, and seeing them as inhuman is something that is impossible to recognize. But I have to admit there are moments where I think I went too far in the friend in Oma. For the last time I saw him in person, was 1996. It had been a year since he bought his novelty Coca-Cola. Hamas Collection boxes from the Cashon Carried. They were formal and loose change in 50 pound notes. There was a check for £5,000 in one. Oma and his deputy Anjem were taking the Collection boxes to the bank. The money would be converted into foreign currency and shipped off to the Middle East, who had been used in the fight against Israel. Oma had some business to finish. Anjem packed the bottles in the back of his car, then he remembered that he'd left his coat inside. He said, could you guard the money for a moment? I won't be long. OK, I said. I'm Jim Disappeared. And I was left standing guard of thousands of pounds. Money that could go to Hamas to kill the Jews at Israel. For a while I stood there. And what was I doing? Guarding money that we could use to kill the Jews. And then I understood that I had to take the money. I had to reach into the car. Grab the Coca-Cola bottles and make a run for it. My name is James Sarkhan from The Hands Church. Lovers in residence, murder in social property, which may find a crime in prison or it mayAKI prison. Baratino and Eddie too, percented a murderer. So details can be found right through the room. In the interviews, I said for a moose as business gw who is the servant who will marry to the crime, he is tradition of a kid. This was my responsibility, my duty, had an obligation to do this. I had the strength to carry two bottles. How many lives back that safe? Oh, my an amgema inside? The cow was unlocked. But I didn't do it, of course. I just stood there. And then I'm Gem and Oma returned. Facts me for my help. Took the money to the bank. Janatam. And in theỏ of forecast, we've caught on the 2nd-C��. Lockery left London and then was banned from returning into England. , listen, we have a nun. Coming up, David Cedaris puts the dam back in Amsterdam. Can you say that on the radio, right? That's in a minute. I'm Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues. It's a American life when the glass is going to program of course, which use some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories and today's program. So as of how we sometimes expect. them to be more  us or less  us other times and wrong. We've arrived at Act 2 of our program Act 2, don't they know it's Christmas after a long time? When we try to overseas, most of us want to embrace the deminess of other countries and cultures. But that can be hard when we can find ourselves to museums, shopping, restaurants. David said, there are some advice if you think to talk about what overseas, to get a glimpse of the ways in which people are different from us. I've never been much regard for, so in traffic. I'm doubling abroad, my first question usually relates to Bagnar and Anniversary. What do your rooster say is a good icebreaker? As every country has its own unique interpretation. Breach and rooster's pro, Kiddie Aki, and in France they screen Hoko Rico, which sounds an order for one of those horrible pre-mixed cocktails with a pirate on the label. But told that an American rooster says, cock and doodle do. My host. to look at me with this belief and pity. When do you open your Christmas present since another good question? This I think it explains a lot about National Character. In France and Germany, you have surfed change on Christmas Eve, while in Holland, the children hope in their present on December 6th, which is nationally celebrated as Saint Nicholas Day. It sounded sort of white until I spoke to a man named Oscar who filled me in a few of the details as we watch from my. hotel for the Amsterdam train station. Unlike the Jolly obese America's centre, St. Nicholas's painfully thin and dresses not unlike the Pope, topping his ropes with a tall hat resembling an embroidered T-cozy. The outfit I was told is a carryover from his former career when he served as the fish of Turkey. I'm sorry, I said, how could you repeat that? One does it want to be too much of a cultural showmanist but this seems completely wrong to me. For starters, Santa didn't use to do anything. He's not retired, and more importantly, he has nothing to do with Turkey. It's too dangerous there, and the people wouldn't appreciate him. When asked how he got from Turkey to the North Pole, Oscar told me with complete conviction that St. Nicholas currently resides in Spain, which again. and is simply not true. While our Santa flies in on a sled, the Dutch version arrives by boat and then transfers to a white horse. The Atlantis televised and great crowds gather at the waterfront to greet her. I'm not sure if there's a set date, but he generally knocks and late November and spends a few weeks hanging out and asking people what they want. As it just came alone, I asked, where does he come with some back-off? I asked! English was closed perfectly. But he seemed thrown by a term normally reserved police reinforcement. Helper, as I said, does he have any else? Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but I couldn't help but feel personally insulted when Oscar denounced the very idea as, quote, rotests. And unrealistic. Helps he said, they're just so silly. The word silly and unrealistic were redefined when I learned that St. Nicholas travels with what was consistently described as six to eight black men. I asked several Dutch people to narrow it down but none of them could give me an exact number. It was only six to eight which seemed strange considering they've had hundreds of years to get a decent headcount. The six to eight black men were characterized as personal. slaves into the mid-1950s when the political climate changed and it was decided that instead of being slaves they were just good friends. I think history is proven that something usually comes between slavery and friendship. A period of time marked not by cookies and quiet hours beside the fire, but by bloodshed in mutual hostility. They have such violence in Holland, but rather than duking it out amongst one another, Vicente and Reformers study again. decided to take it out in the public. And the early years of the child was naughty, St. Nicholas in the 6th day, black men, would beat him with what Oscar described as the small branch of a tree. Then if the youngster was really bad, they'd put him in a sack and taken back to Spain. Wait a minute. St. Nicholas would kick you. Well, not anymore, Oscar said. Now we just remain. to get you. He considered this to be progressive but in a way I think it's almost more perverse in the original punishment. I'm going to hurt you but not really. While late flying reindeer are a hard pill to swallow, our Christmas story remained relatively dull. Santa lives with his wife in a remote polar village spends one night a year traveling around the world. If you're bad, you need to call. you're good in live in America. Forgive you just about anything you want. We tell our children to be good and send them off the bed where they lie awake and anticipating their great bounty. I got your parent has a decidedly past year story to relate. Telling his children, list, you might want to pack a few of your things together before. The former Bishop of Turkey will be coming from it. Along with six to eight black men, they might put some candy in your shoes, they might stuff you into a sack and take it to Spain or they might just pretend to kick you. We don't know for sure, but we want you to be prepared. This is a reward for living in Holland. As a child, you get to hear this story, and as a adult, you get to turn around and repeat it. A genetic bonus at government hystronium legalized drugs and prostitution. So what's not to love about being Dutch? Welcome Waners ceramic, a new sponsor that continues to seal the Clinton books is when appears in dress your children in court or write in denim, which brings us to act three new fees. We end up with this story in which us and them are reversed. All of people who should be on the side of the man in the story are actually against him. And all the foreigners who might be bad to him actually treated him  one of the rock. Chris broke the story together. I'm driving to the small town as it lords and you can land Canada. It's about 300 miles from where I live myself, and the population is 1600 and 97, called Road Sonic. It's on the edge of a boat of rock that sticks right out into the North Atlantic shipping lanes. When you see this place on the map, it looks  a big foot, waiting to trip on wary savers. The person giving me directions here is Ena Edwards, which is kind of the unofficial St. Lawrence's door. It's kind of  a devil stop. You see the highest doors on there. Newfoundland is a place that some mainland can be used  to make jokes about. They imagine that we're in Island of some kind of naïve fisher folk. And actually naïve isn't the right word. Stupid is what they think we are. And the jokes they tell about are they call new videos. how many of us does it take to screw you in a line while that kind of thing. And when I first heard this story, it was in that kind of a context. Funny story. isolated new from landers just too naive to know what would have been obvious to most other people in North America. But later, I found out the rest of the story. And it wasn't a joke at all. Where Ines taking his place to the new school playground, but the playground is really the end of the story. The beginning of it is 3000 miles south of here, all of a sudden, the cat town is short. If you're stepping real, show you that St. Lawrence at photograph. Yeah, that's St. Lawrence. And this is my grandma, great grandmother, and Grandfather, who won slaves. Well, I'm the near-filots. It's born one. March 14, 1923. And I live in the Cap County. And the Cap County had been funny students with black people until 1939. They didn't want the blacks to have any kind of education. Then they had the plans, the good-class plans. They instill fear in the black people that recently tried. I know they had. to be in to me from five to six years old. And I would go up the railroad track and see them come down mainstream, march it, every Saturday night, they would march, and then at other times they would be on this truck, and they would fly a shot in the air, something  that. And I knew which way they were going. They kept in their cars, the railroad track, if they kept going straight, and knew they was going to a place called Smoke Roll Predominator. It's , well, it was all right. But if they made a right turn, and knew they was coming down with what we call Bruce's Alley. We had a living, I take off  a jack rabbit and tell people they are coming and everybody would put the glam something but didn't have electricity, but they did some turbo things. a gig at a while, had a chance to build the slew themselves. They call yellow rib. Three counties, rockdale, winded counties, and the cab tower got together and build the slew. But the cool-clet's plan during the school done. ? Yes, they'd bring her and remember that clear I can close my eyes and see the flames going stand and watch the slew burn listen to the wrong notes. I'm gonna say, , never let us see them, let our children learn to read. I, I, I saw no future. I had no dreams because all of a thing I could say well maybe I'll be a share popper or something, , once I grew up. So I see. I think I'll join them, they may. So in falling, . actually on the lead. Well, they had blessing one face. Whites and a love. It's a nice, but not, , interfere, go down to the whites. You do a shower. Bathroom or anything  that. And the blacks own board shift. They could only be messetons. Serving and taking what they call taking care of your officer. You were assigned certain amount of office. You kept a shoe shine. This clothing, , ready. and this road came and you'd be out for 30 days of the road, you had to wash those offices underway. Well, in the kind noise we had a lot of magic shifts and you asked for them up to ice, then the British would take over the kind of road and take them on them to the end and homeport is lost in the season. We left Boston, they were strong and we joined up of our house office. That thought we didn't have an ice. See, I wouldn't get off the ship until we get back to the States, , because the previous trip had been to Iceland and no Blacks could know what's sure there because they had some agreement with America that they would never let a Black man put foot in the ice. And they had the same agreement in Morocco of Wales. had a base there and they said no Jew could have him, , stand there and that was a dream and that's the way it was. That's the way it was. Main name was Farrell, which I kept after I married John Ena, Farrell Edwards. And at the time of the disaster in 1942, ever the... 18, and sent Lawrence, great-bye, as Ashwinst, and the approaches to our New York Blizzard. I heard the exiled executive also tell the capies that this is going to be a rough. I'm Gus Hitchigari. I was 16 and a half in 1942, just finished high school in some rounds. I was a huge hit with the hell I was gone. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. and all that the yesterday's rooms would be, but it had the full stripes of the Atlantis. And I guess many people said maybe we'd even said in our house, long death from light, and we could have poor sailors on the sea tonight. Shucks and had more radar. So what they did was relying on dead wrecking. Before they knew it, he arranged the same thing. I thought we'd been torpedoed, I didn't know what. I was in my bed when it hit. Now when I came ahead of all my clothes on the head and my life jacket, and I grabbed a pair of shoes, that hill of this mine, and what top side was down. And it was storming. I mean, it was picking the trucks to up, and the blackness slamming against the rock. And he could be a bit steel blind. Then when they began to break, all you could see was a pefcin' of rocks. And they just picked the shit up and down it with gold. And again, the wash, the fellas all the both, almost got washed over to a tree turn to that grab that life line. And hold on. Add about 730 in the morning. My father called and, , somewhat frantic voice, said, get down here as quickly as you can, get a hold of the driver that picked up the load of all the ropes, lines that you could find in the area, and get down to Chambers' Cole.

All these people, hey, hon, you  to their life on the rail. Some were just swept up on those jagged fifths, and then you, . Tom Bavans on this is a pretty dreadful sight. About this time she began to break and all the oil him come out all of this coming out. And everybody looked  a little rags in the water, covered with that crude oil. I, along with others, went down hand over hand out of rope. I told the other blocks that were standing there with me. I said, please, we've got a knife, we still own what's here. Let's both both, , you say, well, this is Iceland, you don't know what they're going to do. So remember, we just lap Iceland, and it's a little black-side line. Oh, quite safe. Just  me, and enjoy a Mississippi. Do you mean  yours? Sorry, it's kind of a... It's , yes, you're in a liking situation. Yes. On the deck of a... Getting a parking washed off, that's right. It's striking out of a district. Yeah, I'm just... Four-five black guys, having a discussion about... Yes. Whether they should actually swim for it or not, because they might not be allowed in the life. They will stay on board, shoot, or other than take a chance. They're landing in Iceland. I said,  we're gonna die. I said we stay on board with shit. I said, at least we can die fighting. I said let's go. When I jumped in there, I was , I felt  I was going to die. I felt. Just one quick painting  that went over my entire body with all of that and feel any pain after that. I just felt sleep And we got a shoulder So well I made it here. It was very dark So I just Wait now, may only be as close my eyes to that since then and This fellow came and he said, get him up. Don't let him lie there. Say pick him up. Say you surely die. He's there. Say walk him around. So get over him. And he had on the cat. He wasn't made. And he began to walk me around. And there, walk light. And there's light person. , if I had it. Then in Georgia, it's kicking out on the way, ? Let's have these white people. Then I think I passed on. They took them to the U.S. with the rigid temporary first stage station, directed, and who first to call came to the women. Our women are the place to grow to clean the moon. That's where the story came in a little an air, now the little fun is story. See, he was there among all the other devils. The ladies were cleaning them up and scrubbing them up. Did he just do a cover with tar? With this old stop to screw down. There was so filthy they had to have every garden then we were. So when he opened his eyes. See these nightmares. All around there was. stop naked on this table and I heard one of the ladies say this is the curl is half ever seen. This is the end of me. Let's get him out of here. He's black, . Then she says, this poor fellow, the terrible right into this poor scrubbing and scrubbing and our hands get him things. , I spoke up. She said, carry me out someone, you can't get it off. It's the color of the skin. And she said, oh, I'm going to the hall, right? And so, if you continue to scrub, Violet Pike, which is dead now, see I had never seen a black man before. So, I mean, she didn't differ in her age. She's out there, stop, he was a white man. We put the black into it for us, and she couldn't. She couldn't get it out. And I was thinking, oh, let's go. because that's me, here I am, five minutes in Georgia, it would have ran those white women out of town, and maybe it meant to be for less than babies, . And of course, when the men were taken up to different homes, she said, bring him to my home. So that evening, then, she prepared supper. He was amazed, he put the family. And he drank the Nutana cups to save his tooth as the family. And he took me in the bed and this lady she would come in and say, you go on your own right. And she did this to remain at the night. I didn't go to sleep at the moment, that's I'm still free. I didn't know where I was and what was going to happen to me. But then I kept passing my sad. I was tired. ? They have him in. What's going on? Probably picture so. After all these years. Yeah, sure, sure. And there he is. He's here, sure. See? The next morning, the day no cold on the camp. And I put these things on and I wanted to get outside. what was going on and I went outside and I noticed I was taking pictures and I seen him and I said, well over and get into picture. I said, I'm blinded. , black is on the way here taking a picture with a virus because how many logs you could lift you more for the saw meal? How many pounds of cotton you could pick in a day or something  that? You can see white man's eyes really good. something  that. She's a guy and you get him in, , get your picture taken. I see him. There. They should run to the ground. Four white faces in one black. The story I heard was a joke about the Newfoundlander of Subtry to scrub the black off of black man. This is  a picture of joke. But it turns out the real story doesn't stop here. Well, it has something to do with the daypans. Since that happened it hasn't been on day pass that didn't end up as safe They think they change my entire class here So they gave me leave I think I got 15 days leave And I want to see my aunt living in China, maybe and we will test the bus to go into town and the blacks had to sit behind the whites. And what the whites would do if it was only three points on the bus maybe two of them would go to the seat just before the last seat. Which means that on the way in if the bus broke, they tried to have planet seats. And the blacks would only have that one seat. So we will go on. , I'm not. The back seat was safe and here was the swipe down. So we sat in seat and perfectly. He reached and grabbed me by the neck and pushed me up. He's the nigga don't you sit in front of me in my house. I got in sight after fighting man because it's treatment I got in the same class and what the people have treated me  a boom and  I'm a human. I don't know. longer slave and the lowest least last I say. I'm going to do it. I say if I can give my life fight this floor the same as everybody else can't even ride a bus from that paid the same fairs if not else but I can't be seated at the one path. I'm other of my eyes to speak quiet on skipping lesson we have been listening about that. Two years after she threatened. They sent me to Jacksonville for her. And when I got to Jacksonville, I was hungry. And when I got off and walked into the station, I saw all these prisoners. Italian and German prisoners in the head, and I saw them in the head and inside the dining room. And I knew that the blinds could go to a window, something something, but I knew that it wouldn't be allowed to go into that night. And I thought about the people saying, I'm sorry, fed me, gave me clothing, put me in there. And I looked at the persons and he, I am American music. So I went in to ask, where does the color you sweat they call? back in the color. Negals, , get something to eat, trying to make it to the naval ostrich. So I'll let the go-man miss one cup, grab me by the color and slung me on the ground. And when you slung me on the ground, you put this foot right on my neck and actually pull his gun out and pull him a hammer back and he hit play. I thought he's going to shoot. He say all have done me a good job. you're right, right into that. He said,  that it would come in here where these white people are. So the white people were the German presidents in the Italian president. And here I am in American New York. Number two, so acoustic. 16 years after the shipwreck. of shining shoes. I was tired of washing dishes, hot sea hundreds. I was tired of 17 years, and then maybe there's a message that was looking to do not get out. I wonder, learn a tree and I wrote the first black Congress wrote the Bureau of Naval Personnel or that thought I was caught by it. It was something of a necessity. And when I got that letter by sin, report to three solar school, I really gave the credit to Saint Lange because had it not been for Saint Lange, I would have been writing the powers to be because I had been brainwashed and I was so inferior to the white man and said don't look forward to ever do anything and I at orders report the feet on the school. They call me household must see you. And I went and received a house that envelopes there. They got good news. So, on the side class, he's a known contact Washington and they go along with it and make you the chief student. Message. He's saved a class. We don't think you can make it too so. We'll see. it... and take the first class if you move. I say, but just don't show me the food. He said, well,  you're going to fuck out, don't you? I say, no, I don't know that. I said give me a chance if I come down so be it. He's all right, you start the next class. So I start the next class and I want to show you some of that food. your It's forward right there, look. By now you've probably forgotten how we started the story. Driving around some arms, 59 years after the shipwreck, with a town historian in the Embers, looking for the brand new school playground. So there's the paper out. The established building to marry an element of this movement, 99. You're not entering the room. I'm not a rich man. But, every contribution. I can make it to the people of St. Marge. I realize since the marge flows, the kind of this is way down. He has shown gratitude,  that, but, and the time gets end new playground for the element of school. And there's about, I have nice check that present in the main air. I've said, do whatever this society wants to do with this. I see, but I don't YouTube. , do something for you, New Zingham, and let the world know what she did for the entire crew of the trucks. And here's this black man. Let them know what she did for them too, and how many chains did they go? When Eric fell up, U.S. his trucks and survived her. Then on the other side, the U.S. his trucks in last February 18, 1942. And the Marion Elementary. School logo is in the center. The name, the playgrounds, the linear telephoto playground. I see no recognition. I just want the people of Saint Lawrence to know how much I appreciate. And I want them to know what they did. But do you think they're a different kind of people from the people in Georgia? Well, they are the same kind of people, but the reason they are different is because they're different is because their parents, grandparents, or what didn't teach them in the history, in the bigotry that the Southern United States taught there, in the crisis of what we've been taught. And the people of St. Lawrence taught me that I was a human beef, they put into my mouth, it's actually, it's soft,  liquid steel. So, hot steel became cold, solid. It's in, level.
