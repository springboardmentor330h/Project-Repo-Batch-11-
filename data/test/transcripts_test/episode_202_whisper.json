They don't have to listen once the problem is not an assignment. I read the greatest quote that we don't have to get into now, but I get... about comments online. It's quite long so I'm not gonna bore you but it's so good. This book is really, really, really, I know Sally and every internet search last year and I didn't read that. Really, really good. And she has this other one called Beautiful World where are you came out  three or four years ago. She's quoted me and the fuck is up about. Can I read it? Yeah. I mean, we can also cut it. If you're listening, things she's done. I don't think it's done. I don't think it's done. It's great. Yeah. We went to my amherst. She's there? No, she's there. about six or five liters of water if you put it in a tank. I got it right. Honestly, your references are all  old indoor about the liquid. It's just fucking wild out there. I'm so pissed. Yes, so much. Yeah, I'll see you go chill. I'll see you go chill. I'll see you go chill. I'll see you go chill. I'll see you. I'll see you. I'll see you. I'll see you. This is what I'm talking about. Yeah, I'll see you. I'll see you. I'll see you. I'll see you. This is more useful land. Oh, but fast. , I'm not a man. I'm not a man. Nobody's going to go home. She's the new. She's the new. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, you were going to be one of some of my stories. Yeah. Closet. Yeah. We got fruit nine. So this one was this book that was written in the news. Two of us, we were just going to write her and she's writing her. And she's just going to interview a better new book. She says, I don't know if you've been following any of this, but about Martha goes to interview over email and journalists ask me what my partner taught in my books. I'm thinking really I wrote back that you never read them. So of course, this became the headline of the interview. Alice Kelly Hare, my boyfriend, is never read my books. In afterwards, Felix, a boyfriend, saw a popular tweet saying something , this is tragic, she deserves better. Show me the tweet on the screen of the phone on evening of that incident and anyone has what he thought about. He's shocked at it. For example, Verschalo's self-aggressors for a book culture. There are not readers who are shunned as morally inferior, and the more books are read, the better you are than everyone else, but then I thought no. But we really have here an example of a presumably normal and sane person who's thinking has been drained by the concept of celebrity. An example of someone who genuinely believes that because she is see-my photographic red-by-now-host, she goes me personally, and it's fact knows better than I do what is best for her life, and it's normal. It's normal for her not only to take least bizarre thoughts privately, but to express them in public. We're seeing positive feedback in it. attention as result. She has no idea that she is in this small limited respect quite literally insane because everyone around her is also insane, and exactly the same way. They really cannot talk different between seven day of herd up, someone they personally know. They believe that the feelings they have about this person they imagine need to be. intimacy resentment, hatred pity, or as real as the feelings they have about their own friends. They makes me wonder whether celebrity culture is sort of the tassysized of building emptiness. by religion  a malignant growth where the sacred used to be. Oh, nice. How high is that? That's some, it's amazing. Guys, great show. Okay, I just say, I don't know. My little neighbor, Grant, is that it was longer? Do you mind I just maybe think something? Can I just say, hey, well, hey, well, I'm sorry. That just made me think of something. Is it okay? This is what called, Moby Dick? Oh no, right now. Can I? Is it okay? If I just read the whole thing,  what, here we go. It was age one, that was pretty great. I  it. It's great to speak to these adults. Yeah, I enjoyed it. I liked it. It's my old. Okay.

We're starting to love. Yeah, we just said you want to do You do it I can't speak this as he likes to on loud as he decides what what's going on over here Kind of you something about maybe I want me to review something else this is shorter, but this is as you said trick, please Okay, okay, let's hear I got you got you with you said It's a dumb man and don't peel the knee for it to be short, but the way I've never used my notes out so much as in this fucking Yeah. You're trying to think that. Yeah, it's right now. So this is, this happened last year. This is a true story. So this has to do with your Christmas party. Years go by. Jason never gets invited to come. It's Christmas party. You get invited to that. Right. And he's brought it up before. Right. We may be when he came on the show. Did he bring it up? Yeah. I know you would shine pretty well. Yeah. I don't know Jay. He's so no luck. So, but a couple of times it's coincided multiple times with another mutual friend for us. Christmas party. Yeah. And so, how much be fair, she's a mass of stuff. She's a mass of stuff. She's got, I mean, there's that, she says, a couple of clicks above me, and I give that up, she should be. But you're part of very well-attended. It's a very richy affair. Yeah, a lot of glossy names. Yeah, yeah. So people often go either to coldness first, and then in this person's one vice versa. So if you're coming from this other person, say a bunch of times I've gone to coldness, and then I've gone over there. And then I've decided, did you hear this? Come from Cone. Yeah, it's  the fucking so mad that he has been invited. Yeah, it's a big deal about it. And then when I heard that he was, so I kind of did one with Biden to keep it going. Even worse, we did a live swarming show in Boston. Cone came out. Jason gave you shit in front of a live audience. That you said for my hometown. You're home town. And you said for sure next year, that next year you took the other one. Right. He was happy, right? Nobody was happier than he did. He was sweet. He was sweet. To me it was... one of the best all time bit. I just I love that he wasn't invited. It was better than he wasn't invited. Wait better. Okay so now he's really pissed. Finally last year he would invite. Yeah and he's all proud about. He's  well that invited to think and then he's second he's   first of all he was  I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to make it because I got another party. Yeah. At which point I hear this but I don't go.. to the big so I get tone in to come on fire show secret secretly and then get it and so is it that they've been talking about the prison party about go to the they're not a list of the same in it's on soon but I'm listening here I was here listening and you guys say so a Jason you think that's right no these great casual these can't and it's because I don't know how to deal to I bet you got this the percentage Goodnight animation I went after Batman. He lays into hilarious. We're done. So then, gone long after that. If I may bring up a touch of you actual, this is real personal. Yeah. So it's okay. I know what it is. Yep. The family. Yep. My parents saw that. So, well, first let me just take the time  that. I haven't here. I wrote it down last year because the time went so good. Yeah. And so I hear that your dad has swing attacks. That there is a next day. I said, hey, listen, sorry to hear about your dad passing some of your love from ARP in the years. You, though, thank you, Will, to be honest, I blame Baton. For the death of my father, the day after his mother dies. Yeah. So, I wrote, it's not a terrible theory. And text me back. He killed my dad. Oh my God! My dad! My dad! Can I say, can practice? My dad would have left it. So. So, so, , so then, baby, baby, I tell baby this, we're done, we're doing a thing that day, so he, the next day, baby texts you and he says, or that tells me you're on the day. Yes. And Conan texts, baby, he says, baby, do yourself a finger, a favorite, turn yourself in. Yeah. Two days after your dad passes, of course, your mom. past. Yeah, which we did I did not see come. Which in us coming. So I text you two days after I knew your boss I said no. They've been asking for your sister's treated dress. Oh, okay, I do. Yeah, and you were busy that week after  the day and half when you did the back just seeing this now fantastic. 625 boys in 3-12. See it. Tell me even to make it look  a rocker I swear to god this is how I agreed Everyone has their way and And I forget who is a something at the time was  we might have been shot and something at the weird out there What do you think I go this is what he wants? Yeah, this is what he wants right now. Yeah, so I have to do bits Yeah, I want to know the vibe and obviously obviously I would look at you Yeah, I'm not that we're gonna honestly that was still to make a book  a book. I'm a sick person but I do know my parents who I'm very certain about but they I just a big driving force in the light was making them last. And I did used to think about it. I don't want to do it on me. My parents are gone because that was the whole reason I did everything. But I remember it very much wanting to, I don't know, connect. It was so comforting to screw around with you guys at that moment. It just was. And so, if that makes me a mad man, then so... No, I get that. I think that all of my great buddies say, I can slap that super-pump buddy , , if you did laugh, you cry. So, yeah, , they're sort of in that same area. You're still emoting, you're still feeling your kind of doing it. different way. I totally get that. There've been so many times people call it the Allosiova. Whatever it is. But I get that. I can't wait to my period of time. I don't just have got so many bits. Oh my god. I know the feeling. I know that I haven't been doing everything. My sad was  I feel great. I got this baby man. I'm trying to take. the brakes. I guess they're gonna go, they're gonna go and expis this  that. No one said cut the brakes and you can't make a car crash by cutting a wire in your Don't worry, I don't care if it's Tesla, would you do I cut the brakes with this big scissors? they did in the 1920s. I have to mention we have there's so much to talk about with you but I watched your move lesson. Is this thing I and I was very pleased and I'm really proud of you as a friend and I'm really happy for you because you're really magnets in this film and then I just fucking do  Bradley Cooper who do directs the mood. He has a part in and he's really funny as  a shlub as a character and a friend of yours and it was really fun to see that. or it turns gray, but I was looking at it, I was thinking, I remember you once telling me that your big fear in life was being caught trying. You said that to me once, I said, hey, just someone did not try. And I know that stealing and it's why we gravitate towards comedy because you can joke around if something doesn't quite work, you can make that fit. Just be a shape-shifter all the time, have to stick to you. You plant your feet in this project and you're another person and it's dramatic little and I'm very proud of you for doing it Well first of all, thank you. Thanks a lot. Yeah, there is there's a lot of truth in that I think that along now those lines I spent a lot of time Being very cynical a lot of things and because it's easy. It's kind of it is easy to hide behind me And I get people shit, , he's a target a little podcast, we hear people use the term story teller. Man, yeah, I know nine more and one for if I wrote it and he said it, but you don't mean  a couple of times, and then I get, no one's an actor right now. Yeah, I was , I think I'm, I love to tell stories. It's acting. Yeah, it's acting. But, but I get now a little bit more, and again, I don't see myself differently in any way, but I do get it, and I find myself, yeah, that if you have to do that thing, we have to, kind of phone it and be it and there is a vulnerability to it and I can't write it off as a bit and I can't at the end, oh my pants down and make parts out. So in that way for me it was scary and instantly, I feel very vulnerable even about people watching when I knew that you were going to watch, they said rarely said that they sent it. for you guys to feel . And even Sean and Scottie, you're in it. Yeah. They just watched it the full cut a couple days ago, the final, and I remember just waiting for his reaction. He's my friend, loves me. My partner, we worked together, well this was stuff in our favorite. Oh boy, what if they pick us up? But here's a thing. You initially were quite a sit-in drum. That's what you weren't in the deal. That was, and if we went back to you in your 20s, this is what you were interested in. This is why I moved to New York from Toronto, truthfully. And I was joked, of course, again, it's a nice cover that I was young enough and dumb enough to think that was a pursuit that I wanted to do. And I didn't know anything about comedy at all. I had no, I didn't do sketchups and stand up all of us. And so I kind of backed my way through it. A grim value to a 1954, or sick compounds that need pay the rent in the 90s. the first couple of sick-off pilot auditions from my age and from the primary or primary. Sick. as if it was beneath, I wasn't working. I was just, yeah, I'm making no money. I lived through the worst apartment you could imagine. And I'm thinking , I'm not gonna do a sick-off. What if fucking idiot? Yeah, I am. What? I went wanting to be a dramatic actor. And the other joke I made for Easter Egg forever again is a coverway. People thought my dramatic acting was funny. Well, it's interesting because your dramatic role you play someone who is going through a breakup, married and had kids, marriages running out of gas, guys break up, separate, you would department, you're wondering, past bar, you would, just because you could end cover charts, you'd come in, and it's a high cover chart, you're , why? Well, it's a comedy club, and... He said, well, I don't have that mind, guys. It's a true story. It's an actual true story. It's inspired by this English community, funny guy, John Bish. Who might happen to me not a bad one? Not a fair lot of blocker bars. You are. Can I upload an incident? I don't want you. And I went over there with a friend. There was a big question before going over there. This thing, and I went, and I said next to him, and he told me the story of how we can stand up. and this story was he was separated from his wife getting the course. And he goes to a pub, he has one of the pay to cover and he's staying down for open life. So he gets him to free thinking, I'm gonna go back to the home. And he goes up and the first thing says is I'm gonna get you the book. I think I'm gonna get him. And he becomes  this, he's no ambition to be a standup and there's nothing about center. So that was the image of his friend. But he's the catharsis and keeps going back. Yeah, and then he's a few little good. Yeah. He tried drinking. I tried all that stuff, but this he actually, and this is a guy who would never, never get a therapy, never done that stuff. But going to spun him a crowd of strangers and just kind of talking about his own reality, made him steal better and got released from, which I totally get and I never done standing before. And I can see how that worked. I was curious, you'd pair for this fool, you did stand. Yeah. And you did a lot of stand. Yeah, and will you telling the crowds this is for a movie role? No, well, why don't you get an ass situation? I probably would have said This is for a product and I would have wanted some kind of shield that was the instant Yeah, and actually the truth is the first time I went to do stand up shake bill So see if we try to listen and try to stand up and try to stand up and to go up at the mothership And he said, come down here, we'll do some time. So Bradley and I went down there. This is right after me, it was awesome. When we were in pre-production. And I had it done set up here. And we went down there. And we had all this material that we'd written for various various sets that happened throughout the movie. And the first time I went up there, they introduced me as Alex Novak in Turkish. And so I go out, nervous. This is how again, I know that lots of stuff before we never done that first. And even though I was thinking to do that. So people are sort of, you can see some people who are confused, they're kind of laughing, and there are some people who are clearly fans. Not everybody, but some people are , yeah, okay, and what's the name? What's going on? Can I say something , yeah, I'm Alex, bear with me, hopefully in a year or so, this will make sense, is what I said. Yeah. And then it went on and it did do. set came out came off and went okay it was I was oh that's a lot again the second half of that night Kirkbox's comedian great dude super funny dude he was talking to me and he said he don't need it just go out there and it was such a great he was such a great piece of advice and yeah so I just went I did it and I thought what people are going to take him out of your memory straight down that's okay he doesn't matter it's ended That gave me license and then a couple days later we flew to the next day we flew back to New York and for six weeks. Virtually every night I go and go to the seller night and do three sets of night and then during the day we agree with this stuff and we're trying to track the characters progression and the story and I would go up and introduce me sometimes as a second time up or as first I'd go up as Alex Nobac, people laugh and have a reaction and it didn't matter and having with sitting me almost every time. , the instinct is as , you go up there, you're a performer. You're doing this thing and then parties just , why just weren't making laugh anyway? Right, I just wanna get the laugh cause I'm not right. My eyes will do something to get the laugh. And they don't say that much, oh, it's  you're standing, but and Bradley was stopping, and he'd go, we're doing something different. Look at Ryan. Yeah, they know. Each one Verfügung could expect as it goes somewhere in theonge Benedictine and they tend to play the extremely low voice.
