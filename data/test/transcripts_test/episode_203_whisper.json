  "text": "From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kittle. This is the day. Tariff Circuit, highest rate in nearly a century. The labor market is weak. Over and over again, Trump is metal with corporate America and the country's most important economic institutions. And yet, the S&P at an all-time high, same for the NASDAF, by the way, the stock market. is kept on going up and up and up. Mark is continue to hit all time highs all of this despite lingering uncertainty caused by President Trump's tear of the agenda. Today, my colleague Joe Rennison explains why at least until now, the market estate is so strong in such volatile times. And what we know about how long this can really last. It's Monday. I'mtober. funny. Wow. He wrote a Bloomberg for a real penthouse. In case you ask me what companies have done well since parents, I'm a deeper person. It's a beautiful. I just caught a glimpse of it and that orange that bright orange letter. Very distinctly. Yeah. Can miss it. Yeah. Well, doubt. Welcome to the show. Thanks for being in the studio. Thanks so much for having me. So, we're coming to you because there has been this question on my mind for a while now. And I think it's been on a lot of people's minds. And the question is, what is up with the markers? Because it seems as though every few weeks or so something happens, whether it's a new Trump policy, whether it's weak jobs data, whether it's new tariffs, and at least for the past few months or so, the market has not really had a huge or lasting reaction to those things. Now a week ago, we did see it. to decline when from threatened new tritid tariffs, but then the market seemed to recover. And at this point they've been in all time high territory for a while, and the mystery for me has been, how can that be, how can it be that all these theoretically destabilizing events are not seriously rattling investors? Right, what you're not alone. There's plenty of people asking about exactly the same question right now. He makes sense for my sort of... intuitive perspective when you see so much what at least some people would describe as chaos or at least unorthodox things happening in the world. Why hasn't a bit of stronger reaction financial markets sure is there is a economic consequence to these things? And so it is an important question. And it's important question as well because it's important to understand what the signal is, the other stop on. , markets are still doing very well, shouldn't take that was a sign that things were okay, maybe within a couple of... we're being worried about massive. And so if that is the signal market, and so maybe we should listen to that equally, if there's another explanation, we should understand that explanation well. So you're saying the signals the market sends matter. Yeah, what do you mean that if , believe it or not, a majority of Americans are actually invested in sort of either through retirement plans or pension plans or rise of retail investors, they trade it and it picks up through and pound them in. And then while the stock market might not be the economy, and maybe it doesn't feel  it has this kind of direct effects on most American's lives, the companies in the stock market are huge employers. They employ thousands and thousands of people, they are responsible for the paychecks and many, many Americans. And if those companies start to do worse, or start to come on the pressure, that tends to affect how they spend money in the economy, whether that's our labor or infrastructure projects, or whatever happens to be. So there is this kind of relationship between markets, economy, even if they don't always set the currency. And they're also forward looking. Some markets are constantly trying to understand where we go, not where we are now. And so they're a really good barometer in a sense of where the many, many investors that are putting money to work every single day by installing stocks, bonds, currencies, and other things, where do they see things head? And again, at the moment, from a very cut. we look at the financial markets, one would think that people think we're on a reasonably safe path. Okay, well let's get into the signals that we are getting from investors right now. It feels  maybe one of the most helpful recent examples of that kind of baromers you're talking about was during the initial market reaction to Trump's tariffs back in the spring. The market, stock market and the bond market reaction, particular were initially negative. Many people saw that as. a strong signal to the administration, the administration pulls back. It's not surprising that the market recovered once Trump retreated from those initial really high tariffs, but what was surprised to me was that them were getting kept going up and up even though Trump did eventually raise tariffs. It was more gradual, but those tariffs hit multiple sectors in multiple countries. Can you just explain that, break that down for me? Absolutely. So, come in to this year. in a pretty good place. There was some enthusiasm around something elected as sort of more pro business president, at least perceived to be a more pro business president, and a sort of unleashing of growth and opportunity in the US for big business. And then the tariffs hit. On whilst these were expected, they came through a lot more punitive, a lot more harsh than investors had anticipated. And so there was a sharp reaction, and the reason a sharp reaction kind of kept almost more than the tariffs themselves almost more than sort of. what it said about the direction travels the administration. Was it unexpected? Markets invests hate of certains. They can't price of certainty. It's impossible to price what you don't know. Right. Whether the economy could sustain through such a shock, whether the employment market would come under strength, whether inflation would rapidly rise. And so you ended up with this kind of paralyzing of business and financial markets. Because it just... didn't know what's happening. Now where we are now, sure there's still a lot of uncertainty. Well, we at least roughly know what base rate on tariffs can be. We, roughly know, we at least have some data on what the income from tariffs looks  to the government. Which is considerable, right? Yeah, much higher than people on display to the nation. We've seen inflation not get out in control. Yes, there's pressure in inflation. It's not going There's a little from law, but you just have a little bit of time, it's going to analyze, but I had around, to point out there was at least less uncertainty than there was to consider. So it sounds  what you're saying is we moved from this really unpredictable environment to a relatively, at least, more predictable one. And that with that shift, some of the anxiety has followed it. Yeah, exactly. Certainly, some of the big causes of consternation uncertainty have eased somewhat. And it isn't just curves. We also have a big useful bill. The tax cart that went through, it's an extension of the tax cart, but it still is a tailwind from market. Said, it looks  it's now low interest rates. Those low interest rates will also offer a tailwind from market. It reduces borrowed costs. It boards and reduces costs to companies in the stock market. Tax cuts and reduce interest rates are two things that businesses. What? Good news. Yes. Yes. So there's more certainty in a bunch of areas. Taxes and düşün. industries. Isn't there, though, Joe still a lot of uncertainty just at a systemic level? As in Arthur concerns about how much trust we can have in the ability of the most important economic institutions in this country to do their jobs,  the Fed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these both been attacked by Trump. He's moved fire-fed governor. He fired the head of the labor agency. What's the impact of all that? There is absolutely concern around these things. Whether that gets reflected in markets is a little bit distant. Markets are more, they don't have a system of governments that they are wedded to. What they fundamentally care about is the policy, especially monetary policy, currency, etc. is consistent with the sort of economic fundamentals that we're facing. In authoritarian governments, that in some times we come dislocated, where the politicians are making institutions not with policy making things. And then you can end up with the economic policy that doesn't sit, they're calling me you have. can lead to some very unpleasant results. That's right. We're not in that situation. We're in a situation where yes, the administration is putting a lot of pressure on the federal reserves, that the impression federal reserve pennants through the attempt to file these cut. Yeah, but at least for now, the policy that they are pushing through is consistent with the economic fundamentals we face. So the fact that the run power with mail-over interest rates is more coincidence that that's what Trump wants as well. because for a large amount of year, Trump wanted low interest rates, and it was not the right time how didn't you do that. Now they're alive. And so whether that's a question of independence or lack of independence, if the policy fits the market, then the market would be okay. You saying that the markets don't see the feds move to lower interest rates as a response to Trump pressure, they see it as a response to the economic signals. Yeah. Okay, but the fed is cutting interest rates. If... part because of weakness in the labor market. Isn't that concerning to investors that weakness? It is, but we're at the very early days of that. The late market is still by the stock market for a very strong unemployment. It's still very low. The Fed is sensing or seeing in the data some turn in that strength we are starting to see unemployment to cut slightly. We are starting to see the number of jobs added to slowing down. And so they're trying to get ahead of them. this, this is all the late market action buckles, cracks, and we get to that point. So, all of this, it helps explain why the markets aren't reacting very strongly to some of the more extreme trouble . It doesn't totally explain though why we're in all-time high territory. What's behind that? What's that sort of? Yeah, sure. So I think it's good that we're coming to this point now, because there is a really big driving system market right now. And that's our decision to tell it this. the enthusiasm of the transformational potential of AI is driving stock market through the roof because the biggest companies that stand to benefit from AI adoption are listed in the U.S. These companies have grown astronomically over the past sort of four years or so and they have become these bear myths in market. You have the Magnificent 7 which is a name given to a group of seven stocks and includes alphabet. Amazon Apple Meta Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla. Those seven companies now are more than a third, yes, 500. Wow, I didn't know that. Right? So this 500 companies, seven of them, they're dictating a third, right? That's unbelievable. So if you get a 2% rise in Nvidia one day, it's really hard for the S&P 500 to be down. Great, it's a huge impact, totally outsized. Exactly. A big outsizing impact of the stock. of just a handful of companies and all of those pretty much as fairly as time with artificial intelligence. And  when you have such driving force as artificial intelligence in the market, this is a potentially transformational technology that could drive profit in the stock market for a long time. So even if you're kind of worried about the attack on the feds and pennies or some of the geopolitical situations that are playing out, you probably don't want to miss out on a generational technology. really bolster US markets, the US economy because other people are everywhere one did this trade as well and that brings things to us. Right, it's just very hard to sit this out on the sidelines right now. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, and what about the concerns that this AI boom could really just be a big problem that these companies are overvalued, that they may not deliver on their promise? Yeah, it's a concern. Jane Diamond, chief executive, Jake Morgan, biggest bank union, viewers. the best, he won't do something similar. The market does seem  a value, it does seem a little bit sloppy, there is room for a pullback here. And all we have to look at as some of the sort of classical market metrics for assessing valuation. And I'm pretty much all of those, let's take a company  Nvidia, for example, where blasting through historical pricing, we all way outside of normal ranges on what you would pay for a company with these current track record behind there. And the expectations, , you pay more for a share. The idea at least the highlight is that you think this company is going to be able to make that money in the future and give it back to you. You're trying to profit, right? So if you're paying more for something you think it's going to make more money over the long term. And while some of these numbers look bananas on a piece of paper, then video has met a lot of these targets in recent years. This is a $500 billion company in 2021 that is now over $4 trillion. And so... when Nvidia hit a trillion dollars . D starts saying, wow, that's a bit of value. When Nvidia hits two trillion dollars, do you think it's a bit of value? It's for trillion. Is it over value? Or is it actually worth eight trillion? I don't know. I don't think more of investors know for sure, right? We've almost any big funding change, whether it's crypto and Bitcoin, or whether it's artificial intelligence, or whether it's internet. These are technologies to some extent at least when you don't have the full set of numbers you need or any other platform you can download with share. Facebook, Google, airlines, Amazon, value a company that comes down to belief. Part of what you're saying is that while this could be above all of this AI investment, even in that scenario, it's very hard for investors to not throw their money into the sector because the potential windfall that comes from making the right bet on the right company is just huge. Yeah, and the risk of being uninvested in this environment is, but you can fall behind your mana in half, this ones of you might jump into the edge. Then you're crying, you're gonna suddenly be a failure in changes. And if things  these all related to ¥100,000,000 data will allow you to put in yourpremises. And finally imagine this Morgen starts April 17th, it's increasing investments now. But overall both the investor, starting in growth, is even more consistent. That can be made next month as the end of April CS, strictly bitcoin should be worth to look back to the.com period. The internet revolution, the computing revolution that kind of taken whole earlier, those things are still with us. The technologies are still here, artificial intelligence is going to be going away in time soon. The difference is which companies are going to actually still be around five and two news. Is it going to be a case of one of the many companies that went bust in 2001 or is it going to be a case of being Amazon, which was also valid. Yeah. In similar. ways that were also off the charts back in 1999. That company is still here and we're majoring in balls a lot of money to invest in those 20s  years. Right. One of the concerns comes up with this, however, is that because of the size of these companies and because of how well they're performing more recently, they're also able to then mass a lot of the pain that's sort of such just beneath the surface of the stock market. It's quite possible to have a large chunk of the S&P 500 for example down on the day. Where... some idiosyncratic use about Nvidia or Amazon that lists those stocks one to percent can outweigh the most in the off-siduration once a large chunk of index. So it kind of comes back to the message that the market is sending us. On any given day that the S&P 500 rises, maybe that is a vertical need of administration's policies, maybe that is a vertical need of economy at large. But maybe it seems to just ask this one intelligence. And if you're only looking at that high level. Number, whether the S&P 500 is original folder, then you may be missing some of the underlying concern that still sits between the servants. We'll be right back. So let's talk about some of those underlying concerns, these warning signs in the markets. What do you see? So one of the most obvious would be gold. Gold has been rising for a while at this point, but it's really taken off in recent months. We've gone above $4,000 on gold for the first time. And the signal that sounds is... One of worry, why do people by gold? It doesn't offer any return. It's not going to enrich you in the way that maybe a rapidly rising stock will You go there because you don't lose Right about making it's more about losing that one people tend to invest in gold when they're feeling insecure Yeah, exactly. When we've seen central banks around the world move more into gold That's a bit of a shift away from dollar assets. That's a concern about these sort of safety and soundness of US markets kind of continue in the way that they have for so long. We're also seeing some of that reflected in money moving away from the US stock market. Yes, we have these big tech companies that are leading to the full front of AI, but we also have that for a while. So there's been a lot of money coming in from international markets into the US market chasing those returns. We're starting to see that at a little bit. We're seeing more money going into Europe in months or other emerging as people dialed down some of them. that it's exposure to the US. Got it. So far, you've talked about goals, the prices going up, that being a sign of potential uneasings. You've talked about money moving into international markets. What else? Perhaps, one of the most obvious or classic signs of concern is in default. So companies unable to pay their debts back and as you go into the bankrupt sea or have it to negotiate with their creditors, we saw this recently in the sub-ime goals. So lending space, so, harlow's to people that are considered risky borrowers, it does hint and show there is some fraying of the strengths and book and humor that is driven the economies in its pandemic. And there is some sign consumer life coming under strength. If that follows through, you can see how that lowers consumer spending at Big Book Storts. And then see how that flows through it to stop market as revenues decline to see those are done. That's  more than just a red flag for markets. Those rising defaults are a sign that the growing number of people in the regular real economy are struck. Yeah, it is, but it is still a, at the march. It's not a good question. When we started talking, I mentioned that there had been this drop in the markets after Trump threatened new China tariffs. We know, obviously, that the US China trade negotiations have not been resolved. Having two major economic superpowers in an, escalating trade war certainly doesn't seem  it would vote well for investors Is anyone you're talking to worried about these tensions heating up? Yeah, absolutely it remains as an outstanding course of concern This is the big trading relationship. This is one of the really matters And there is a sense that that relationship is breaking down Yeah, markets are going to be out to that. We saw that this month with some of the back and forth between DC and Beijing where  Trump comes out to the threat of these 100% paras in China, and that prompted a very strong reaction. It shows this sensitivity to the upload, to the potential for a crisis coming out of the last scene. There are definitely still these risks in the area where investors are sensitive. So, how worried should we be? How should we be interpreting these warning signs? Is it a signal that the historic run that we've been on is about? to end? I don't know. I'm sorry. I was really hoping you did. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of fascinating in a purely intellectual way, but it's also backflink, and it's all right to see how little effect, maybe some of the things that we think of as being very impactful in our own lives, have not necessarily translated into financial markets. It also hopefully. the end of this conversation makes a little bit of sense. And this is the reality that companies are dealing with, the reality that investors are dealing with is not that bad. , I think a lot of people will feel mad at it by some, especially those who are being affected by Trump's policies. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking of thousands of federal workers who don't have a job, or the small businesses who are struggling with tariffs. Because I think people, the least going into this term, they expected. in the market city of guardrail to be a check on the press. For them to be maybe one of the only effecting checks on the president's most extreme instance. And that just doesn't seem to be a pack. Yeah, you're right. People certainly did come into this year expecting markets to be more of guardrail than they have been. But , when investors are actually confronted with the landscape in front of them, they have to consider the good arm the bad. Companies are earning. We had double digit earnings growth. In the first quarter, an in the second quarter, we're looking  we might get it in third quarter as well as going to run the season now. And, , when you consider the attack on Fed impendent, we consider some of the more extreme policies that come out from this administration, we'll be sitting all these things. Do you think in video or Google or Apple, these big companies are not going to be making a lot of money in five years. to you? I think I probably can be doing all right. I don't often have opinions. I'm pretty much the model, this opinion I think anyone can have. It's so. And so, , sometimes it's just not absolutely different question than the one investors are asking for it. And that's kind of why you all are here. To say, basically that the markets are filtering all the noise of the volatility in this term or maybe investors are just. holding their nose because they can't resist the poll of AR. Yeah, I mean, I speak to a lot of investors who have talked about how they've evolved their investment process a little bit this year. Learning somewhat from the first term, but then also just trying to really, as you said, filter out the noise, what's real? Yeah, if Joe Biden had tweeted something that resembled a policy announcement, one round the afternoon, then marked with a response. and they're reactive, very quick to take it seriously. We don't have that level of reaction function now, because there is a sense that, , and I do not mean this with any kind of value just attached to it. But the sense that Lee's my investor is that this administration says and does a lot of stuff, it does match you happen. That changes the next bit. And so I think investors have really started to try not to react to those more superfluous things and instead focus on what's real, what's actually happened, what's actually been said and done rather than what might happen. So to a certain extent, markets kind of become inured to the daily seesaw of drama that maybe affects us regular folks a little more. The question is, is there a way in which Trump has also affected the tolerance of it? investors for the actual piece of stuff. They some way by throwing us all into this kind of crazy experiment of what unprecedented tariff rates were deemed to an economy and what unprecedented levels of government intervention were due. Has he made us more comfortable with some things that before we might have thought were a little out of balance? Has he normalized these moves to the point where investors are just... adapting to them. Yeah, , if you'd ask an economist in January, what would introducing the highest tariffs in what a century do to the economy? I don't think that have said, well, I'm pretty sure they have some 2,500 will be a bit of a regretful. But we are a transition. So we can look at what's happening to companies, we can look at what happens to data, we can look at what companies are doing in response to these increased costs. We can see whether they're trying to absorb those costs for the past month. consumers and certainly since the first half of the year it looked  they were absorbing those costs. Now it's looking  they're beginning to start passing those on the consumers that would potentially be another warning sign. But you actually end up just having to look at what's really happening. Not the sort of gut check or emotional response to what's happening. It has to be the reality of it and how is it effect? Company possibility. Make it easily see a future in which the sort of positive start will mark it and continue to outward. I can see a future where some of those negatives are getting creepy, but also our way. But at least for now, a lot of the worst is that we're sort of surrounding this stuff beginning of the year, have not been met yet. Oh, and before let you go, I want to actually make use of that print out that you brought. That was for some help you answer the question about what cup. companies have done well since Trump has issued all these tariffs. So let's hear it, he's killing it. Oh my goodness, all right, let's look at the scores in the board. Looking at this piece of paper in front of me, it's very clear why the market has been doing so well. There's seven companies on here that have risen more than 100% since the start of April. Wow, that's doubling in values as broad calm, talented, Oracle companies that've done big business with this government. It's pretty staggering. I was really hoping you could. you're gonna say the New York Times. A last, a last. But it's easy looking at that list to understand what marketing is doing this day. Come on, Joe. Thanks so much. Thank you. We'll be right back. Separatepared here is what people know making we they bought the country on Saturday wyrouss gathered for day long no kings protest against president shok Fast place in small towns and big cities, and group particularly large turnouts in Washington, B.C., New York and Chicago. The demonstrations were aimed at calling out what protesters see as the authoritarian actions of the press and were largely peaceful. We must get going, all the President's slow-mo off-suss into a authoritarianism. Will we bend to me your grace? And, on Sunday, Israel launched heaviest tax on Gaza since the ceasefire to hold a week ago, and suspended humanitarian aid to the on-play after accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing two Israeli soldiers. By nightfall, following a series of significant strikes, the Israeli military said it had, quote, begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire. recorded 44 Palestinian deaths across the territory on Sunday. The flare up of violence and the temporary halt in aid were the most serious tests yet of the sea-sweyer, which was negotiated under heavy pressure from the White House and signed by Tom himself. Finally, in a brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, thieves made off the jewelry of incalculable vows, according to Francis Interior Minister. The Heissan folded around 930A.
